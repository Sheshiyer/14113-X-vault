## Skills Integration

**Pattern Analysis**: Use pattern-synthesizer-skill to analyze development patterns
```
Synthesize patterns across development logs focusing on:
- Technical implementation patterns
- Integration challenges
- Debugging approaches
```

**Identify development Type 5→8 integration opportunities** (knowledge → action)
