# Psychedelic Information Framework
#consciousness-model #information-theory #pattern-recognition

## Framework Overview
This document integrates Psychedelic Information Theory into the WhyChromosome consciousness debugging framework, with particular focus on the Control Interrupt Model and its implications for pattern recognition.

## Core Components
1. Information Processing Architecture
   - Control Interrupt Model
   - Multisensory Binding
   - Nonlinear Hallucination Patterns
   - Neuroplasticity Mechanisms

2. Integration with Pain Information Architecture
   - Links to [[Pain-Information-Architecture]]
   - Pattern Recognition Parallels
   - Information Processing Overlaps

3. Technical Implementation
   - Pattern Recognition Protocols
   - Consciousness Debugging Interfaces
   - Field Coherence Measurements

## Detailed Sections
### 1. Control Interrupt Model
- Mechanism of action
- Pattern disruption
- Integration points
- Debug protocols

### 2. Perception Frameworks
- Entopic hallucination
- Eidetic hallucination
- Pattern recognition
- Field coherence

### 3. Information Genesis
- Complexity emergence
- Pattern formation
- System integration
- Debug interfaces

## Implementation Notes
1. Pattern recognition protocols should integrate with existing pain information framework
2. Debug interfaces need to account for nonlinear information processing
3. Field coherence measurements must incorporate multisensory binding
