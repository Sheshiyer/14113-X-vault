# Pain Information Framework
`Version 1.0.0 | Framework Documentation 2024-12-11`

## Core Concept Overview
Pain serves as the fundamental information protocol in consciousness, functioning as a base assembly language for all sensory and experiential data processing.

### Key Principles
1. Binary Signal Nature
   - Pain is pure information
   - Constant amplitude (5/10)
   - Variable frequency encoding
   - Base assembly language

2. Universal Input Protocol
   - All senses ride on pain's infrastructure
   - Binary signal foundation
   - Frequency-based differentiation
   - Pattern recognition basis

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Signal Processing Layer
```python
class PainSignal:
    def __init__(self):
        self.amplitude = 5  # Base signal strength
        self.frequency = None  # Variable encoding
        self.state = "active"
```

### 2. Consciousness Interface
- Pain as base machine code
- Action potential transmission
- Binary input/output system
- Frequency-based encoding

### 3. Casino Framework
#### Reward Mechanisms
1. Fortune Teller
   - Prediction reward system
   - Novel event anticipation
   - Pattern recognition rewards

2. Coin Toss
   - 50/50 probability rewards
   - Gambling-based learning
   - Utility curve inversion

3. Novelty Roulette
   - First-time experience rewards
   - Learning enhancement
   - Pattern discovery motivation

4. Prediction Rewards
   - Anticipation enhancement
   - Pattern matching rewards
