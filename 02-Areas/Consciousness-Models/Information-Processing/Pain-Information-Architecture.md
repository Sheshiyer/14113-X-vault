# Pain Information Architecture
`Version 1.0.0 | Pattern Runtime 2024-12-11`

## Pattern Identification
- Pattern Name: Pain Information System
- Category: Consciousness Architecture
- Implementation Level: Core System

## Technical Architecture
```python
class PainInformationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pattern = "Pain-Information-Processing"
        self.state = "continuous_input"
        self.metrics = ["frequency", "amplitude", "dilation", "integration"]
        
    def process_pain_signal(self, input_signal):
        """
        Process incoming pain signals as information packets
        Returns processed consciousness data
        """
        self.frequency = self.analyze_frequency(input_signal)
        self.amplitude = "5/10"  # Constant amplitude
        return self.integrate_signal()
```

## Pattern Analysis
### Core Components
1. Binary Pain Signal System
   - Base information protocol
   - Action potential transmission
   - Frequency-based processing

2. Consciousness Dilation Mechanism
   - Aperture control system
