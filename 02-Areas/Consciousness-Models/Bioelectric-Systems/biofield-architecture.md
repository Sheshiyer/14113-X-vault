`Version 1.0.0 | System Architecture`

## Core Architecture
### 1. Field Integration Points
```javascript
biofieldStructure = {
  melaninInterface: {
    solarInput: "Light processing system",
    circadianSync: "Rhythm management",
    patternRecognition: "Information processing"
  },
  
  witnessSystem: {
    awareness: "Pattern observation",
    integration: "Reality processing",
    optimization: "System calibration"
  }
}
```
