# MOC: Swarm Orchestration (00-MOC-Swarm-Orchestration.md)

## 🎯 Purpose
To define and manage the evolution of the **Tryambakam Brain** and its specialized sub-agent swarm (The Pentagram Team).

## 🏗️ Core Architecture
- [[Specs.md]]: The technical specification for Brain-Coordinator logic.
- [[Tasks.md]]: Active and completed task tracking.
- [[Pentagram-Team.md]]: Detailed roles for Find, Build, Track, Watch, and Create (Upcoming).

## 📜 Jumperz Guide: Core Principles
1. **Fast Context Jumping:** Agents must switch between technical (Annamaya) and poetic (Anandamaya) octaves without context loss.
2. **Stateless Rituals:** Every session is a fresh manifestation; state is persisted in the vault, not the agent memory.
3. **Parallel Dispatch:** Use `sessions_spawn` for simultaneous Annamaya and Vijnanamaya execution.
4. **Chitta Verification:** No file modification without TRACK (Chitta) verifying PARA integrity.

## 🛠️ Components
- **Brain-Coordinator:** Central logic for delegation and synthesis.
- **Communication Channels:** Discord (#swarm-output, #swarm-logs, #swarm-memory).
- **Local Sync Engine:** Bi-directional bridge to `/twc-vault/memory/`.

## 📈 Evolution Log
- **2026-02-09:** Genesis Phase 2: Drafted initial `Specs.md` and defined the Pentagram Team mapping.
- **2026-02-08:** Initial architecture discussions (Foundational logic).
