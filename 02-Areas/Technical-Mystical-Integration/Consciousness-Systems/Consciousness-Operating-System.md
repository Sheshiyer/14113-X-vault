# Consciousness Operating System
`Version 1.0.0 | WhyChromosome Runtime 2024`

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components
```javascript
consciousnessOS = {
    kernel: {
        type: "triune",
        components: ["reptilian", "limbic", "neocortex"],
        mode: "layered processing"
    },
    
    memory: {
        shortTerm: "working buffer",
        longTerm: "pattern storage",
        procedural: "motor skills",
        episodic: "experiences"
    },
    
    processors: {
        fast: "reptilian - survival",
        medium: "limbic - emotional",
        slow: "neocortex - analytical"
    }
}
```

### 2. Process Management

#### Task Scheduling
- Priority-based execution
- Resource allocation
- Context switching
- Process isolation

#### Memory Management
- Experience buffering
- Pattern consolidation
- Cache optimization
- Garbage collection

#### I/O Management
- Sensory processing
- Motor control
- Emotional regulation
- Social interface

## System Features

### 1. Core Services
```javascript
services = {
    identity: {
        management: "self-concept",
        security: "boundaries",
        updates: "adaptation"
    },
    
    processing: {
        realtime: "survival",
        background: "integration",
        scheduled: "growth"
    },
    
    interface: {
        internal: "body awareness",
        external: "world model",
        social: "relationships"
    }
}
```

### 2. Advanced Features

#### Pattern Recognition
- Environmental analysis
- Social computation
