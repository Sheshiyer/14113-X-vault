# Triune Brain Processing Model
`Version 1.0.0 | WhyChromosome Runtime 2024`

## System Overview
The triune brain model represents three distinct but integrated processing systems that form the foundation of consciousness and behavior.

### Core Architecture
```javascript
triuneBrain = {
    reptilian: {
        functions: ["survival", "reflexes", "basic drives"],
        processing: "immediate",
        timeframe: "present"
    },
    
    limbic: {
        functions: ["emotion", "memory", "learning"],
        processing: "intermediate",
        timeframe: "past"
    },
    
    neocortex: {
        functions: ["analysis", "planning", "abstraction"],
        processing: "complex",
        timeframe: "future"
    }
}
```

## Processing Models

### 1. Reptilian Processing
- Binary decision making
- Reflex-based responses
- Basic pattern recognition
- Survival optimization

### 2. Limbic Processing
- Emotional computation
- Memory formation
- Social dynamics
- Learning patterns

### 3. Neocortical Processing
- Abstract reasoning
- Future simulation
- Identity construction
- Reality modeling

## Integration Patterns

### 1. System Interaction
```javascript
interactions = {
    vertical: {
        bottomUp: "sensory integration",
        topDown: "control signals",
        bidirectional: "feedback loops"
    },
    
    horizontal: {
        coordination: "system sync",
        integration: "pattern merging",
        resolution: "conflict handling"
    }
}
```

### 2. Processing Flows

#### Fast Path (Survival)
1. Threat detection
2. Reflex activation
3. Motor response
4. State update

#### Medium Path (Emotional)
1. Pattern recognition
2. Emotional tagging
3. Memory integration
4. Behavior modification

#### Slow Path (Analytical)
1. Data collection
2. Pattern analysis
3. Future simulation
4. Response planning

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. System Setup
1. Initialize base systems
2. Establish connections
3. Define protocols
4. Enable monitoring

### 2. Runtime Management
1. Monitor integration
2. Balance resources
3. Optimize pathways
4. Update patterns
