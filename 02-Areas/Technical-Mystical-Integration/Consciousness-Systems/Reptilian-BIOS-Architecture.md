# Reptilian BIOS Architecture
`Version 1.0.0 | WhyChromosome Runtime 2024`

## System Overview
The reptilian brain functions as a biological BIOS (Basic Input/Output System), providing fundamental processing capabilities and survival-based decision making.

### Core Functions
```javascript
reptilianBIOS = {
    bootSequence: {
        priority: ["survival", "homeostasis", "reflexes"],
        startup: "automatic",
        override: "limited"
    },
    
    basicIO: {
        input: ["sensory", "chemical", "pressure"],
        output: ["motor", "glandular", "thermal"],
        processing: "immediate"
    },
    
    decisionTree: {
        step1: "detect novelty",
        step2: "assess threat",
        step3: "evaluate food potential",
        default: "maintain current state"
    }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Hardware Layer
- PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) as control center
- Brainstem as primary processor
- Spinal cord as data bus

### 2. Operating Parameters
- Low caloric requirement
- High efficiency processing
- Binary decision making
- Immediate response time

### 3. System Architecture
```javascript
architecture = {
    core: "survival processing",
    memory: "procedural only",
    clock: "temperature dependent",
    interrupt: "immediate priority"
}
```

## Technical Parallels

### 1. BIOS vs Reptilian Brain
| BIOS | Reptilian Brain |
|------|-----------------|
| Power-on self test | Autonomic check |
| Hardware initialization | Sensory calibration |
| Basic I/O handling | Reflex processing |
| Bootstrap loading | Survival mode activation |

### 2. System Calls
- Interrupt handling for immediate threats
- Direct memory access for reflexes
- Priority scheduling for survival
- Basic I/O operations

## Integration Protocol

### 1. Boot Sequence
1. Activate sensory systems
2. Initialize motor functions
3. Establish baseline state
4. Enable reflex pathways

### 2. Runtime Operations
- Continuous monitoring
- Immediate response
- Basic pattern recognition
- State maintenance
