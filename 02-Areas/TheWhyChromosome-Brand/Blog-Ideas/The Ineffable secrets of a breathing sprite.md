For a long time humans have strayed off into altered states of consciousness out of sheer boredom being the lowest parameter and that has always been the drive to gather and know what little could be at least of it. 

  

History is the tracks in the snow left by creativity's wandering in the divine imagi-nation.

  

The sheer exclusiveness that stands out between pleasure and bliss during the duration of the experience and how they in turn impact the perspective of life of the eternity of the duration of life we have on the planet left here. We are presented with clear choices that seem to have somehow dissolved into the noise of the new age shepherding of masses with media on a scale we have not emotionally evolved to have coping mechanisms built in place, which is more prominent than ever before. 

  

Chaos is intimately feminine and flirtatious with language.

To pretend that we have inherited this complex level of intelligence mechanism as a sheer natural selection theory , it's laughable at best. At the same time, to be a gnostic and pursue the answers with personal experience being the directional compass. We come to encounter that plants, especially mushrooms, have played an instrumental role in acquiring the capabilities and worksheet manuals of the organs and instruments we possess and co-evolve with the embedded nested consciousness processing communication web. 

  

Through the course of personal journey and inquisitiveness one can come to acknowledge this life as we call it is very rarely explored in the realms of consciousness that we have such a rich history that we haven't fully come to accept it in the norms of cultural equations. This is partially based on the problem of the level of communication we are able to sustain in the concept of large scale communication. Since the advent of the internet, we have had a glimpse of the power of digits, the numbers in the quantitative expression of understanding provide the power the ancient ancestors dreamt of on the shores of their evening siestas. Language, although is fairly a small sub-set in the pie of the communication chart, is pivotal in how we are geared with evolutionary choices to this stage now. 

  

Time is the theater upon which God is becoming. 

  

From the perspective of understanding relationships with the other we come to make meaning, from which stems the experience of knowing a form of electromagnetic resonance creating constructive interference patterns enhancing it exponentially. Hence it becomes crucial to also examine the qualitative nature of the numbers and their associations creating interference. Initially this was the fundamental basis through which one would learn Alchemy or Geometry. 

  

To know oneself, one has to encounter the elf, the assimilation of what remains of the soul becomes the self. 

  

Every religion, teaching group or a cult has harped on the merger or the union, somewhere along the line through Chinese whispers we have lost the most crucial aspect. The merger or the union of "what"?.

  

As a society as complex as what we have accomplished it isn't a mammoth task for us to simulate the experience with the tools at our disposal. Infact, the tools that we needed have ever been present with us and the stigma of the leftist and particular oriented seperatist brain structure has lead us to our own downfall in terms of being too relaxed about the treasure trove we sit upon and yet pretend that it somehow doesn't seem to apply to the lifestyle and the choices we make in our daily life. 

  

The earliest reference to this was made in the Rig vedas of the Hindu mythology of substance so profound, the praises took a few hundred verses to describe an entire civilization and glossolalia begath through it. As a concept in the Rig Veda, and then turned into practical uses and SOPs in the Yajur veda. By this time this state of consciousness was probably as popular as HBO showtime. Practically everyone who knew about any of this was here, A state of consciousness so profound that we can only merely use imagination to grasp it. If this wasn't enough, the further synthesis of this state was re-interpreted as the Sama veda, which is more like the neo classical interpretation of Bach symphony 9 with a little bit of jazz and a few punchy synths. It was explored with the repertoire of musical and rhythmic structures embedded with the emergence of the culture through the exploration of these realms in the waking daylight of daily lives. An intuitiveness and flow to the already existing mind maps of the well explored landscapes of the state of consciousness one would achieve through consumption of soma, which is hard to believe with the current understanding of history we have been passed down generally. 

  

Like always we have an intrinsic nature to over perverse in exploration of possibilities and intense details that Soma Veda wasn't enough, it was too whimsical for the next generations that came after and pleaded to re-interpret them as the Atharva Veda. Which essentially boiled down into nodes that was much similar to what we have come to in the standards of Integrated chip manufacturing. We are comfortable working with the modules and building up a custom experience tailored and catering the needs of the conscious observer. This was quickly then losing the grips on the essence of the core principles, where people pretty much were freebasing open forks on a github project trying their custom blends which always was a pleasant experience. 

This might have been the last stage of the dilution of the concept that it had completely integrated itself as something amorphously new or lost in the depths of human imagination forever. But it's a fair argument to make that it has been left behind if not the same. but some form of it. and that has been precluded by most texts that have any ounce of real teachings into exploring the fundamental aspect of being aware and accepting of the fear of the unknown and hence forth willing co-creator of the universe. 

  

A Coincidence is what is left over when you apply a bad theory to a good question.- PW Bridgeman 

  

In all of this awe and amazement that nature provides through the eyes we can see and that which we cannot have , it requires work! Someone has to do it and the pre-medieval notion of work we have has to probably be the most important thing we need to change our perspective on as a society. Life as we call it is a progressively infinite scaling journey in the game of creation, Matter is compelled out of existence to please the whims and fancies of any and every conscious observer willing to make the effort to notice and acknowledge it.  

  

We seemed to be pushed towards the forces of willing to make the choices and their consequences simply. A mere observation of the cause and effect of one's actions and its respective associations of memories and emotions to it as the current model of societal structure adhering to the norms, But a close examination of the hymns and the interpretations of the shamans, we are being told a completely new concept that by the time we are aware of it, it's almost too late for us to do anything about it. 

  

Life as we know is a preparation for transcendence of linguistic communication. 

  

The experience of the present now in contextual perceptions of measurements is an ode to the mathematical god.  

  

Imagination is a  syntactical dimension free from the laws of space and time. 

  

Language is shedding the primate body that gave it epigenetic properties of speech and linguistic abilities and articulation, in similar ways it shed the rest of organic nature in the inception of DNA through which biology developed us to produce small vocal sounds to express in the dimension of syntactital freedom through the journey towards the divine imagination. In an endeavor to fractally explore and express itself without any stone unturned. 

  

Language is on a journey towards divine imagination through the process of creativity, having begun in chaos and proceeding towards an unseemingly inevitable end back into the chaos re-visioned and re-experienced. 

  

Psychedelic Information Theory (PIT) is the study of nonlinear information creation in the human imagination, particularly in states of dreaming, psychosis, and hallucination. PIT seeks to model the functional output of human perception in order to extrapolate the limits and complexity of information arising in human altered states of consciousness.

  

Why “Psychedelic” Information Theory?

The bulk of human consciousness exists in a linear range which goes from highly focused and alert to deep asleep and dreaming. Most states of consciousness are experienced uniformly and independently of each other along this linear spectrum. For instance, when you are asleep you are not awake; when you are focused you are not daydreaming; when you are anxious you are not relaxed. The fact that consciousness exists in only one state at one time is an indication that the system is linear and stable. When two distinct perceptions or states of consciousness overlap at the same time this is an indication that the system is unstable, and in most cases where divergent states of consciousness overlap the output is viewed as a pathology.State divergent pathologies are typically treated with drugs targeted to amplify the positive traits and/or dampen the negative traits.

  

The convergence of states of consciousness is a seamless perception that relies on rapid frame updating to render external changes in real time. Humans can render changes in reality at roughly 13-15 frames per second (fps, or Hz), which means that our perception of reality fully refreshes itself roughly once every 77 milliseconds (ms).

  

The sensation of hallucinogenic frame stacking indicates that psychedelics may create a temporary frame decay buffer that allows for simultaneous multi-frame analysis and increased complexity of visual comprehension. Subvertingor enhancing the functional limits of visual frame aliasing may be an indication of expanded consciousness.

  

The first limitation is the density and distribution of retina in the eye; 130 million photoreceptors feeding into 1.2 million optic projections, with spatial compression ratio of roughly 100 to 1. Photoreceptors in the eye are distributed in rings with color-sensitive cones clustering towards the center and contrast-sensitive rods filling the periphery.

  

The function of internal visualization is activated by the medial temporal lobe and modulated by neurotransmitter acetylcholine; psychedelics presumably activate this function spontaneously by interrupting aminergic alertness of the forebrain. If psychedelic hallucinations capitalize on the brain’s capacity to produce vivid dream-like images, we would expect the details of a psychedelic frame to match the information profile of a dream frame; low information resolution, softer attack, elongated decay and sustain, low formal durability from frame to frame. This means that state information such as identity, purpose, and context would also elongate and transition quickly from frame to frame.

  

Psychedelic perception presents aprogressive nonlinear bifurcation of recursive self-similar information corresponding to both internal and external perceptual space. The psychedelic layering, bifurcating, and regression of internal and external perceptions creates a timeless, transpersonal perspective of what might be called a nonlinear, fractal, or holographic rendering of time and space.

  

Consciousness is defined here as a dynamical information processing system with specific functions and emergent operating properties, all of which are necessary to maintain system stability.1 The minimum specific functions for any conscious system are: 1) perception 2) recognition 3)memory 4) recall, and 5) behavior. The minimum specific operating properties for any conscious system are: 1) modular coherence 2) linear stability 3) feedback control 4) adaptability, and 5) self-awareness. 

  

The  fractals extend in both directions (Past and Future) from the moment of  “To-Day” (this 24-hour demarcation).  These extensions use the  sexigesimal system in both directions (again Base-60 cycles).   Therefore, note the chart below with fractals of time based on the 60s  toward the Past and Future.  24x60 = 1,440 Minutes; x60 (or 1/60th of a  24-Hour Day) = 86,400 Seconds (1/3600th of a Day); x60 = 5.184M (1/60th  of a Second and therefore 1/216,000th of a Day); 311.040M (1/3600th of a  Second and therefore 1/1.296M of a Day); x60 = ending the scale  reference here at 1/777,600,000th of a Day (1.86624 x 10^10 (18.6624B  time units = 1/216,000th of a Second).  Note that 1.86624 x 10^5 = the  nearest whole number squared approximation for Light Speed in  Miles/Second (432^2 = 186,624).  The “Mile” as a measurement in the  sexigesimal system also holds its earliest references to Ancient Sumer.

  

Looking in the opposite direction now (Future instead of Past  fractals) yields the following incredible symmetry:  One Day x60 (a  simple reciprocal 1/x value) = 60 days, x60 = 3600 days; x60 = 216,000  days (approx 600 (360-day cycles) years); x60 = 12,960 days (approx 36K  years); and x60 again = 777,600 days (2,160 years—the approximate length  of “AEON” (one zodiacal transition) on the Precessional Cycle of 25,920  years).  

Note the obvious symmetry of the above Numbers extending both  backward and forward in TIME scale fractals.  Therefore, we can think of  the “Now” or “To-Day” as the center or Still-Point with each Wave  expansion fractal extending as 60x or 1/60x:  0 (Now):  60x and 1/60x;  3600x and 1/3600x; 216,000x and 1/216,000x; 12,960,000x and  1/12,960,000x; and 777,600,000x and 1/777,600,000x.  See the lower left  “Table”.  

  

You will recognize the above values and their doubled (Sine  Cosine extensions) in both the Sumerian Kings List as well as the  25,920 (Eg:  12,960 x 2; 2,160 x 12; 216 x 2 = 432, etc) year Precessional Cycle.

  

TIME is an equation Pi/W(Omega)+(e-1) =  137.5 (also the Golden Angle).  137.5°/360°= 0.381; Adding ONE to this  value = 1.381.....the approximate Age of the Universe is 1.381 x 10^10  years old.  

  

Only within his own soul can a man find the means to unseal the lips of an Initiate. He Must develop within himself certain faculties to a definite degree, and then the highest treasures of the spirit can become his own.

  

The spiritually experienced know how much they owe to the circumstance, that in the face of all things, they ever again turn to the good, and withhold adverse judgment. But this must not remain an external rule of life; rather it must take possession of our innermost soul. Man has it in his power to perfect himself, and, in time, completely to transform himself. But this transformation must take place in his innermost self, in his thought-life. It is not enough that I show respect only in my outward bearing; I must have this respect in my thoughts. The student must begin by absorbing this devotion into his thought-life. He must be wary of thoughts of disrespect, of adverse criticism, existing in his consciousness, and he must endeavor straightaway to cultivate thoughts of devotion.

  

The Initiate has only acquired the strength to lift his head to the heights of knowledge by guiding his heart to the depths of veneration and devotion. The heights of the spirit can only be climbed by passing through the portals of humility.

  

You can only acquire the right knowledge when you have learnt to appreciate it. Man has certainly the right to turn his eyes to the light, but he must first acquire this right. There are laws in the spiritual life, as in the physical life. Rub a glass rod with an appropriate material, and it will become electric,that is, it will receive the power of attracting small bodies. This is in keeping with a law of nature. It is known to all who have learnt a little physics. Similarly, acquaintance with the first principles of Spiritual Science shows that every feeling of true devotion harbored in the soul, develops a power which may, sooner or later, lead further on the path of knowledge.

  

 If we give the body stones in place of bread, its activity will cease. It is the same with the soul. Veneration, homage, devotion are nutrients making it healthy and strong, especially strong for the activity of cognition. Disrespect, antipathy, under-estimation of what deserves recognition, exert a paralyzing and withering effect on this faculty of cognition. For the spiritually experienced, this fact is visible in the aura. 

  

To this point public awareness of issues concerning drugs has been lacking and public opinion easily manipulated. The situation must change. We must prepare to master the problem of our relationship to psychoactive substances. This cannot be done by an appeal to some anti human standard of behavior that spells more suppression of the mass psyche by dominator metaphors.There can be no "Saying No" to drugs; nothing so asinine or preposterous will do. Nor can we be led down the primrose path by feel-good philosophies that see unbridled hedonism as theHoly Grail of social organization. Our only reasonable course is decriminalization of drugs, mass education, and shamanism as an interdisciplinary and professional approach to these realities.It is our souls that have become ill when we abuse drugs, and the shaman is a healer of souls.Such measures will not immediately solve the general drug problem, but they will preserve the sorely needed pipeline to the spirit that we must have if we expect to restructure society's attitude toward plant and substance use and abuse.An interrupted psychophysical symbiosis between ourselves and the visionary plants is the unrecognized cause of the alienation of modernity and the cultural mind-set of planetary civilization. A worldwide attitude of fear toward drugs is being fostered and manipulated by the dominator culture and its propaganda organs. Vast illicit fortunes continue to be made;the government continues to wring its hands. This is but the most recent effort to profiteer from and frustrate our species' deeply instinctual need to make contact with the Gaian mind of the living planet.

  

Any reappraisal of our use of substances must begin with the notion of habit, "a settled tendency or practice." Familiar, repetitious, and largely unexamined, habits are simply the things that we do. "People," says an old adage, "are creatures of habit." Culture is largely a matter of habit, learned from parents and those around us and then slowly modified by shifting conditions and inspired innovations.Yet, however slow these cultural modifications may seem, when contrasted with the lower-than-glaciers modification of species and ecosystems, culture presents a spectacle of wild and continuous novelty. If nature represents a principle of economy, then culture surely must exemplify the principle of innovation through excess.When habits consume us, when our devotion to them exceeds the culturally defined norms, we label them as obsessions. We feel, in such situations, as though the uniquely human dimension of free will has somehow been violated. We can become obsessed with almost anything: with a behavior pattern such as reading the morning paper or with material objects (the collector),land and property (the empire builder), or power over other people (the politician). 

  

SUPERNATURALISM in religion is that affirmation of the eternal, and of the necessity of a concretely real relationship to the eternal, without which all human tends to become confused and distorted, smk mg into triviality and pointlessness, as being defrauded of Its highest potentiality. It 1s an affirmation that life is a gift as well as a task; it 1s the recognition that each developing phase of that gift 1s the starting point for a task, and that each essential task involves consciousness of a gift as Its impetus and condition.Such a rehg 1os1ty 1s a concrete synthesis of receptivity and art1v1ty, expressed in terms of the human hfe of a cell that knows itself as derivative, not original or selfposilcd. 

  
  

SEVEN THINGS THAT AFFECT YOUR VIBRATORY FREQUENCY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF QUANTUM PHYSICS.

  

Vibration in quantum physics means that *Everything is energy .* We are beings that vibrate at certain frequencies . Each vibration is equivalent to a feeling and in the "vibrational" world , there are only two types of vibrations , the positive and the negative . Any feeling causes you to emit a vibration that can be positive or negative.

  

1st.- THE THOUGHTS

Every thought emits a frequency towards the Universe and that frequency returns towards the origin , then in the case , if you have negative thoughts , of discouragement , sadness , anger , fear , all of that turns towards you . That is why it is so important that you take care of the quality of your thoughts and learn to cultivate more positive thoughts .

  

2nd - THE COMPANY 

The people around you directly influence your vibrational frequency . If you surround yourself with happy , positive , determined people , you will also enter into that vibration. Now if you surround yourself with complaining , cursing and pessimistic people , be careful ! Well , they may be decreasing your frequency and as a consequence preventing you from making the Law of Attraction work in your favor .

  

3rd - THE MUSIC

The music is very powerful . If you only listen to music that speaks of death , betrayal , sadness , abandonment , all that will interfere in what you vibrate . Pay attention to the lyrics of the music you listen to , it may be decreasing your vibrational frequency . And remember : You draw into your life exactly what you vibrate .

  

4th - THINGS YOU SEE

When you watch programs that deal with misfortune, death , betrayal , etc. your brain accepts that as a reality and releases a whole chemistry in your body , causing your vibrational frequency to be affected . See things that do you good and help you vibrate at a higher frequency .

  

5th - ENVIRONMENT

Space,House,Workplace**Whether at home or at work , if you spend much of your time in a disorganized and dirty environment , this will also affect your vibrational frequency . Improve what is around you , organize and clean your environment . Show the Universe that you are apt to receive much more . Take care of what you already have.

  
  
  

6th - THE WORD

If you tend to complain or speak badly about things and people , this affects your vibrational frequency . To maintain your high frequency it is essential that you eliminate the habit of complaining and speaking badly about others . Then avoid making dramas and victimize yourself . Take responsibility for the choices of your life .

  

7 - THE GRATITUDE

Gratitude positively affects your vibrational frequency . That is a habit that you should incorporate right now into your life . Start to thank for everything , for the good things and those that you consider not good , thanks for all the experiences that you have lived . *Gratitude opens the doors for good things to flow positively in  your life.*

Lectures of the Three Degrees in Craft Masonry

  

Is a series of manuals on Freemasonry that are arranged in the form of catechism to be memorized. They cover rituals and symbolism associated with the three degrees of Craft Freemasonry & in question and answer form, The question and answer procedure was the traditional way in which Freemasons were instructed in Masonic ritual and symbolism before printed ritual books became more widely available. Usually, the members of a Masonic Lodge would sit around a table and the Worshipful Master would ask set questions of each member in turn to test their knowledge of the Masonic ritual and moral teachings.

  

Replies and questions were stylized and a Freemason would have to demonstrate proficiency in answering the questions about his Masonic Degree before he would be allowed to proceed to the next degree. These catechisms became known as “Lectures of the Craft” and were gradually developed into a comprehensive instructional system that covered not only the ritual and symbolism, but also the spirit and morals of Freemasonry.  

  

Veils of Negative Existence.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdTYVabXcJvTCQlhYAr2sEC4i9gu407fa2uP7rpU6GkYFC5ASLmnYypW1-Qmx5VqNXLpVcg7fbAAwfWmXrImMfK2e8jpt-terLsX6OUZ5zULZXzJ83V7pNBieti58_q7F4gqtZoG4JJBlcEYb_FA2Y2veeaM8mPUM7tLIXY1wQtgbRbKK0X?key=qK2Cs-eJHRohSvS8qqOETw)

  

Within the Mystical system of the Qabalah, there are three Veils of Negative Existence:

  

Ain (“Light”)

Ain Soph (“Without Limit”)

Ain Soph Aur (“Limitless Light”)

  

Within, or beyond, these Veils are everything that is not. In a sense, they represent Pre-Existence, the state of all things before they make their initial Manifestation in Kether, the first Sephira, or Sphere of Existence. There are three Qabalistic Veils of the Negative Existence, and in themselves they formulate the Hidden Ideas of the Sephiroth not yet called into being, and they are concentrated in Kether, which in this sense is the Malkuth of the hidden ideas of the Sephiroth. The Limitless Ocean of Negative Light does not proceed from a Centre, for it is Centreless, but it concentrates a Centre, which is the number one of the Sephiroth, Kether, the Crown, the First Sephira; which therefore may be said to be the Malkuth or the number ten of the hidden Sephiroth. Thus, Kether is in Malkuth and Malkuth is in Kether.

  

First is Nothing, or the Absence of Things, אין [Ain], which does not and cannot mean Negatively Existing. Second is Without Limit אין סוף [Ain Soph] “i.e.”, Infinite Space. This is the primal Dualism of Infinity; the infinitely small and the infinitely great. The Clash of these produces a finite positive Idea which happens to be Light, אור [Aur].This word [Aur] is most important. It symbolizes the Universe immediately after Chaos, the confusion or Clash of the Infinite Opposites. א [Aleph] is the Egg of Matter; ו [Yod] is Taurus, the Bull, or Energy-Motion; and ר [Resh] is the Sun, or organized and moving System of Orbs. The three Letters of [Ain] thus repeat the three Ideas.

  

It is very difficult to explain the Negative Veils, because they represent a Reality (or lack thereof) that is, by definition, beyond human comprehension. Since it does surpass all finite understanding, immutable and boundless as its expenses are to the human Mind whose most profound speculation could not approach to the faintest adumbration of what It is in Itself, it must ever remain a mysterious Emptiness - Nothing.

  

Ain Soph is neither Spirit nor Will, but rather the underlying condition or material for both, as well as being the ultimate cause of Matter and Force. Such things come into spontaneous Existence from the Negative Veils because of Cyclic Law, which can be identified with the “Will to Manifest.” This law states that the Light [Ain] is normally in a state of Quiescence, moving in constant motion in a perfect Circle, as an Ouroboros. However, from time to time, the Light concentrates on itself and becomes polarized into Spirit and Matter. The mechanism for this process is unclear, so it cannot be understood in any reasonable sense. But whatever the method, the result of the process is the concentration of Infinite Light in Kether.

Itzhak Bentov - The Cosmos

A Brief Tour of Higher Consciousness: A Cosmic Book on the Mechanics of Creation”, 2000.

  

The DNA-like Spiral is made up of many Universes linked together in a strand. Each of the Seven Rings of the Spiral is composed of Seven Universes, making a total of 49 Universes in our Cosmos. Bentov recognized what appeared to be the first letter of the Hebrew Alphabet at the top, representing a ‘Godhead’ of sorts, but was told that his interpretation was backwards. The seers of Ancient Times had perceived these things as well, and incorporated them into the Hebrew language.

  
  

They were like scientists, they were like explorers, they didn’t have a myth that encompassed it. They were technicians of myth which they presented back to their societies, and this is something that is very important to realize about shamanism as it is being packaged and sold in this society. A shaman is primarily a theatrical entertainer. They are not putting on the show for themselves, but in this society people actually become actors on their own stage. I maintain from spending time with them that the shamans do not believe in the powers of magic words, crystals, healing darts, and so forth and so on. They manipulate these things the way a stage magician manipulates rabbits, hats, saws and boxes with women inside them. They understand what 3 it’s for and how it works, and these things are manipulated to create an effect on other people, but the shamans understand that the real magic is the magic of sign, symbol, and language, and that by manipulating cueing, by manipulating expectation you can lead people to a fundamental confrontation, not only with themselves but with the Other.

  
  
  
  

THE DOMINATOR INHERITANCE 

Our culture, self-toxified by the poisonous by-products of technology and egocentric ideology, is the unhappy inheritor of the dominator attitude that alteration of consciousness by the use of plants or substances is somehow wrong, onanistic, and perversely antisocial. I will argue that suppression of shamanic gnosis, with its reliance and insistence on ecstatic dissolution of the ego, has robbed us of life's meaning and made us enemies of the planet, of ourselves, and our grandchildren. We are killing the planet in order to keep intact the wrongheaded assumptions of the ego-dominator cultural style. It is time for change. 

  

THE TECHNIQUES OF ECSTASY 

Not all shamans use intoxication with plants to obtain ecstasy, but all shamanic practice aims to give rise to ecstasy. Drumming, manipulation of breath, ordeals, fasting, theatrical illusions, sexual abstinence-all are time-honored methods for entering into the trance necessary for shamanic work. Yet none of these methods is as effective, as ancient, and as overwhelming as the use of plants containing chemical compounds that produce visions. This practice of using visionary plant intoxicants may seem alien or surprising to some Westerners. Our society regards psychoactive drugs as either frivolous or dangerous, at best reserved for the treatment of the seriously mentally ill where no other effective method is available. We retain the notion of the healer in the figure of the medical professional who, through the possession of special knowledge, can cure. But the specialized knowledge of the modern physician is clinical knowledge, removed from the unfolding drama of each unique and particular person. 

  

A WORLD MADE OF LANGUAGE 

The evidence gathered from millennia of shamanic experience argues that the world is actually made of language in some fashion. Although at odds with the expectations of modern science, this radical proposition is in agreement with much of current linguistic thinking. "The twentieth-century linguistic revolution," says Boston University anthropologist Misia Landau, "is the recognition that language is not merely a device for communicating ideas about the world, but rather a tool for bringing the world into existence in the first place. Reality is not simply `experienced' or `reflected' in language, but instead is actually produced by language. "4 From the point of view of the psychedelic shaman, the world appears to be more in the nature of an utterance or a tale than in any way related to the leptons and baryons or charge and spin that our high priests, the physicists, speak of. 

  

For the shaman, the cosmos is a tale that becomes true as it is told, and as it tells itself. This perspective implies that human imagination can seize the tiller of being in the world. Freedom, personal responsibility, and a humbling awareness of the true size and intelligence of the world combine in this point of view to make it a fitting basis for living an authentic neo-Archaic life. A reverence for and an immersion in the powers of language and communication are the basis of the shamanic path. 

  

By entering the domain of plant intelligence, the shaman becomes, in a way, privileged to a higher dimensional perspective on experience. Common sense assumes that, though languages

are always evolving, the raw stuff of what language expresses is relatively constant and common to all humans. Yet we also know that the Hopi language has no past or future tenses

or concepts. How, then, can the Hopi world be like ours? And the Inuit have no first-person pronoun. How, then, can their world be like ours?

  

The grammars of languages-their internal rules-have been carefully studied. Yet too little attention has been devoted to examining how language creates and defines the limits of reality.

Perhaps language is more properly understood when thought of as magic, for it is the implicit position of magic that the world is made of language. 

  

The sprites and the elementals are Autonomous fragments of condensed form of psychic energy which have temporarily escaped from the controlling power of the ego.

  

The world of ongoing becoming, the phenomenal world undergoing the formality of occurrence is an interference pattern created by the interplay and inter-mingling of the 64 species of temporal time elements described in the I-Ching

  

Universe is an Ebb-and-flow of novelty. Reality is the occurence of the dynamic forces between Habit and Novelty. 

  

The conviction and the adoration of familiarity has led us unto contempt from the ever growing engulfment of novelty. 

  

The completion of ages is in a way a process of refinement of novelty and hence necessary.

  

A demon is who once was a monster but a deity befallen into the clutches of habit and pleasure. 

  

The empire of science : Science has exhausted itself and become a mere technique still able to perform its magical trick but has no claim to metaphysics with a thorough meaning. 

  

The fifth state of matter literally “quintessence” from Latin quinta, quintus "fifth" +essentia (essence) "being, essence,"abstract noun formed in imitation of Greek ousia "being, essence,"from ontos, einai "to be", fromessent-, esse "to be".

  

“We can disintegrate our defects and dissolve the psychological “I” only by means of this science of transmutations. We can modify our errors, transmute the vile metals into pure gold and command only by means of the science of transmutations.” 

  

“We need to transmute the lead of personality into the gold of theSpirit. This work is only possible in the laboratory of the Alchemist.” - 

  

AlchemyAl / El: “God”Khemia / kimia (Greek χημεία)which means "to fuse or cast a metal." 

  

Laboratorium Laborem (nom. labor) "labor,toil, exertion; hardship, pain, fatigue; a work, a product of labor"

  

Oratorium "place of prayer"

  

This segues into how music can be looked at as an aid and ode to our devastating aberrations caused by habit and pursuit of particulars without the vision of the concept driving it. 

  

The classical system developed in the early ages of the sixth and the tenth centuries explored the and surfed the soundscapes as we do the web in the 20th century performing feats we can only imagine our synths to function. This was clearly passed down through oral traditions and till today we can experience the relics of the past through the trails they have left behind in the form of their compositions and raagas.

  
  

Thaat System of Classification 

  

An important way of Raga classification is the Thaat system. A certain arrangement of the seven notes with the change of shuddha, komal and teevra is called a Thaat. Every raga has a fixed number of komal or teevra notes, from which the thaat can be recognised. There are several opinions in this matter. According to Pandit V.N. Bhatkhande, the 10 thaat's used to classify ragas are 

  

  

1 Bilaval : All shuddh or natural notes. 

  

2 Khamaj : With ni note as komal. 

  

3 Kafi : With ga, ni as komal. 

  

4 Asavari : With ga, dha, ni as komal. 

  

5 Bhairavi : With re, ga, dha, ni as komal. 

  

6 Bhairav : With re, dha as komal. 

  

7 Poorvi : With re, dha as komal and ma as teevra. 

  

8 Todi : With re, ga, dha as komal and ma as teevra. 

  

9 Marwa : With re as komal and ma asteevra. 

  

10 Kalyan : With ma as teevra only.

Based on Rasa (Emotion) : 

Bharata Muni enunciated the eight Rasas in the Natyasastra,an ancient work of dramatic theory. Each rasa, according to Natya Shastra, has a presiding deity and a specific color. The aura of a frightened person is black, and the aura of an angry person is red. Bharata Muni established the following.

- Sringaram - Love, attractiveness. Presiding deity: Vishnu. Color: light green 
    
- Hasyam - Laughter, mirth, comedy. Presiding deity: Pramata. Color: white 
    
- Roudram - Fury. Presiding deity: Rudra. Color: red 
    
- Karunyam - Compassion, mercy. Presiding deity: Yama. Color: gray 
    
- Bibhatsa - Disgust, aversion. Presiding deity: Shiva. Color: blue 
    
- Bhayanakam - Horror, terror. Presiding deity: Kala. Color: black 
    
- Viram - Heroic mood. Presiding deity: Indra. Color: yellowish 
    
- Adbhutam - Wonder, amazement. Presiding deity: Brahma. Color: yellow 
    
- Santam - Peace or tranquility. deity: Vishnu. Color: blue
    

  

A ninth rasa was added by later authors. This addition had to undergo a good deal of struggle between the sixth and the tenth centuries, before it could be accepted by the majority of the Alankarikas, and the expression Navarasa (the nine rasas), could come into vogue.

  

Classification of Ragas give out a number of important messages for all artists and students and listeners of the ragas:  

  

a. Ragas have personality and emotion 

  

b. They have relationships with each other 

  

c. Ragas are closely related to nature and time of the day or season of the year 

  

d. They can be associated with colors and moods 

  

e. It is highly related to spirituality   

  

The artist of Classical Music while performing tries to bring out all these aspects of the raga and this is what makes Eastern Classical Music so intense and spiritual in nature.

So, the Symmetry Theory of Valence. Just defining terms so that we’re all on the same page. There’s this thing called core effect which is basically what you get when you apply dimensionality reduction techniques to any one of many areas of psychology. There’s a surprisingly robust pair of dimensions that emerge in co-occurrences of words or even descriptions of behavior. These two axes, arousal and valence, seem to account for about 60% of the variance in terms of what information emotional words contain. And I mean, roughly speaking, arousal is the level of activation, how energetic you are, and valence is how good you feel. Most of what I’m going to be talking about is valence. That said, you need to also consider arousal in the picture to know what this is all about. Just a few examples: you have high arousal, high valence, so that would be kind of exciting and anticipation. But you also can have high energy, but not feeling really good, and that would be kind of anxiety or anger or irritation. Likewise, you have depression, which is low arousal, low valence, and serenity is peaceful, blissful calm, that would be low arousal, high valence.

This is just one example of one of the ways in which you can recover these dimensions of valence and arousal. [This](http://qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/) was a little study we conducted years ago. We were studying people who have experiences with all kinds of substances online. We were giving them the survey, where they were going to describe a particular substance along something like 70 different dimensions. Then I conducted factor analysis on that data set. Interestingly, we have three core dimensions of valence or valence-related axes, which give you a sense of, okay, what is the space of possible effects that you can get from some substances. There were actually six dimensions that emerged, but three of them are valence-related:

We have slow euphoria, which is equivalent to low arousal, high valence with top terms like calming and relieving. The negative predictors of it would be something like anxiety, producing difficult bodily discomfort. Fast euphoria is the sort of thing you get with stimulants, you know, energizing, sociable, the opposite of feeling spaced out and confused.

This is just a kind of change of basis, where you still get, in a sense, the valence dimension emerging out of this dimensionality reduction analysis. If you were to apply just one dimension, you know, if you ask the factor analysis to just give you one factor, it is going to be the valence factor. That’s the axis that accounts for most of the variance for the effects of drugs.
