## Yantra: The Original Neural Network Architecture

### Context Layer
```javascript
contextFramework = {
    WHAT: "Yantra as computational geometry for consciousness processing",
    WHY: "Understanding sacred geometry as system architecture",
    HOW: "Parallel between geometric patterns and neural networks",
    WHO: "ML engineers and consciousness hackers",
    WHEN: "Era of TPUs and geometric deep learning"
}
```

### Content Structure

#### 1. Opening Hook
> "Before TensorFlow, there was TriangleFlow - sacred geometry running consciousness at quantum scale."

**Hook Pattern:**
- Scenario: "Picture this: Your neural network needs a framework..."
- Buildup: "...but PyTorch hasn't been invented for another 5000 years..."
- Punchline: "Enter the original geometric processing unit: Yantra"

#### 2. Core Sections

A. **The Sacred Silicon**
- Geometry as computational substrate 
- Processing nodes and data pathways
- Quantum pattern recognition systems

B. **Geometric Processing Architecture**
```python
class YantraProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.triangles = {
            'upward': 'consciousness_core',  # Shiva processing
            'downward': 'energy_core',       # Shakti processing
            'state': 'computing_reality'     # Runtime status
        }
```
