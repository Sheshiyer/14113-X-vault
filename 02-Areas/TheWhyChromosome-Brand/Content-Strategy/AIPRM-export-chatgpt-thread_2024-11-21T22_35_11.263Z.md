[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:01] uh today i wanted to discuss elizabeth holmes some of you probably saw in what we're calling news these days that she uh was on trial
[00:16] and found guilty of fraud and we could certainly do a whole show about her but i think that that we've missed a lot uh by focusing so much
[00:31] on her instead of on who believed her and that this 19 year old was able to um somehow subdue the discernment of henry kissinger
[00:50] bill perry george schultz sam nunn bill frist gary ruffhead the james mattis dekova chevic
[01:02] riley bechdel william foggy sony balawani and elizabeth holmes that these people all believed in what she was saying
[01:18] so much so to invest money to put their own reputation on the line um and back her and the media will tell you that this is an isolated incident they will explain
[01:37] that uh that the the um the seat is over that the con is is in and now everyone out in the world who's there
[01:51] is legit now because we figured out what she was but if you but if you really look at it owens received the under 30 doers award from ford's magazine which is ranked
[02:04] number 73 in its 20 2015 list of world's most powerful women she was named woman of the year by glamour honorary doctorate of humane letters from pepperdine university awarded the 2015 horatio algers alder
[02:19] award business person of the year fortune named her would later name her the world's 19 most disappointing leaders new york times itself called her accusations
[02:33] a wake-up call for sexism in tech the 26th united states secretary of defense was fooled by
[02:47] a 19 year old dropout from stanford the person who made it their job to defend your border during afghanistan iraq and 911
[03:00] was unable to uh subdue the mastermind of elizabeth holmes and it hasn't stopped elizabeth's home's
[03:12] been exposed and just last year she was married and started a family she's not hurting she's not um really paying for anything and two doctors two senators two
[03:31] secretary of states two secretaries of defense two of the highest command in both the navy and the marines and two ceos one in engineering and one in banking and the director of the cdc
[03:47] and a stanford dean all fell for that this has nothing to do with elizabeth holmes does it does it it really has very very little to do
[04:03] with her at all that you're seeing something larger happen that you're seeing the true nature of what's happening in our world and i don't i don't think that uh
[04:31] that you need to even be upset about this that when i first started uh working on this um first the part of me was kind of like yeah it's just a fraud blah blah blah
[04:43] blah blah blah but but if you unpeel the onion and you still have the uh the appetite for for the tears you're gonna see that that there's some profoundity here
[04:57] in that what we call truth is really meaningless that no matter your skill level no matter your intelligence no matter your power in society no matter your financial
[05:11] stability that none of those things mean anything at all to your rational mind if it's getting in the way of your belief
[05:24] that that belief is really what's running the show and it's not a rarity stop calling it a rarity on the screen is the bernie madoff showing you his
[05:40] perfect perfect spot on record of financial growth absolute stellar record of consistent financial growth without
[05:54] a hitch the most stable market rise you've ever seen between the years of 1991 through 1999 and this man was able to pull in 50 billion dollars
[06:08] because of the belief that he generated from his fund and a man who stole 50 billion dollars died from natural causes natural causes
[06:24] he wasn't hanged in the street someone didn't epstein him in a cell he died of natural causes bernie was supplying a product and that product was belief and that product sold well
[06:39] same with elizabeth holmes and in a last desperate please plea when they were finally uh put to task about the promises they were making if you don't know this the company there most was promising to
[06:56] conduct 500 blood tests from a uh a pinprick and when finally pressed in august 2016 they they delivered a
[07:08] zika testing machine zika the zika virus and i bring this up because the origin of the zika virus takes place in the same county where
[07:21] the parkland school shooting took place where sheriff scott israel is employed and where the voters keep reelecting if elections are real debbie wasserman schultz the very same place
[07:36] where um just a few short miles away there's kennedy space center the very same place where just even a quick one-hour shuttle
[07:50] will get you from kennedy space center to walt disney world that the entire region itself that you're seeing in florida the one that has these catastrophic stories that keep coming from it from the fort lauderdale shooting to
[08:05] the discovery of zika to men landing on the moon to um the entire empire of walt disney literally controlling every single uh cartoon
[08:19] or series whether or not they even created it or not doesn't even matter that the stronghold over mythology and scientism and virology
[08:32] all comes from the same epicenter the exact same location in florida and on the left you see the nasa z1 spaceship prototype and on the right you see buzz lightyear
[08:51] and i know that that we're supposed to understand oh well clearly one's fantasy in one's one's reality but i i i don't think that's true me i don't think that's true i don't
[09:08] actually think that that's how it works i think that these are the same i think this is the same as this and when you look at the cgi that's being passed on to us
[09:24] you look at the uh seven completely different versions of a planet uh you look at even the fact that we're talking about a planet you look at the uh the cropping of of saudi arabia to somehow cover half
[09:38] the earth um you look at the square rotation on the earthrise photo from the moon you look at all the cgi without any film
[09:50] ever recorded from any rocket private or commercial or military or nasa it's never there and the reason why is not really on the shoulders of nasa
[10:11] because nasa's doing the exact same thing that disney's doing they're in the same business one one is for an an older age group i'll give you that but i'd like for you to tell me
[10:28] can you spot the difference between these two photos one of these is from walt disney world the other is from kennedy space center which one of these roller coaster rides is science and which one of these roller coaster
[10:43] rides is fantasy and tell me again just how how easy and clearly it is to distinguish the difference and then tell me how convinced you are that anyone anyone at all that that lives in the world all
[10:57] those people that we see behaving the way they're behaving that they would have no problems distinguishing between these two things either you know the entire state of florida is run by a governor who owns an aerial spray company
[11:17] in order to sell you on the idea that the zika virus is dangerous three million honey bees died in three hours from the spraying of a class 1 carcinogen called naled
[11:30] banned by the united nations and when you think about that place i i think it's profound when you look at that on june 30th of just this summer mayor dean j tran dallas
[11:47] announced that fort lauderdale's received a proposal from elon musk the boring company to build an underground transit loop between downtown and the beach called the la solas loop this represents an innovative and unprecedented approach to addressing
[12:01] traffic congestion and transit needs and that these roller coasters some are fancier than others some have more colorful paint on them than others
[12:14] but one is for kids and one is for adults and it's hard to distinguish which is which this was three years after elon announced on twitter that he had received verbal government approval for the boring company to build an
[12:35] underground new york philadelphia baltimore dc hyperloop that was a lie turned out there was no government approval turned out there's no been plan submitted it turns out that no one even thinks that that's even feasible
[12:52] and no one is signed up to create it and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that it's true this is something more important than truth
[13:11] just a month ago maybe two months ago elon musk came out and announced his tesla bot a five foot eight autonomous robot he gave you the width of it the height
[13:24] its deadlift ability how fast it was the amount of weight it could sustain on its arms its carry load capacity it was presented as if this is a real live thing and we've got this and
[13:43] just just yesterday in in one of my videos comments um i did a live stream where i i showed the press conference or i talked about i'm sorry i think i only talked about the press conference
[13:57] where elon announced this this robot and in the beginning of the press conference there was a human being dressed up to look like a robot and they had a mask over their face
[14:12] completely black face and they were dancing and in the live stream i was explaining that that it was uh it was a fraud
[14:25] and i was explaining that that elon musk was presenting this as something that was true and i was told by by some some viewers uh one of them turned out to be pretty upset is that is that i was the one that was lying
[14:40] that that i was saying that that he was presenting something true when really he he hadn't presented something true at all and that he had made it very clear that that that this was simply a person
[14:53] dancing in a costume and i've certainly looked back at that and and i think if in a court of law you could probably isolate it and say that but but if you actually look at what elon musk was presenting he was
[15:06] presenting to you a confidence a confidence that there was a tesla bot that was being built right now and that it it had been built so much that here is what it looked like here's its height here's its carry
[15:24] capacity here's what it could do here's what it couldn't do here's its demeanor here's its personality type here's how fast it could run here's whether or not you should run away from it
[15:36] and that that itself is is actually uh presenting things that that we don't actually know are true it could be that that this actually is a lie too and
[15:55] just yesterday i saw this so tesla just announced a whole human-sized human-shaped sentient robot this is not a drill this is a
[16:10] thing that really just happened and a lot of things come to mind when hearing that so let's get into it now that's a marquee something um
[16:25] he's like a really big influencer and that guy thinks that's real he thinks it's real he didn't make a comment about oh and there was this really crazy guy dressed in his suit pretending
[16:39] to be a robot he didn't say that he actually told you this is really happening he made it clear to you that this was a factual event and that that's my that was my
[16:52] we'll call it a beef but that was my my issue with it that when you when you unwrap musk there's a lot of tendencies for him to present things that just aren't true
[17:12] elon musk did not found or invent paypal elon musk did not found invent plan or design a tesla roadster
[17:26] elon musk did not orbit a car around the earth he did not create an autonomous taxi that would pay you thirty thousand dollars in revenue he did not fix traffic he did not save the environment he did
[17:39] not reinvent the trucking industry he did not land anything on mars nor did he colonize it he did not invent the solar roof he did not create a hyperloop he did not reinvent air travel with
[17:55] rockets he did not save kids trapped in a cave from a pedophile he did not revolutionize the brick industry he did not revolutionize the building industry he did not make
[18:06] an underground car sled that a vehicle would park on top of he did not send ventilators he said he would send he did not actually make a flamethrower he didn't even fulfill the goal of making
[18:21] a lunar lander for nasa when we'll get to nasa musk is famous for presenting a cgi of a rocket that lands on its butthole stage one
[18:35] that's what he's done and of course this car that you see on the stream he runs a live stream out of a warehouse can i prove that no
[18:48] no do i believe that yes why do i believe that because of everything that he said he's going to do and because of how every time he says he's going to do something he ends up having to come up with
[19:02] something bigger that he's going to do to make you forget what he was already going to do why would someone obsess with colonizing mars be worried about traffic on earth
[19:16] why why would you stop what you're doing to save literally as you called it to save the seed of humanity why would you delay that because you wanted to get into the
[19:30] traffic fixing game why would you do that and can you look at a track record of things that he's produced well james he's launched a lot of rockets
[19:44] i don't know that i don't i've certainly seen a lot of fireworks i've certainly seen a lot of things but when you have a offshore platform
[19:58] that no one's allowed to to see on an autonomous uh landing which no humans allowed to experience i don't know if that happened or not and we live in a world where it is safe
[20:13] to assume that people would have a motivation to lie to you about something especially when you could trace back say the 57 million dollar a day budget for nasa
[20:27] there are motivations and reasons why it would make sense to create something fantastical something that provided amusement
[20:41] something that allowed both kids young and old to experience technology and a fun safe atmosphere
[20:54] there's a market for these kinds of things and it would seem to me that if anyone was to be truly pushing the boundaries of of science right now the very first
[21:08] thing they would want to do is re-establish science as a modality of truth and that the way that you would re-establish that would be by providing tangible zetetic
[21:21] evidence evidence that can be pulled in through the brain and processed through the experience itself becomes the belief
[21:36] but we have this instead we have this instead and i'd like to talk about the mechanics as to why this works i'd like to discuss why does that work why does that
[21:51] work and and i have to ask why because if anyone was to do a psychological profile of musk you would see that he does not actually fit the pattern of genius musk has said that he's terrified of being alone
[22:08] but a genius finds finds these things difficult he finds people difficult a genius will will spend his time in solitude not on camera thank you oh look
[22:23] someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie want to share it with me a genius is a doer not a a a shower i should say not a teller he will show instead of tell it's literally why you end up calling them a genius
[22:39] they typically have poor human skills and i don't mean in the uh uh kind of way of sort of uh stuttering on the point that really doesn't require much thought by
[22:54] hypnotically suggesting we all create a rhythm see i'm doing it right now to provide the background music for your belief to linger it's a dance
[23:09] that we play and musk is playing a dance for you and it doesn't matter that it's falling apart yeah there over a thousand parties are
[23:22] suing elon musk right now right now over a thousand parties are suing him mostly for fraud the solar uh takeover that he did is just one of
[23:37] many many plays he basically uh bought himself uh out uh through this acquisition of solar city these things are not a
[23:52] blip on the screen it's a repeating action that just happens over and over and over again and if you look around in science just like madoff just like elizabeth holmes just like elon musk just like brian cox brian cox
[24:04] was a keyboard player in a boy band he was hired as a publicity spokesman for bbc and you know what they did they called him a physicist and they gave him the title of professor a man has no credentials at all
[24:20] but he's literally the deacon the one out front explaining to you why all of this is real why it's all real
[24:35] and he's charismatic he's uh likable he's uh defense uh like he puts your guard down and he tells you stories that are fantastical
[24:48] fantastical now we can blame these guys we can say it was them it's their luciferian agenda they're a fraud or whatever and hey man go for it but it's not actually going to ever solve the problem because a lesson weights beyond the fact
[25:07] you were lied to that you believed in something outside of you more than you believed what was inside you and that you could look at neil degrasse
[25:18] tyson himself as a kind of virus that you allowed into your field and the symptoms are you find yourself believing in fantasies
[25:33] and when you understand the mechanics of why this works you will notice that rationality means nothing nothing at all when we determine what we're going to believe that it's actually much more basic than that it's even easier
[25:47] to follow when we uh when we discover that musk is a fraud it poisons the grape of reality
[26:06] and as you go out in your world you will find people that that enjoy the grapes of musk that enjoy the grapes of nasa and that when you're seeing those things
[26:19] you are automatically tasting how sour they are and it echoes because you see it everywhere nasa nasa nasa you see it and it's not even ironic and it taints your view of the world
[26:37] and you can't control how often you're gonna see neil degrasse tyson on tv you can try but you're gonna you know already know who he is same with musk same with nasa and so by you knowing it a fraud you
[26:50] automatically lower the level of enjoyment you were having from where it was before it's a very difficult thing to digest
[27:05] that even doubting science ends up kind of like an isolation it's almost like these liars or fraudsters are holding you hostage they're holding your comfort hostage because they're saying hey look
[27:20] i get that you don't believe me but it's going to suck for you not to believe me because you're going to see me everywhere because i'm going to put my face on everything you can see and there's just nowhere you can go so
[27:33] maybe you should just believe me and that argument i think exists on a micro level as you process your data when you are first introduced to musk
[27:46] that concept is in your head that algorithm that prime economy is there it's like hey before you say that he's a fraud just remember man you're going to see that fraud everywhere is it worth it to you
[28:00] you you really are held hostage by it it isolates you from friends and family it it makes you sometimes it would make you a downer and that's because it's not science it's church
[28:16] no one wants to hear you get up in church and say hey guys this is church i just want to remind everybody that this isn't this is just church it will be the same as getting up in the middle of the theater saying hey you know he's acting right you guys know
[28:31] he's acting right destroys the entire illusion it sours the great and when you look at piltdown man the reason why built down man existed for 60 years in maine academic science the
[28:46] reason why piltdown man is listed in almost every textbook is valid until the late 50s sometimes even up into the 70s the reason why that works is not because science was slow it's because science is belief
[29:01] and that people wanted and and basically put up a wanted poster saying we are willing to hire someone who will lie to us about a pig's jaw and there they are
[29:15] the most reputable famous medical scientific journal excuse me scientific journal and museum in all of history had pilt down man
[29:29] for 60 years 60 years madoff holmes musk tyson brian cox built down me
[29:43] this is not an isolated event it's not and even now tesla stock is worth over a thousand actually i don't know what it is today but if you look around 200. look at the date just after 2020
[30:03] people knew musk was a fraud when tesla was 200 they knew he was a fraud then and it just doesn't matter it just doesn't matter which means that musk
[30:20] is a good ceo musk is doing a good job and that his truthfulness really doesn't mean anything just like brian cox the fact that he
[30:33] played keyboards in a boy band for most of his career doesn't really matter the fact that tyson is basically a psychopath no one cares no one cares
[30:47] why because that would ruin the grapes it would ruin the wine and this is so deep guys that one of the most popular skeptics on youtube a guy named thunder foot
[31:03] who busts the all the science myths that you hear still to this day utilizes nasa as a way of pointing out the fraud of musk that it gets that deep
[31:21] that you're watching people make emotional decisions saying look i'm happy to call elon musk a fraud but that doesn't mean space is a fraud and it certainly doesn't mean nasa's a fraud
[31:36] and that someone with a doctorate like like uh like thunderf00t i think he's a doctor in chemistry can't fathom the fraud of the apollo program
[31:50] it ruins too much wine the grapes would be way too sour for that he can't handle it this isn't about science is it it's not and we continue the struggle right we
[32:05] win some we lose some and just yesterday as reuters with 1.36 million subscribers is trying to show you the historians reflecting on the january 6 capital attack of last year
[32:19] you realize you're winning in on that way with 31 watching but then you've noticed that a kova testing site at the getty centers detected la's first case of fluorona a combination of influenza and coronavirus and you notice that no
[32:33] we lose some too there are nine thousand people that have retweeted that maybe some of them were ironic who knows but the point is is that we still don't get it yet

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
32:47] it still hits home and speaking of home it really does make you wonder what is the true purpose of america there's a 19 year old billionaire in a turtleneck
[33:01] 19 hijackers 19 uh state department issuing passports 19 box cutters 19 coveted variants elon musk launched 19 rockets
[33:18] before he had to shut down one of those programs and when you ask what the true purpose of america is could certainly go the route of oh it's so evil luciferian enslavement and man
[33:34] is just too clever because we just keep we're too smart for them but any minute now they're going to enslave us you could look at it that way it's a beautiful belief it's very popular it's a lot of traffic that belief does
[33:48] or you could understand that something else is happening [Music]
[34:08] [Music] what is the flavor of knowing the truth
[34:32] of 9 11. how expensive is it to your palate to look at that and realize you know maybe you don't even know what actually happened
[34:50] but what does it feel like to think that the story that you're told is inaccurate how does it feel to tell that to other people how does that feel when you discuss that right
[35:05] this is the cold truth of it all when you exit the theater the brightness burns it burns it's not bad but it burns seeing fraud is knowing the world's
[35:21] favorite grapes are sour and you don't fit in anymore because what you know takes the joy out of seeing them everywhere you go it's expensive
[35:37] to not swallow fraud and the joy of not knowing holds most of this population hostage but when you decode liberty life liberty in the pursuit of happiness
[35:56] you notice that liberty is the breaking of chains therefore the chains of slavery itself would necessarily be liberty's first ingredient
[36:14] and that the statue of liberty itself the breaking of the liberty bell itself is a process a process that you agreed to go to
[36:27] when your ancestors said i want to come to america and right now the statue of liberty's crown is to stay closed the risk of fire and terrorism is enough to keep tourists out of statue of liberty's crown officials say wednesday
[36:45] calling it the final victory of the terrorists of september 11th and that if you understand or if you look deeper i should say forgive me if you were to look deeper look inside the statue of liberty
[37:01] you would literally see a serpent rising up the spine a kundalini energy that would end in the crown that crown was purposely closed on september 11th
[37:15] because life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is the essence of america and the rising of that kundalini would only occur through lots and lots and lots and lots
[37:29] and lots of trauma why because the trauma makes you decide the appetite you grow out of the appetite for that sugar and you're left with just understanding
[37:44] what's really going on this is why we pretend atrazine is poisoning the quest for sexual liberation that the entire uh pride movement has been us trying to
[38:03] flavor the wine that the atrazine they're putting in our food it's just an accident and that really what's happening is it's not that we're being eugenically uh sterilized by atrazine that what's
[38:17] really happening is we are seeking our liberation through gender dysphoria and that only after enough trauma would you finally decide i don't want to eat this anymore
[38:31] that the way the pizza makes me feel is not anywhere near as wholesome as what it feels like as i digest a brussels sprout your appetite grows you're no longer interested in
[38:44] fake grapes anymore but you're alone not everybody has this and they need something to help them catch up they're looking for more trauma
[38:58] to make their appetite grow and so what does america do america gives you that trauma this man came to fix your terrorism
[39:12] this man came to fix your health care this man came to make america great again so did these guys this man came to build back better even
[39:36] the people that are on our side are using lies to explain lies we just don't know how deep it goes
[39:49] or if we do we're not willing to to change our appetite these men are here to save you from the fraud of covet and joe rogan tests his guests every day
[40:06] these guys are are your saviors these guys are the ones that have been presented to you as well these guys can tell you what's going on with kovid this man is here to expose the truth of 9 11 by telling you saudi arabia was
[40:22] behind it those of you who don't know julian assange said i'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9 11.

<h2>Chapter 6. Skepticism and Emotional Attachments</h2><p>Skepticism, though often associated with a rational and critical approach to information, can also be deeply intertwined with emotional attachments and personal beliefs. This complex interplay between skepticism and emotional responses influences how individuals perceive and interact with information, particularly in contentious or polarizing subjects.</p><h3>6.1. Challenges of Skepticism</h3><h4>Struggle with Deeply Ingrained Beliefs</h4><ul><li>Even among those who identify as skeptics, challenging deeply ingrained beliefs can be a formidable task. Emotions, personal experiences, and social influences can create cognitive biases that reinforce existing beliefs, making it challenging to objectively evaluate new information.</li><li>In cases where skepticism conflicts with deeply held beliefs, individuals may experience cognitive dissonance, leading to psychological discomfort and a reluctance to accept contradictory evidence.</li></ul><h5>Grounds:</h5><ul><li>Psychological studies have demonstrated the phenomenon of motivated reasoning, wherein individuals selectively interpret and evaluate information in a manner that aligns with their preexisting beliefs and preferences.</li><li>Neuroscientific research indicates that emotional responses play a significant role in decision-making and belief formation, suggesting that skepticism is not purely a rational process but is influenced by emotional factors as well.</li></ul><h4>Emotional Attachments to Beliefs</h4><ul><li>Emotional attachments to beliefs can further complicate the process of skepticism, as individuals may perceive challenges to their beliefs as personal attacks or threats to their identity. This emotional investment can lead to defensive responses and a reluctance to engage with opposing viewpoints.</li><li>Social dynamics within communities of like-minded individuals can reinforce emotional attachments to beliefs, creating echo chambers where dissenting opinions are marginalized or dismissed outright.</li></ul><h5>Grounds:</h5><ul><li>Studies on group dynamics and social identity theory indicate that individuals derive a sense of belonging and validation from membership in groups that share their beliefs and values, fostering emotional attachments to group norms and ideologies.</li><li>The phenomenon of cognitive dissonance suggests that individuals may experience psychological discomfort when confronted with information that contradicts their beliefs, leading to defensive reactions and attempts to rationalize or justify their existing beliefs.</li></ul><h3>Warrants:</h3><ul><li>By acknowledging the emotional dimensions of skepticism and the challenges posed by deeply ingrained beliefs, we gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between rationality and emotion in belief formation and evaluation.</li><li>Through an exploration of the psychological and social factors that influence skepticism, we can develop strategies to foster more open-minded and constructive discourse, grounded in evidence-based reasoning and empathy for diverse perspectives.</li></ul>

<h3>Chapter 8. Understanding Cognitive Biases in Decision Making</h3><p>In the realm of decision-making, cognitive biases wield a significant influence, often leading individuals astray from rationality and objectivity. These inherent mental shortcuts and predispositions affect how we perceive information, interpret data, and ultimately make judgments. Recognizing and understanding these cognitive biases is paramount for fostering sound decision-making processes.</p><h4>The Influence of Confirmation Bias</h4><ul><li>Confirmation bias, one of the most prevalent cognitive biases, involves the tendency to seek out information that confirms preexisting beliefs or hypotheses while disregarding evidence to the contrary. This bias reinforces existing viewpoints and inhibits critical thinking and open-mindedness.</li><li>Individuals succumb to confirmation bias when selectively exposing themselves to information sources that align with their opinions, surrounding themselves with like-minded individuals, or interpreting ambiguous evidence in a manner consistent with their beliefs.</li><li>Confirmation bias can have far-reaching implications in various domains, including politics, science, and personal relationships, leading to polarization, misinformation, and the perpetuation of false beliefs.</li></ul><h5>Grounds:</h5><ul><li>Psychological studies have consistently demonstrated the pervasive nature of confirmation bias across different demographic groups and cultural contexts.</li><li>Real-world examples, such as echo chambers on social media platforms and the spread of conspiracy theories, underscore the detrimental effects of confirmation bias on decision-making and societal discourse.</li></ul><h4>Anchoring Bias and Its Effects</h4><ul><li>Anchoring bias occurs when individuals rely too heavily on initial pieces of information (the "anchor") when making subsequent judgments or estimations, even when the anchor is irrelevant or misleading. This cognitive shortcut can lead to systematic errors in decision-making.</li><li>Anchoring bias manifests in various contexts, from negotiations and financial markets to medical diagnoses and hiring decisions. Once an anchor is established, subsequent judgments tend to cluster around it, regardless of its validity or relevance.</li><li>Awareness of anchoring bias is crucial for mitigating its effects, as it empowers individuals to critically evaluate the information they encounter and refrain from being unduly influenced by arbitrary reference points.</li></ul><h5>Grounds:</h5><ul><li>Experimental studies have demonstrated the robustness of anchoring bias across diverse populations and experimental settings, highlighting its universal applicability.</li><li>Observational research in real-world settings, such as pricing strategies in retail environments and courtroom decisions, provides further evidence of the pervasive influence of anchoring bias on decision-making outcomes.</li></ul><h3>Warrants:</h3><ul><li>By acknowledging the existence of cognitive biases and their impact on decision-making processes, individuals can adopt strategies to mitigate their effects and foster more rational and objective judgments.</li><li>Incorporating principles of critical thinking, skepticism, and evidence-based reasoning into educational curricula and organizational training programs can equip individuals with the tools necessary to navigate cognitive biases effectively.</li><li>Promoting a culture of intellectual humility, curiosity, and intellectual diversity is essential for fostering an environment conducive to open-minded inquiry and constructive dialogue, ultimately leading to more informed and equitable decision-making outcomes.</li></ul>

[01:24] um true [Music]
[02:20] um [Music]
[02:34] is [Music] [Music]
[02:52] [Music] james true here i'm assuming you can hear my voice we're about to get started here
[03:18] a little bit of technical difficulties this morning but we're uh happy to do a reset time to flip that circuit um good morning good morning i am john the baptist here today
[03:30] and uh uh if you don't know you probably know what that means but maybe you don't uh do was kind of kind of unkempt right he was kind of sloppy in certain ways and
[03:42] um and if you guys can hear my audio it'd be great to let me know um i bet someone just did hopefully oh great can hear me uh yesterday last night uh for some of you today
[03:57] at 11 30 last night for me the solstice uh began a uh a big shift as you're about to see and i don't know how many of you
[04:09] knew that the solstice was um john the baptist's birthday or or the celebrated um thank you thank you melanie uh the
[04:23] celebrated uh birthday um and we're gonna talk about it today because it's pretty profound if you don't know john the baptist um
[04:38] there's there's some few hallmarks to this um one of which is john was uh a little bit on the uh eccentric side
[04:52] he would be what you would call a uh a truth or maybe five years ago like uh you could equate him with like a legit alex jones
[05:03] um uh i'm using legit here because you're about to see as we dive into this topic fanaticism is its own form of truth
[05:16] and john the baptist was really really really really serious about truth the same way you were last summer the same way you are right now the same way you've been all winter all through coped that each of us have
[05:32] been this john the baptist type icon matthew 3 4 john wore clothes made of camel's hair he had a leather strap around his waist and ate grasshoppers and wild honey certainly some will
[05:46] dispute that claiming it wasn't grasshoppers those were very good he was eating something even worse and and that is exactly the proof that i'm have for you today about the story of john the baptist the scaffolding
[06:03] and the solstice of john the baptist this is a scaffolding archetypal figure when i see scaffolding i mean behind the scenes behind the set behind the stage behind the curtain there is a intricate
[06:19] system of scaffolding holding the sets in place holding uh the entire show together and that scaffolding is
[06:32] um it's winking at you it's winking at you all the time and we are in an age where we were brought we were delivered we were chosen as the avatar of our dna line
[06:48] to be on the forefront of that your entire adrenal system is here to witness this rapture and you've been witnessing it you've been witnessing it this whole time
[07:03] this 11-11 mitosis in society which side do you drink from where is the nectar of your baptism the solstice
[07:23] is a big deal it was so big of a deal that that a human figure emerged out of the scaffolding he you could say that he was wrong you could say he was breathed into the
[07:37] clay you could say that your belief itself shaped him out of the very ether it doesn't matter because syncretism shows you that there's more than one truth
[07:51] and the solstice is the birthday the celebration of john the baptist and this was a man who suffered for the truth i baptized you with water for repentance but after me comes one who is more
[08:06] powerful than i says matthew 3 1 33 11 john the baptist is telling you i'm not worthy i'm not worthy i'm not worthy
[08:17] but the lamb is the one who comes is and that i am only the pointer to it this is key and the pointer to the lamb and john's ego was based on
[08:35] self-deprecation his faith his dedication was based on how much conviction he could pull from the crowd that there is a technology of conviction
[08:51] and it's been here since day one and that you will measure someone's truth by the amount of conviction you feel secreted from them and that conviction
[09:02] is a sound that conviction is a frequency some of you are aware that that conviction is a smell because smell itself is a nuclear
[09:16] conviction that's flying around the ether that the the power of something is so strong you can charge the freaking ether with your conviction
[09:30] and what causes us to believe what causes us to believe in things is not truth so much as that feeling we get being close
[09:45] to someone's conviction that the person who has conviction is providing an umbrella for you in the shittiest of times and that conviction doesn't have to be right it doesn't have to be good news
[10:02] none of those are required for you to find comfort that's why i've been saying for so long because it's something that i learned so hard that the truth movement itself the same movement john baptist
[10:15] was on has always been a comfort movement and that's not a bad thing it's not it's showing you the entire reason why you're here
[10:26] it's showing you the entire technology behind conviction and self-deprecation and we look around today this saturday was june 9th juneteenth a new holiday a
[10:41] completely fabricated corporate holiday based around suffering based around the sainthood of suffering there are 44 verses in the
[10:53] bible referencing sackcloth and six referencing covering one cells in in ashes there's an entire cult when i say cold there's an entire system of belief out there is a better way to
[11:08] put it who will take the ashes of their family and mourn by covering themselves in them to tar and feather thyself is a form of conviction colossians
[11:22] colossians 1 24 in my flesh i complete what is lacking in christ afflictions for the sake of his body that is the church 1 corinthians 9 2 7 i chastise my body and bring it into subjection
[11:36] least perhaps when i have preached to others i myself should be cast away and that through the history of of worship through the known history of worship i should say
[11:52] man has secreted conviction from himself secreted truth from himself the messianic movement is the secretion of truth through pain
[12:07] jesus on the cross could not be a clearer symbol of that i don't want to hear you argue with me about it the suffering is the secretion the suffering is the liberation and the truth
[12:21] and why is it true not because it's true although it could be i'm not saying it's not but listen to me why is it true because of the power of the conviction simple thermodynamic magical equation
[12:38] who of us is willing to die for the belief that one of us is evil and the other is good that is a standard argument on the
[12:51] battlefield in every war and who wins that battle every time is the man with more conviction not who's right at no point does the universe stop and say wait a minute look that's a nazi over
[13:06] there and we can't have him shoot you because you're you're an american and you're you're the good guy you're so good and he's so bad so i'm gonna change the space-time continuum here and make that bullet
[13:20] uh turn around and go back to from whence it came out out damn spot right because your truth it doesn't work that way it's conviction and conviction is such a deeper form of truth that your neocortex can never
[13:35] touch it ever ever ever can get to the heart of where your conviction is and it's okay please don't argue with me about this because you're arguing with your own reptile you're arguing with that
[13:48] center portion of your brain that simply lives in a system where survival is truth that's all and this is not about how evil you are in fact it's the opposite because to survive
[14:02] is to be good we can talk about that word later but to survive is to be good that that system that law has been in nature from day one and none
[14:16] of you are going to tell me that flowers are evil none of you are going to tell me
[14:25] that whales are somehow immoral morality is a frequency and it resounds its way from the very bottom to the very top and as you gain and lose
[14:41] electricity your morality changes too and the only thing no matter where you are on that spectrum if you're all the way down here where everyone's calling you a narcissist because you have no electricity if you're all the way up here where everyone's calling you a saint because
[14:55] you have so much electricity the truth will only come not from your truthiness but from your conviction and that conviction is about sacrifice and the kabbalists knew that
[15:09] john the baptist knew that you're dealing with a time a pre-roman time where people did not have jobs everyone was self-employed
[15:23] and they were employed in the business of survival and that business of survival does not involve truth it involves something much more expensive than that
[15:39] psalm 35 13. ego autumn kumihi molesti isant in dubar celicio i'm sure i bastarded i bastardized that it's the first mention of the selecio
[15:53] celicio is basically a device that's used to bring pain to the individual and that pain is supposed to be a reminder
[16:06] of their sacrifice of their purpose but deep down that pain is something deeper deep down that pain is proof of conviction
[16:20] and it's constantly paying into the trauma technology these are examples of hair shirts used throughout um the world throughout history in fact
[16:36] john the baptist would have would have worn something like this made out of camel hair turned inside out the flailing the flatulation all of these are placing ourselves on the same cross to secrete
[16:50] the same kind of conviction and this conviction is not words this conviction is so much more expensive than tongue
[17:06] in the story of elijah and they cried out and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances until the blood gushed out upon them and as midday passed they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation and there was no voice
[17:20] no one answered no one paid attention one kings eighteen elijah in that story was showing you the history of the time that the worshipers in this case it was
[17:38] uh baal mulaq that the worshipers of baal mulaq would utilize self-cutting as part of their belief
[17:50] that by showing their conviction to god they cause him to act in the world it's the ashura festival it's the same rituals
[18:12] it's proof of conviction and it's also a much deeper prana economy i'd like for you to notice that the person on the right is probably pretty focused on the person on the left
[18:30] and that the person on the left is helping the person on the right beat himself even more it's a frequency this man in the center covered in blood has found a frequency that emits conviction and it's so
[18:47] powerful a circle a human circle has formed organically around him and he is king he has crowned himself king and he's
[19:02] earned it because he believes he believes that he's entitled to it and what gave him that entitlement was it because he woke up that morning and thought you know i'm just a good guy
[19:17] or was it because he was willing to demonstrate his conviction before a witness and that witness was willing to pay him by their belief too saint bartholomew was skinned alive and
[19:40] beheaded it's often depicted holding a flailed skin or the curved flinting knife with which he was skinned he's called the patron saint of leather makers
[19:53] he was sainted for flailing his own skin off our old friend ezekiel poor guy really really wanted conviction was willing to take conviction farther than john the baptist farther
[20:15] than than anybody ezekiel 4 12 eat the food as you would a loaf of barley bread says lord bake it in the sight of the people
[20:26] using human excrement for fuel ezekiel appeals to the lord oh lord i don't want to eat bread cooked on human poop i i've been a vegetarian my whole life
[20:47] i've lived a clean life i've never diddled myself i've never stolen or spoken your name in vain is there is there anything you can do and the lord shows his compassion on ezekiel
[21:01] it says very well i will let you bake your bread over cow dung instead of human excrement says lord ezekiel 4 15. ezekiel is so deep in his conviction he is so deep in that technology
[21:21] that even he is not able to set his sights on the golden prize of bread cooked by human excrement and he would have to have to give himself a break
[21:37] but only through divine providence and eat that over cow dung instead this is technology guys and this technology was rampant on the land that what you consider companies competing right now what you consider
[21:54] a gold label record what you consider a top 10 video you're looking at the same technology and conviction in worship and conviction that people were [Music]
[22:06] sold on which saint had more conviction ezekiel was competing this is the lance armstrong
[22:21] of rome each of them were competing and each of them were willing to take it as far as it it needed to go the mad magdaramay festival in the philippines
[22:43] this still goes on today the uh if you're wondering about the blindfold i think that has to do with martyring i think people are realizing that when they're beating themselves in public and people can see you people can recognize you
[23:03] that you're not martyring yourself you're you're pulling sympathy these are very very different things and so you'll see that a lot of these rituals involve hiding the face see why because as i just explained
[23:17] this guy is king this has nothing to do with the lord because the prana economy gives him all the credit his face is the sigil that gets the charge
[23:35] story gets the charge saying bartholomew his details get the charge well [ __ ] he must be right because look he had this whole conversation with god about it and even these people are still
[23:49] recognized in their town people know who this is a severe beating can knock all the evil out of you proverbs 20 30. second samuel 3 31 show your sorrow by tearing your
[24:04] clothes and wearing sackcloth shiite muslims very very very serious children of abraham yep have this same ritual the flagellation done in public breeds trauma
[24:25] it's a trauma bonding event with tribe and that tribe shows you who you can trust believe it or not these are good events they're the same events we have right now a corporate ritual flagellation is is uh you're going to
[24:40] have to get a you're going to have to get a vaccine if you want to participate if you want to keep working if you want to run with the big boys you can't be coming in here saying you
[24:55] were afraid of a vaccine it doesn't take much for a simple electricity it doesn't take much to influence and the truth is the lord's been using the same thing that the lord technology of the old
[25:13] testament was a capitalizing on this type of mutilation saul replied say to david the king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred philistine
[25:24] foreskins to take revenge on his enemies that the same techniques that you saw in the pied piper of war where they're telling people hey man if you go ahead and list now at least you'll get a bonus
[25:40] the same things were being done way back then with circumcision that people were voluntarily doing something to prevent just like a vaccine to prevent something
[25:54] from happening in the future it's all based on belief all of it is based on belief the old testament made circumcision a trauma monopoly when i say monopoly i want you to notice
[26:15] that genesis 17 every male among you shall be circumcised it will be the sign of the covenant between you and god but in the exact same books in the exact same scripture do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on
[26:28] yourselves leviticus 19 28 and ezekiel 44 after the chapters of burning your own bread on human excrement no foreigners uncircumcised in heart and
[26:41] flesh as to enter my sanctuary requiring the very same circumcision that he forbids like so many apostles back then like so
[26:54] many saints like so many people trying to survive in rome masochism was self-employment masochism was something that you could participate in
[27:09] with something that society itself pushed on you victim psychology erupted from salvation victim psychology is the slow secretion of all of us
[27:28] still wanting to secrete truth and we will secrete that by the subtlest of victimhood the word martyred never meant
[27:41] dead person for god martyr used to mean witness testimony at first that term applied to the apostles but it turned out that so many people like this
[28:00] this the fact that the apostles were suffering that they began to use that word to that martyr became a commonplace became normalized and what do you see right now the same
[28:14] things and then they they put a threshold on it they said all right from now on unless you've died you can't be a martyr doesn't matter how much you suffer you have to die
[28:30] and the eugenics program began martyrdom has two ingredients two requires suffering and it requires witness i'm going to play this because i want you to see that it's the exact same
[28:44] screams it's the exact same calls it's the exact same cries but they could only be done in the city of rome [Music] for it to work that this is an antenna this is a collector this is a spine
[28:57] collecting things by showcasing suffering this is the ish ashura festival but for pansies like this this but for women
[29:39] did you know this person is from russia this person doesn't even live in america but they had the camera they had the witness they had the collector and the opportunity to martyr and i'm not i'm not saying this is wrong i i
[29:58] wish that we would stop pretending that we can know [ __ ] and that we just understand how belief works because it's belief drives every industry not science it's belief belief drives every government every war
[30:12] every politic we're all pretending well it's because we don't know [ __ ] no no we know plenty what we don't admit is how much belief affects us is how important belief is and instead of denying that why don't we start saying hey
[30:26] maybe that's more important than it should be maybe we should stop considering this false notion of gnosis because every frequency has a different belief because every frequency has a
[30:39] different place where one can gather to find comfort and we seek comfort as much as we seek truth what do you think causes the sine wave of your life is your constant constant
[30:53] struggle between which one you like more do i want to be comfortable or do i want the truth do i want to be comfortable or do i want the truth and that's the whole reason that keeps you moving and movement is life it's the verb it's
[31:08] the sine wave saint ludvik of ashes not only is this the dirtiest man in europe who made the news a few years ago but he's the most famous he became a popular tourist destination
[31:22] until he finally died he kept an internal fire burning in his house so he could lay in the ashes all the time it gave him comfort and why did he give him comfort because so many witnessed him
[31:39] so many people witnessed him it secreted the conviction necessary to allow him to survive martyrs are measured in witness this witness is measured in ams greta has 4.9 million amps
[32:02] hog boy has 1.1 million amps these are the same martyrs that we had back then it's exact same technology even the covering of the ashes
[32:22] these are actually actors extinction rebellion is a hired acting coalition it's a coalition of sag actors that are professional activists
[32:41] and if you look at the one on the right you see this woman's happy this brings her joy pretending to be covered in ashes having all these pictures taken of her
[32:53] is good to her it's a collection in her in the background here is september 11th those people aren't happy those people are secreting more conviction because they're authentic the pharisees and the
[33:17] sad douches i like to call them the sad douches they saw this entire thing happening they saw the fanaticism running rampant these were the protectors of the book of
[33:29] moses we're constantly saying don't be worshipping no false idols you dumbasses stop doing that stop doing that don't make any images don't do this don't do that cut your dick off though but don't do anything else don't don't
[33:44] cut your tattoos don't don't do anything else except for trend the type of your dick an entire economy was born with the price of sainthood
[33:59] andrew was tied to a tree and scourged agnes was brotheled yes brotheled sent to a brothel poured out burned sword in the throat bartholomew scanned alive
[34:12] catherine broken on the wheel burnt clement tied to anchor casting the sea dymphna beheaded by her own father yulia tortured in 13 ways hippolytus torn apart by wild horses al
[34:28] ignacius eaten by lions james stone clubbed i don't mean stoned and clubbed in the good ways jesus humiliated tortured crucified jerome flailed john scalped and eaten alive lawrence roasted alive
[34:42] mathias burned alive matthew martyred stabbed paul martyred beheaded peter crucified upside down then cut in half philip crucified focus thrown into kiln boiled alive some furosa
[34:57] children murdered in front of her then drowned thomas martyred by four spears victor ground to death in a stone mill the price of sainthood is of course
[35:12] death but it's also the deepest form of suffering why because that suffering can be credited as conviction and truth that's why
[35:28] that's why and that all those things are equated as truth because of the amount of suffering that endured i had to say all these things
[35:46] because let's see if he gets it yeah good job buddy i had to say all these things because i'm about to tell you about baptism but before i tell you about baptism i
[35:59] i really need you to picture perfectly the kind of world that existed then that the cooking of of excrement
[36:12] that the um the the public displays right now sometimes you will see uh someone on the interstate with a sign telling you
[36:26] that they're homeless and that i want you to picture that that was uh built into the population but it was it was a professional sport

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
36:40] that even sofa street itself came out of that same same pool but that was an industry it was an industry it was such an industry that the stories
[36:54] of demons that jesus tells you in the bible are literally the stories of him watching someone possessed by this industry of victimhood of martyrdom and that people were so
[37:08] intensely looking for a way out that they were willing to flail their own skin they were willing to shove spears under their fingernails they were willing to circumcise themselves in an alleyway
[37:21] to prove their manhood they were willing to take it as far as it needed to go so they could survive and then john the baptist didn't stop with putting a hair shirt on
[37:40] not only that john the baptist was popular that the pharisees and the douche the sadduces deuces douches were watching him they would ask him questions they would
[37:55] they would go to him he wouldn't come to them they would go to him because of the conviction that this guy had going and if you're going to tell me that that much conviction can come from
[38:07] a simple hair shirt turned inside out i'm going to tell you you're wrong i'm going to tell you that john had a medicine that was much more intense than flailing much more intense than a
[38:22] hair shirt john had the technology of drowning waterboarding is a simulated drowning in a controlled environment
[38:39] the individual is mobilized on his or her back inclined downward cloth is placed over the individual's mouth water is poured over the face the water poured over the subject's face forces the imposition of water into the lungs eliciting a gag reflex the subject
[38:53] believes they are drowning and the death is imminent believes they are drowning numerous experts have described this technique as torture mess reportedly causes mental distress without causing
[39:06] lasting physical damage to the subject mouth and sinuses filled with water inclined keeps water level below lungs preventing drowning breathing becomes labored and subject panics he panics
[39:23] and as he's panicking that trigger we've talked about in the eye of raw that trigger your inside your epiphysis and your epiphysis
[39:37] chamber inside your pineal is a suicide trigger and that constantly there is a secretion of chemicals that are here to dissolve you completely as a person completely obliterate you to send you to
[39:51] the machine elves as mckenna might say to be completely obliterated to die is to have this trigger released because all the dmt that's flowing out of your system through your pineal is now
[40:03] inhibited by chemicals and that what's happening inside your body all the time is that this suicide trigger is waiting for you to take your thumb off and that you would only take your thumb
[40:18] off when the situation is so dire that you think you were about to die and because of that by releasing the thumb the dmt is able to render yourself in one final moment which is this flash of light we see
[40:32] it is to render your life before your eyes which is an experience that has more conviction than flailing myself and torturing
[40:46] yourself than even eating bread cooked in poo that drowning is a higher form of that technology
[40:58] and the baptism performed on the water was john's ancient technology of finding god and that now we see a
[41:14] superficial form of that the same way you see the russian lady screaming about donald trump we see that in our baptisms we even symbolically cross our arms
[41:28] knowing that we're about to die and that baptism took several men it took several men why because you were holding a human underwater
[41:44] you were holding him underwater until he thought he was going to die and that takes strength and that draws a crowd i would like for you to picture why they would leave the nice
[41:58] climate-controlled temple to come down to the jordan river and go what the hell is the crazy dude who eats bugs doing there are hundreds of people there why are they there they were there because john was
[42:15] providing you with a near-death experience and when you die you're said to see and go for the light there was a man sent from god whose name was john he came as a witness to testify
[42:29] concerning that light so that through him all might believe he himself was not the light he came only as a witness to the light john was the witness for those
[42:44] who wanted to seek the light for those who wanted the experience a near-death experience is a profound personal experience associated with death or impending death with researchers claim
[43:01] share similar characteristics when positive such experiences may encompass a variety of sensations including detachment from the body feelings of levitation total serenity security warmth the experience of absolute dissolution
[43:15] what is baptism and the presence of a light the presence of a light the exact same experience when
[43:27] negative offers anguish and distress so the same experience can be good and bad
[43:39] right it can be a bad experience or it can be a happy experience either way the flesh is transcended and around here transcending the flesh
[44:02] equals conviction we've never understood that but it does the truth is is that christ put an end to john's suffering by fulfilling his role as messiah
[44:19] and i want to tell you more about that right now but my team we have so guys this is going to be a nice series because this is just today's just about john the baptist but i want you to take this
[44:35] trauma technology that we're talking about and i want you to carry it with you next time when we talk about christ but before we do we need to look at the solstice it's very important
[44:52] [Music] keep in mind that the christ was exercising the same martyr technology that we've just described and that christ was used to purge out therefore the old leaven
[45:11] that ye may be a new lump as year unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us and that the same people that were protecting the old testament
[45:22] were also protecting christ even though we claim that that that this was a war between the christians and the and the romans or even the uh sad douches but you're about to see that that's not
[45:37] actually the case it's not that part of venerating a martyr is to be supporting that martyr and to get there i just want to explain real quick that there's arma christie
[45:55] the weapons of christ these are called the instruments of passion there are objects associated with the passion of jesus christ and christianity symbolism and art there seems in arms and the sense of heraldry these are the weapons
[46:08] of christ that he used to achieve his conquest over satan of course the most famous of these would be the crown of thorns the very crown that he wore was preserved by the very people
[46:23] that are claiming to never believe in christ why because they believe in the technology that when you look at all the others well jerome flailed himself but that was it well this other person she was brothel
[46:38] didn't have a sword through her throat but that was it the other way all he was crucified but then he was cut in half but that was it that alma krista
[46:49] was the ultimate mega martyr the ultimate mega the one who could not be topped because of his perfection and that there are 26 heralded instruments of the passion
[47:04] the cross of the penitent thief dismas a ladder a sponge on a reed a hammer the angels the cross of christ itself a [ __ ] who crowed in the morning right star pincers ladder spear
[47:17] cross of the wicked thief guestas two hyssop plants growing from the ground by the way those hyssoplants are also used in amethyst it's a dilator the dilator guys the very plants that are below christ
[47:30] are meant to dilate someone while they're having this ceremony ceremony ceremony and there's there's more the chalice the torch the lantern the sword the flagellum the pillars of
[47:44] flagellation ooh veronica's veil actual veil used to wipe his face as he walked 30 pieces of silver probably what a dice that we used to gamble over his clothes
[47:55] a reed scepter a hand which struck christ a torch pitcher of gall and vinegar that these are venerated as the instruments the alma christie
[48:09] of christ and why were they venerated because there are benefits to crucifixion that their three main benefactors of a crucifixion that back then what we'll call the
[48:23] church we'll call that the church the judaic uh temple leaders benefited from the crucifixion of christ that the state benefited from the crucifixion of christ
[48:37] that jesus himself benefited from the conviction from the crucifixion of christ all three of these participated in this ritual voluntarily all three of them and i know that it's a
[48:51] lot to say that and then we have to make you wait for christ but you'll see why when we get into this you'll understand why that guys your ascension
[49:04] your uh alchemy is only going to come through vitriol and that christ was an alchemist and that christ sought his own perfection and aligned himself
[49:19] with the stars and was willing to do more than anyone else was to get it that's why he was baptized by john that's why after his experience with john
[49:34] he wanted more you're looking at a vessel that could take more and so he did rome humanized the stars and called it religion
[49:50] and this benefited everyone religio is a term meaning cultist deorum like think of decorum the proper performance of rights in veneration to the gods
[50:04] cicero was the first person to even use this word i'm telling you this because i want you to understand that religion was an invention that happened in
[50:16] zero a.d was the birth of religion and the main purpose of that religion
[50:27] was to calm the [ __ ] down with the victimhood olympics that it got so bad that people were not able to focus no one felt pious anymore because
[50:42] literally during the day people were flailing themselves in the street for attention to try and prove they had more conviction and that an entire social law was formed
[50:57] and that that social law most mayoral was rome's attempt at a sweet spot between fanaticism and piety and rome never had an issue with anyone
[51:13] worshiping whatever god they wanted they supported that rome wanted you to worship somebody that was rome's only requirement and now that they had everyone
[51:27] worshiping somebody they're like but don't worship them that hard holy [ __ ] dude stop cooking your own poop ezekiel that shit's not cool
[51:40] that that's what you were seeing and that they needed a solution to this and the solution fulfilled the prophecy of stars that just like then the religion that
[51:58] ran all things was older than christ it was older than rome was older than the pyramids that the sun itself is the living embodiment of john the baptist and jesus christ john the baptist is
[52:15] said to be born six months before christ what you're looking at is the analimo on the right this is the path of the sun taken every day at a certain time
[52:32] throughout the year and at the very very top of that is john the baptist the summer solstice and the very bottom of jesus christ the winter solstice and that the sun crosses itself on its
[52:54] path from john to jesus not only does it cross itself but that sun goes underneath itself it has to die and that when it gets to john the
[53:06] baptist just like when it gets to jesus christ it will spend three days three days not moving and for three days people won't know if it's alive or dead excuse me people won't know
[53:27] that the stars were not enough hutzpah the stars itself did not have enough salaciousness to captivate people and that it became necessary to embody
[53:42] those stars into something more tangible more readable more personable to humanize which is why i say rome humanized the stars and called it religion they had to
[53:58] in fact when you're looking at baptism and resurrection you're just simply looking at the directions inside the cross that the one lesser than he the smaller of the analima
[54:15] is the baptism of the son of man and the larger enema at the bottom is the resurrection of the son of man
[54:31] and that the analima itself is the cross it's the living eternal cross and it's everywhere it's some of the most important journeys that we make
[54:50] and it's information that would take you lifetimes to even understand its living truth it has its own resonance because
[55:03] it's so big this truth of what the sun does is so big that the average person cannot go out into the sky and see it and understand this it would take him more than a year more than just the equipment necessary
[55:20] to photograph something precisely in the right spot or to even mark where it is and to have that place available all year is itself a luxury that the decoding of what actually
[55:34] happens in the sky is valuable information because it tells people when it's going to get warm again and when it's going to become cold again and that that is crucial for survival and anyone who
[55:46] knew that information was closer to god because they offered more conviction for others to gather around that conviction came from the power of the gnosis of what was physically going to happen
[55:59] next based on what's been happening for so long before and the only way the people would accept this truth is embodied inside a person
[56:15] and i believe in syncretism i believe that these people embodied themselves naturally because they were following the scaffolding of the world
[56:30] most of the saints are telling you what was happening with the sun storm jerome is reputed for having removed a thorn from the lion's paw while living as a hermit in the desert
[56:46] and if you look here you'll see that when the sun lowers itself when jesus's body comes off the cross the the nails are removed the thorn is removed
[57:04] and leo the constellation is embodied in the story the lion christ himself has the thorns removed
[57:18] and while living in the desert watch this while living in the desert jerome who was fascinated with skulls by the way jerome was fascinated with skulls has to go underneath
[57:32] underneath the bull newt aries and taurus it has to go underneath into virgo and what is the story of john of jerome but that he practiced
[57:47] mortifying his own body as he goes underneath the cross there's the lion down there and that while he was in the desert he was tempted by virgins
[58:03] so you have the lion leo you have the death the underworld the skull and you have the virgins and you have the thorns and all of them are depicted
[58:15] in saint jerome saint jerome translated the vulgate latin bible so the girl said to herod give me the head of john
[58:36] the baptist on a big plate here it had john's head cut off in the prison his head was brought in on a big plate and given to the girl she then carried it to her mother
[58:51] the head of john the baptist was decapitated and sent to virgo it rose into virgo how was it decapitated it crossed the ecliptic
[59:06] the beheading and martyrdom of john the baptist is remembered on august 29th and the analima is crossed on august 29th the john the baptist is showing you a
[59:23] story that's so important it's one of the oldest stories in time and the other side of that ecliptic the crown of thorns believe it or not on april 15th
[59:42] tax day that's when all of us are told to pay we're told to pay rome and on that very same day my friends on that very same day
[01:00:03] the fire of notre dame happened and the roof shaped like a cross fell into the center and despite the worst fire
[01:00:14] ever to exist the crown of thorns was listed as the only relic to survive and if you watch this whole psy up go down you remember if you were watching me you remember i showed you the airlifted pictures of all the saints
[01:00:28] with their heads cut off in broad daylight that the old gods were removed to make room for the new and that these were done by the pharisees and the sad douches
[01:00:46] who don't like it if you don't worship the way they want you to worship the son of man is the sun man prometheus two three it's a wide
[01:01:02] squirrel it's a very wide squirrel this story is one of many and i don't think it's wrong
[01:01:23] matthew is man aquarius mark is the lion leo luke is the bull taurus john is the eagle
[01:01:36] scorpio that these signs have been embedded in religion since day one actually since the vulgate but it doesn't mean that they're not true
[01:01:53] because a lazy mind will comprehend truth once and stop but we're in a world of syncretism we're in a world where six truths
[01:02:05] can fit like layer cake and that unless you have those six truths you're never going to be able to find more conviction because you stopped you stopped on one and that's what stops most people from
[01:02:22] looking into the truth of this that this is astro theology my friends the bible is about astro theology and that the entire thing has been a battle of astronomy versus astrology and we'll be getting into that
[01:02:44] in this series can't wait to download all this to you i've been working on this all week that's why i was gone all week there is so much more and i want to remind you that ezekiel himself
[01:03:07] said i don't have two women their faces look like this each of the four had the face of a human being and on the right side of each had the face of a lion and on the left the face of an ox
[01:03:21] is also had the face of an eagle and the theophanin the hebrew ordo fannin was probably the zodiac it was the wheel inside a wheel as ezekiel called it
[01:03:36] and then when he's showing you the four faces he's looking up in the heavens and seeing the the four uh houses scorpio taurus
[01:03:49] aquarius and leo the cross of the sky the living cross of the sky this is leonardo da vinci's final
[01:04:08] painting and it's john the baptist and he's looking right at you and he's telling you telling you
[01:04:19] about the son the solo man the sole man was baptized and resurrected on heaven's cross for eternity
[01:04:36] and that truth is embedded in every every abrahamic belief this is not just in the bible this is in the quran as you're about to see this is in the talmud this is
[01:04:51] spoken in the talmud as you're about to see so much has been hidden from us in the exodus of egypt so stick with me watch more
[01:05:05] i hope you like this one and uh yeah thanks for being here let's close this puppy out
[01:05:14] where's the outro i don't know where to go [Music] wait
[01:06:14] i was waiting for something [Music] is
[01:06:34] [Music]
