[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] hey everybody happy Friday um looks like everything's all good happy May 3 uh sorry no intro music I got some stuff
[00:13] drying in the office so I can't do technical things like that but uh I wanted to report in for Duty uh actually I wanted to talk about Jews um but you can't really say things like hey I want
[00:28] to talk about Jews so uh so I'm not going to say that I'm not going to like lead this with like hey I want to talk about Jews um that would be bad that's like old me that's like old school old school
[00:42] what I would do right so no no I I I don't want to talk about that um it is a felony in 28 states to
[00:57] boycott um a country it's the only the only thing like that out of all the special groups that have been harassed throughout history
[01:10] and there are a lot this is the only one where a a country's origin receives diplomatic immunity as a kind of reparations
[01:26] for the potential the potential potential of bigotry and so we end up paying collectively we pay into a fund a I am
[01:40] not a bigot fund and that only works because psychologically we do not like ourselves as completely as we could and so we create a victimhood
[01:54] Olympics which competes for our Collective shallow sympathy the shallow sympathy is the oldest form of pagan alms it's uh uh the
[02:09] the story of Rome is closer than you think and so the uh
[02:18] jdl uh Southern Poverty Law Center these these groups are really just Pagan Tax Collectors that have been here for a long long time and they're not actually the ones
[02:34] fooling you they are providing you meaning the collective you a public service it's kind of like garbage and they're saying that anything
[02:47] that you buy in your house that you might be ashamed of as long as you put it in a black bag and drag it to the end of the street no one will ever question
[02:57] it in fact if you murder Mur somebody a lot of people will place the parts of the person they murdered into black trash
[03:10] bags and this is our magic kind of bag of holding it it it produces most of the psychic uh blanket that we deploy when
[03:24] we're in the field and you could say that murder is like an extreme version of that but it's it's really not it's it's blatant version of that because all of us are are are using
[03:38] these bags in a same way it's to render the world that would otherwise be untenable it's one thing to see someone
[03:50] else's garbage it's quite another knowing that everyone can see yours and it puts you in a certain state and that state we're not ready for yet
[04:04] it's a state of full accountability it's it's a state of it's one of the reasons why we wear clothes I think we should keep wearing clothes I I think clothes are fun
[04:16] um I I think that until we are like way Advanced and we've tried nude beaches I I you know growing up you you have this Romance with certain ideas you
[04:31] know I think uh an an mg uh the car called an mg is one of those a carmenia is certainly another one uh any kind of air cooled engine is
[04:44] one of these things and uh certainly nude beaches are right up there with there is from a shallow perspective this sounds like the greatest idea in the world and then as as you as you get
[04:59] closer to the reality that this is happening you lack the for many of us lack the fortitude to say hey I've changed my mind I don't want to go to the new beach and the speculations fly as to why
[05:14] you suddenly don't want to go to the new beach and no matter how hard you try and explain that you value fashion and it's taken you this far that you've had to come down this journey right to realize that you do not actually like nude
[05:28] beaches it's too late because the eager Gore of peer pressure has really struck its its its its jaws into your back it's it's got your skin and there's only a few who are really able to let go of that so we end
[05:43] up having to sabotage our own destiny because we created the destiny first place because we were looking typically it's like a lack you know like oh I have
[05:56] lack I will uh you know I will renovate my office or oh I have lack I will uh buy this large object or I will go on
[06:06] this trip or I will uh do this crazy bad thing and as long as we have the black trash bag of I wasn't conscious of that or I didn't know that or you didn't tell me the rules we we really see this I I I
[06:22] think that when you watch uh body cam footage of police officers I think that the the the truer state of who we are is probably going to be our attitude
[06:35] around the all father our attitude around Authority that when we when we meet absolute Authority a shedding occurs and I believe that it's actually
[06:48] the righteousness the the the melum or malamu as I sometimes call it the the the melum sheen of the authority the righteousness of the L lion causes many
[07:02] to whimper because the whimpering is really just a an evaporation of a facade that's not necessarily going to be uh uh
[07:16] holdable in the face of righteousness so the closer we become the closer we spend time with those who were more
[07:31] righteous the less we have the privilege of bags of holding of black trash bags of Spam folders of evil incarnate of I didn't know you see this a lot in the in the
[07:46] cop footage because almost every excuse that comes from every person that's uh let's say vehicular violations the face of righteousness
[07:58] appears the person is p over and and just to illustrate this uh the female driver The Violator of of said traffic
[08:09] law uh the a good bit of the of the collective of who we are is going she would respond by saying I didn't know I didn't
[08:22] know and this this is that black trash bag and of course we have the adage of ignorance is no excuse for the law but ignorance is an excuse and when we understand the mechanics of why
[08:36] ignorance is an excuse we find just how creative we are just how powerful we are as Wizards Of Consciousness we I I we become conscious
[08:50] of things when we can fully own the responsibility of them it's kind of like attaining a driver's license or something or or learning to wield a gun you you're not ready to to pick that
[09:05] up if you're lucky you don't you don't see the consequences of it I mean if you're lucky you understand the consequences of it before you picked it up if you're unlucky you end up blowing your own face off or someone else because you don't understand the power of something that's happening and we're
[09:20] living in a world now thanks to uh electronic witness where people can have some serious repercussions in a 5-second
[09:33] video a 5-second exposure of of someone's attitude among the light of righteousness will ruin your job the The Da that I mentioned uh this
[09:45] week uh is totally going to uh she's going the chop block she's a scapegoat and she's a scapegoat for the governor and for the police department and for the mayor it's it's a tri effect a
[10:01] crucifixion and that crucifixion happened in you know roughly 12 seconds but it only happened because it was broadcast I'm telling you if that body cam footage of the da in Monroe County and you don't have to see this to
[10:16] follow what I'm talking about you really don't just anything if the body cam footage of that would not have gone public the governor and the mayor and the police department all of those people would have had more
[10:29] uh flexibility and we we tend to say that they have all the power but actually they're the ones really that that end up having the least amount of ability to
[10:43] respond it's really no different than than Hollywood Hollywood's going to have to give you a movie that you're going to watch they they don't get to tell you here's what you like to watch I I think
[10:57] that they can Pace you a little bit but it's it's it's a Monumental task to install a constellation in everyone's mind and then change
[11:09] it it's much more likely to understand the power of each constellation that's already in your mind and simply distribute trading cards that lead you along a certain path from constellation to Constellation to
[11:24] Constellation that puts you in a certain position where you're in checkmate and so you you deploy the power of distance right you set up your Bishops in the farthest corners of the
[11:38] Kingdom you set your kns among the trees to where it's not really understood as something that could ever be dangerous and this is typically what happens the da suddenly finds that they themselves are checkmated by the very system that
[11:53] they thought gave them power and now the system that gave them power is taking it away 28 states have already a long time ago said
[12:06] it's a felony to boycott Israel not all of them are felonies most of them are the State of Florida which I bitched about three years ago I I covered this I don't see a lot of other people covering it I saw no one
[12:22] in the truth M covering it I think because it required too much reading to be honest with you because in the State of Florida two years ago this should have been huge D Santos signed a bill saying that anyone who comes on any
[12:36] college campus anywhere in Florida and says anything disparagingly about Israel is committing a felony and you could be a veteran on the USS Liberty I'm a veteran of the Navy so
[12:49] this just is a I have a I feel that I have a personal connection to this because it's like might might as well uh you know 158 people I believe it was
[13:01] died because of the because of of this country and you as a veteran that survived that war that wanted to just report on what it's really like to to
[13:14] live in in off the coast of Egypt to actually see what it's like to to try and exist in in really the armpit of Saudi Arabia if you if you look at
[13:30] guys just look at the structure of the land like it's it's there's an armpit of water right there and the the essence of this rock has for centuries created a salt that just leads
[13:43] to really just some of the most brutal kinds of Crusader violence that you could imagine and that it would be impossible for you to find a good
[13:56] person that could grow out of that soil and turn their back on the very Foundation of who they are and this would go for both sides right like you it's not even fair to call them
[14:10] sides it it's if you want to truly understand what's happening you're looking at a crashing of trash bags if you really want to understand
[14:26] what's happening in Israel you need to look back at why America hates itself collectively and why it's so profitable to create a trash service which walks
[14:38] around and says hey as long as you pass these laws that make it a felony to boycott Israel then you don't have to feel bad about
[14:54] yourself ultimately that's what it really runs every single law that gets pass past as a hate crime is really a uh an ability
[15:06] to to uh kind of cheat one's own self selflove in a in a kind of a way to to gain it through through
[15:22] uh surreptitious means it probably doesn't make any sense I mean it does to me but I'm probably not explaining it right but but it is a it's a psychological thing and since we're
[15:35] never going to admit that we would go to war to psychologically feel better we end up in situations like now the same thing where you're looking at an entire nation of students that fell
[15:49] for the idea that going into quarter of a million dollars in debt is the way to get a job and now we're like let's forgive student loans and it's it's uh all those things really come about
[16:04] from the idea of um the the one who wins the oppression Olympics is the one that comes to college for free and in order to make that more profitable we need to make it 20 times more expensive for
[16:19] anyone who doesn't fit who doesn't make it to the podium on these kind of Olympics so the Jews the Jews are the gold
[16:32] medal they're the gold medal holder of the people that have won the hearts of your Collective guilt the most they're the ones that were able to create the most Politics the most stories they were
[16:47] able to submit the most articles to the New York Times pushing numbers before they even existed explaining certain things as they existed because they were capitalizing on a weakness
[16:59] that none of us wanted to fix they were providing a service an ability to drain the puss out of our guilt blisters because we just didn't want to clean our own
[17:14] wounds so I think this helps us and I think that what's happening now with the the college um the college uh protests first
[17:26] of all it it's it's definitely something that has been protested for a long time I've been protesting this for a long time the fact that it's made national news now is a factor of propaganda and
[17:41] as you know what we mean about propaganda propaganda just means what is the fuel to propagate this who pays for that fuel so when you see something make national news you know that someone with
[17:53] enough clout has has done something to stimulate the push to make this a national story there's a lot of uh suppression that happens not necessarily by a military-industrial machine although certainly that talks about it
[18:08] but that's more of our camouflage we use to cover our own suppression we only want to see stories that are anti-confederate I can I can tell you the the I can go on
[18:21] skeptical with that Alex taras guy and tell him the true history of the South and just give him the the the biography off Wikipedia of Nathan Bedford Forest and that guy says I have to pull this
[18:34] show I can't even show it to anyone and that's not because it's not factually accurate there's no at no point could Alex come up with a fact that I was wrong about his beef was that I wasn't sucking
[18:48] the dick of Frederick Douglas and it's he didn't understand that the history of Frederick Douglas is the history of Dave Crockett is the history of Daniel Boone you're watching this blur between reality which is now
[19:02] and mythology which is back then and as you go back from Daniel Boon Dave Crockett Paul bunan Troy you in Olympus you end up into this
[19:15] flux where you leave the petrification of of reality and you remove yourself back into this plasma mythology and I'm telling you this plasma mythology is just belief it's just lies it's just the lies that we tell
[19:30] ourselves so that we cannot be conscious of certain things because if we get pulled over and we Face the righteousness of authority we're going to be able to say well I didn't know I I
[19:40] didn't know I didn't know I didn't know and this is why ignorance is such a powerful white belt on the mat this is why we talk about it is a is a dojo instrument you you should the longer you
[19:56] remain ashamed of your ignorance the longer you were trying to pretend that it's not a voral weapon that you've been using to chop off heads this whole time which makes you more violent than anyone else on the mat and you're pretending to be a
[20:10] sheep and isn't that the most ninja thing you could do is to plead ignorance as you're chopping heads off to be so camouflaged from the event that you yourself are not even aware that
[20:23] you're wielding a a a voral weapon right this is plus three plus three attack in melee combat it's it's you're watching the gold
[20:38] medalist and if you want to look even back further if you doubt this and I don't even care if you doubt it but even if you look at the history of Christianity we ourselves demanded that we have a sect that we can borrow money
[20:53] from that from a long time ago we're like look we we need a a gang of dirty heathen so we can borrow money from them because user is wrong and so the entire time we've been
[21:06] looking for a kosher system of money and the irony is as we've relied on this very class that has thrived on being the bottom feeder it's the
[21:20] Undertaker of your guilt and it's created uh a world court and in this world Court Netanyahu a person who's never been opposed despite having
[21:34] 42 uh uh claimed separate parties in Israel that guy still gets elected and he says to people that are in the international Court saying hey I think we need to uh to apprehend
[21:48] Netanyahu for war crimes this just happened two days ago that he comes out publicly in front of the entire United Nations and tells pal in I will hunt you down the ones who said that you should
[22:02] that that I should go to roal court I will hunt you down personally and I will I will hold you responsible for what you've just done to me for what you've just said this is happening in real
[22:14] time and you can't be surprised because I told you about this in in uh Ecuador when we we're looking at Hillary Clinton the entire time president Trump in the middle of saving America and all
[22:28] all this other stuff and the importance of sovereignty puts out a $25 million hit on the president of Latin America of of ahead what was the country it was it was it was Honduras
[22:40] yeah M Madre sorry I I when I get back in my office I'll be able to look this up easier so yeah none of this is
[22:53] broken none of this needs fixing it's more of just kind of a a litmus of a litmus of who we are you know we don't want to see the body cam
[23:11] footage I mean we do but we we don't watch it religiously enough because we really like the illusion that all of us have our together and when we have the illusion of all of all of us have our together the only way to really Shore up that illusion is just to pass more loss
[23:25] because it it keeps giving us this idea oh well there's just another law there's just another law and right now there there is another anti-Semitism law and the only reason why those things
[23:38] make it is because we're living in a court that uses this kind of Technology it's it's the most anti-confederate thing you could have and we're living on
[23:50] Turtle Island and the oldest government that I've been able to trace back is here and it was a
[24:03] Confederacy it lasted longer than Rome 1144 the eclipse was the founding of the hoden noodi there're still here for 500 years
[24:16] they ran a successful form of government called A Confederacy and and we as a nation have the worst connotations the worst r slurs
[24:29] the worst trash bag shallow thoughts that we can possibly have about the only people who when they were here in this country in the South were integrating with the Native Americans and this same country that
[24:45] calls that says 28 States it's now a felony to be a bigot say that it's the Confederates that are bad that it's the ones that were integrating with Turtle Island are the
[24:59] enemy and the New Yorkers who were being boozed up and and bribed into putting on uniforms were the good guys if you're from New York I'm not trying to slam you down I'm just saying that back then that's really all it took it was an
[25:13] influx of Pi Piper of money of food of liquor of whiskey into a central location for six years before the war even started 6 years before it even started
[25:28] the north was mustering armies to eliminate not the not the South that you and I think we know but the Confederacy itself because of the internet because of the fact that people from other countries can now come and tell you
[25:45] about American history and they they don't even spend time here and they're going to tell you that the White House has been here forever or that everything's a reset this is actually what causes us to lose history this is actually what does
[25:59] it it's not it's not a government suppressing the history it's us just just wanting that cheap fix just wanting that quick quick bag fix to what it is look I just don't want to be a
[26:12] bigot and so we end up now we're rewriting all of our history we're dismissing all these really important things that we're missing the fact that that that global warming is the worshiping of thock the worshiping of
[26:26] this God of global disaster Master is the the Amura this entire creature that that that the the oldest
[26:38] Roots we can see at Tempo mayor is the World Health Organization and and when you look at The Laurels of of the wreath you're looking at the plume serpent itself and this is the closest you and I
[26:53] are going to be able to see a creature that spans from Horizon to Horizon it's so large that we're only going to be able to really recognize its logo it's Shadow it's blurring across the
[27:06] land and I think as long as we remain afraid of that Beast as long as we refuse to animize the truth in the room we're going to keep asking for people that's selling us these trash bags that come buy and offer us this
[27:21] service last summer uh a a popular streamer uh did a stream uh where he tried to present me as a Hitler lover his name is Andrew Wilson and he did that uh because a moderator inside
[27:36] my own group Who Loved Hitler ironically uh went to him and said hey you should you should you should try and hurt this guy James and even in the face of one of the
[27:49] worst Eugenics uh test cases that we've ever seen even in the face of some of the biggest shifts of of government me taking two steps forward and waiting 15 minutes we've watched ourselves
[28:03] cannibalize our own quest for betterment and that as long as we keep doing that we're really looking at the True Body cam footage of what we're really like this happened with 9911 with building seven we can't even I can't
[28:19] even make a point about building seven because now someone has to trumpet with well building six is there and no one knows about building six because all the real hype is at building six and so you end up missing some important stuff
[28:33] because it's not new it's not fresh most of us are are looking for the esoteric cocaine and we keep assuming that one of us has it and some of you have accused
[28:46] me of having it as if I have this kind of like secret secret wisdom and and I don't all of us have perspective and until we find that our own perspective is is strong enough we're going to look
[28:59] to others and just adopt theirs and that's fine this is a a great way to get off the Yol to find the selfness you know to create the solipsism really this
[29:12] Soul eye there's really only one eye in the universe and it's you I mean it's me but it's you there's only one eye in the universe it's the only one you can prove is you even me talking to you right now
[29:27] it's just that reminding you of this and it's a holographic transmogrified world of like a asynchronous transmogrification I I transmogrify

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
29:41] myself through your Wormhole and you do the same through me it's it's the weirdest we've ever seen and we are only able to see certain reality when we're in tandem when we're seeing each other guys I I remind you that we are surrounded by people that none of us
[29:55] know why we're here none of us have have a clue but all of us insist that we know why we're here and all of us get really angry sometimes when someone tries to suggest that maybe the reason why we're here is a different reason
[30:09] than we think and the rest of us just get high on listening to the next reason as to why we're here and so this is a party it's a rave you're at a giant Rave and you can't go home you can't go
[30:23] home look drink a lot of water find something fuzzy enjoy the textures right you're going to hear a lot of that's because people don't like silence they're not ready for silence yet you're going to find a nice cozy
[30:39] place to hide somewhere you're going to find some other friends you're going to find some people you Groove with you're going to be like hey man let's go hide yeah you're going to go hide you are you're going to build shelter you're going to build some sort of way of
[30:51] providing some Covenant some Covenant from this massive Rave that's happening because it's it's more Anarchy than we think it is it's more uh it's much more sociopathic than we think it is and the Very people that are
[31:06] insisting that they're giving you the goods right now are the are the very ones that are tearing apart the the truth because they're using the torque of you believing in them just like I do
[31:18] I'm not immune to this I'm I'm no different than you except for you're the only eye just like I'm the only eye see how that's transmogrification it's it's weird it's like sometimes the only way I
[31:31] can talk to myself is by talking to you sometimes the only way you can listen to yourself is by listening to me I think I'm probably the most out of
[31:44] touch with the things that I say I do the only reason why I tend to maybe dwell in it more is because someone might like it see it's the same black bag it's the same black bag
[31:58] yeah it is a Grand Illusion and it's Grand it is Grand I don't think that we are giving enough credit to how beautiful it is how creative we are at lying to ourselves at putting ourselves in this state of well I didn't know you
[32:12] didn't tell me that well I don't know I don't know this is this is why we're living in this hyena it's the hyena rule that says you are innocent
[32:24] until 12 other people who are not you convince you that you are guilty that's weird man that is a world of children and you know children's not the
[32:39] wrong world that is a world of people that are learning to find themselves they're learning to build the internal world you know hello big nose do I have a big nose or is you talking to someone
[32:54] else I could have a big nose I don't mind yesterday somebody called me bald I'm like oh okay is that what this is now I just was a
[33:12] head yeah better to smell you but then man I think that's why we get sick when we travel a lot of times people get sick when they travel because they they go and they smell the other people and because smell is so much more uh we're
[33:26] so much more vulnerable through our old factory that uh our immune system ends up freaking out yeah the the prices went up on College because have you if you consider why the tuition in college went up it it
[33:47] had to go up because the quality of the product went down the only it's kind of like an it's kind of like how how in Somalia the if you wanted to carry around like $1,000 you're going to need like a giant duffel bag of Somalia
[34:01] dollars to equal that and that the reason why the inflation increases is because the value of the currency itself is is is for not and so I would argue that education
[34:15] is the same I think that that you going to a place a a monastery of thought and putting in a ton of hours
[34:29] studying things that you may not even necessarily want to study I think that's a really good thing to do and frankly we've had public libraries for a while now in fact we're closing them
[34:44] down and the public library if government was real government libraries just would have been a bunch of like sofisty Booth where people like me would just uh
[34:56] meet and and try and bring up uh good topics and just lead the discourse of of making sure that everyone is considering as wide of a breach as I can and then you guys would would rate me more as
[35:10] like a DJ right it's not really a teacher the DJ isn't teaching you how to dance the DJ is giving you the opportunity to get
[35:23] down and so if we return to that model sophistry model then none of us would be paying for school all of us would be earning the academic credit that would simply come from our lips when we speak
[35:38] when we respond or when we inquire or when we ask that that would be the only measure of one's credentials is what they have to say we're not there we're we're nowhere
[35:51] there right now and quite frankly I'm we're all competing uh in the same kind of kind of way and it's it's uh it's kind it could be brutal to wake up to I
[36:05] think for me sometimes I wake up on the wrong side of that bed and I don't fully realize it like I don't realize I'm not dancing I'm I'm angry because I don't like the the song that's playing and and just like I'm telling
[36:20] you we you're not conscious of certain things so too am I not conscious of that also you know it's I'm talking to myself right it's all just talking to
[36:33] myself yeah why does the word sophistry have such a bad rap see this is to me this is a huge huge clue this is a huge clue the fact that that that's a bad
[36:46] word and even the atmology is the practice of wisdom right to attempt to professionally practice wisdom on the street it's the same thing as busking busking
[37:01] has the same bad connotation if you don't know what busking is it's someone who opens a guitar and and plays on the street and there's no obligation there's no contract and that that's considered
[37:14] vagrancy that's considered loitering when I was in Asheville to blow off steam because I worked in a newspaper I would come down onto the street on Wall Street and I would open my guitar case and I would just play
[37:27] and um I uh I remember the day that that the cops came the city council decided there were too many people playing on the street so they they passed an
[37:41] ordinance and they spent all this money they spent millions of dollars on copper or bronze life-size statues of musicians playing on the street and
[37:55] they the the the entire time as they were telling people like me you you can't play on the street they would replace me I actually got where I used to play was replaced with a giant flat iron I'm not actually kidding it's a giant Monopoly
[38:09] piece and and people run into that and they were uh yeah it's it's these things happen for a reason they happened for a
[38:24] reason and and you know that's that's kind of where we are are now the protests on the campus are not necessarily an organic uh change it's more of a temperature that's
[38:41] proving that the turkey's ready and that Zionism is just it's done I I don't think that the forces behind Zionism are done I just think that the it's like the drama of this
[38:55] being a a Zionist thing is really worn out a uh I I think the Apollo moon landing is is kind of a good proof for this
[39:08] like you're watching the brackish water mix now when when you bring up World War II veterans uh there's not a default anymore to like Oh we must homage and pay them reverence because they saved
[39:22] our lives like that that doesn't really happen now the connotation of a World War II veteran is usually someone who's not really smart I I think this is
[39:36] healthy I think that the people that were gaining The Valor and the self-worth from the decoration of this you know of the badge um I think that they were doing just what anyone else is doing just
[39:50] looking for selfworth the same way New Yorkers were that were uh you know being bribed to to March the streets with guns we're being convinced that later on by Sherman right that we have to go just
[40:04] burn the out of these Villages because these people are bad like this that doesn't take much doesn't take much it's like any drug dealer you just give a few free samples and you
[40:17] know somebody's hooked but but after a while those connotations you keep trying it's a it's a dead horse that's fogged over and over again zionism's been that for a while but I I I'm attaching it to the moonlanding because I think that
[40:31] this is the closest thing that we're seeing to a tangible truth of of what it's like to to watch an eager gor shed its skin the old Maya illusion that we landed on the moon is just not going to cut it anymore the old my illusion that
[40:44] this is professional wrestling uh people are throwing chairs at each other and it's Democrat Republican is not going to cut it anymore the old illusion that there's a central rock that God called holy base and that the people that get
[40:58] there the first and plant their flag are going to live for eternity that that these are childish games that people people aren't going to play anymore it's a lot like Kick the Can and I love Kick the Can but there was a day when my friends
[41:11] didn't want to play that anymore it was a sad day but it happened and it doesn't mean that plays over it means that there's a game that's even more immersive that's on the way
[41:26] and you've got the CL Schwab Muppet in the tunic you know he's right there you've got you've got Public Health you have a whole new whole new strain of Boogeyman that frankly is much more
[41:40] equipped than Zionism ever was to create a red light and a blue and a green light in the harbor and literally just keep people's mental sails between two
[41:53] poles and off the rocks are or you can say oh they're doing the crashman the Rocks I don't care if you want to think all this is nihilistic sure it's fine with me I'm sure that Claus has nothing
[42:06] better to do than to you know maniacally laugh as as he puts you under his thumb I mean that's that sounds like Dr Evil and we are taking our mythology from Hollywood and asking Hollywood to
[42:19] tell us what to fear and and we're doing exactly that so the very the very things that are God like Apollo Apollo we haven't gotten smarter we have musk now we haven't gotten
[42:35] smarter we're just buying that we orbit cars now we're going to buy that we have self- automated Vehicles we're going to buy that electric vehicle save the environment we're going to buy that the environment is in danger we're going to
[42:48] buy that all of us are going to die unless we centrally believe in a singular thought and we worship thock or pay our dues to I'm not a bigot today
[43:01] right this is these are the alms of Rome this is why you know Rome's real because it's still here as I said before this is reality and as you go back into the past you don't go back into a reality that
[43:15] was long ago you just slip into mythology so difficult to understand that you've been able to render this entire world I know and you can call me crazy or whatever you want to say say for
[43:27] suggesting that this is the way it works but this is the only proof you can know and there's going to be a time where you're going to pull off your visor and you're going to try and tell
[43:40] the righteousness that's staring at you why you acted this way and you're going to try and say I didn't know and it's not going to work do you know why it's not going to work
[43:52] because you have a nose because you have maybe a big nose that's why it's not going to work because you can smell the truth the whole
[44:04] time may my eye be single right from two eyes to one so simple yeah red and green uh so in Universal boating right uh typically
[44:22] when you go into Harbor the you you keep the red to starboard God I hope that's right if not someone just crashed a sailboat so it's like a it it it's like a meta language right a coloring of that and the the just the nautical the
[44:37] Admiral admiralty law things like that hey Raina good to see you sadistic imposters who get immense pleasure by hurting other people are very real and Among
[44:55] Us says Nico sadistic imposters who get imminent immense pleasure by hurting other people are very real and Among Us I don't I don't
[45:10] think that's true I think that that uh people that you were unable to compassionate are called sadistic imposters who are only here to hurt
[45:23] people because it brings them pleasure I think that is something that if we tell ourselves that we can shoot people in the face that we barely know that's what I think does it mean you shouldn't shoot anyone in the face no I think you should
[45:37] shoot people in the face you're going to find someone that that is so uncompassionate you're going to want to shoot him in the face but if you want to tell me that it's because they were born as this innate seed of evil and that
[45:50] there they were naturally placed into a a place where they get pleasure from watching you suffer I'm going to say I don't actually think that's true just simply because I know how how the Faith
[46:03] Works and so when you were giving someone else pain you would be feeling that pain too if you were truly owning that which means that you're actually not feeling pleasure so the sadistic
[46:15] impostor Nico isn't feeling pleasure they are feeling pain too so it's not actually pleasure thereafter it's pain thereafter so let's amend that sadistic and imposters who get immense pain by
[46:30] causing pain in others are very real and Among Us and now we're a little bit closer because you're looking for someone that wants to resonate the same experience that they've had probably in their past typically if you're going to
[46:44] derive what you're calling pleasure from extracting pain or feeling pain it's typically because you've felt this before and if you can repeat it you're going to return to a state where where
[46:57] something Dynamic can happen either you can go deeper or you can change your posture from revisiting that in a voluntary way this is where most of us power up we go back to DEA we go into
[47:10] the cave with Darth Vader and we chop his head off we have to go back there though we have to go back there so you still get to chop off people's heads don't worry you still get to call people evil and blame them for your problems
[47:24] okay but you don't get to say that it's because they were inherently born to extract pleasure from causing you pain that actually is not sustainable and if that's not sustainable and it's not there's no way that that's going to
[47:38] survive as like a vital necessary nutrient that's just in the soil is what I'm saying even kudu that you could argue would be the closest thing that we could call to evil is a type of Slow
[47:51] Burn in other words the kudu doesn't even survive to stay after the Kudzu clears a mountain side the kudu has nothing else to survive so it dies and now you basically have committed the
[48:05] safest forest fire in the world however kudu would be definitely be one of the most evilest sadistic plants in the same definition that we're giving now about these people right so if you
[48:18] compassionate Kudzu you understand that kudu is actually a vital part of this if you compassionate fire you would do the same it's hard to compassionate fire it's hard to compassionate kutu it's hard to compassionate pedophiles it's
[48:33] hard to compassionate CLA Schwab but it to me it's harder to compassionate the truther who's like yeah I'm going to go  kill some Confederates because those were truthers those were truthers that were doing that they were the ones that were like yeah I'll take a free gun
[48:48] and free food and free this and free that and sure yeah let's go kill the ninjas or the hot and tots or or the luciferians you don't think the confeder were just the luciferians cuz they were same thing as the racists or the
[49:02] Nazis right I'm telling you Nico and yeah I'm singling you out I don't care  man what are you going to do unsubscribe and defund me and tell everyone how evil I am or call Andrew Wilson to do another expose fine that's fine I'll survive and and sorry for even
[49:16] picking on you but truly if you catch yourself thinking that that's what exists out there what you're really doing is granting yourself permission to shoot someone in the face with shallow Witness and that just leads I think to a worse
[49:29] place and so that ends up being the very thing that created Zionism that's my opinion so what what do you do with this first of all you can ignore my opinion that's fine most people do most people hate this idea most people get so mad when I suggest to them that evil is not
[49:44] what we think it is it it removes their ability to use a spam filter and quite frankly they don't want that who's going to survive like that in a way I'm I'm telling you you can't have earplugs when you're listening to music or at least that's what it sounds like I'm saying
[49:58] I'm telling you that instead of ignoring the bad song you can actually find a way to enjoy it that's all I'm saying that's all compassion is doing and yeah you still get to shoot the DJ in the face you can shoot the DJ in the face you can do that you can kill anyone in this
[50:13] world you want and you know what when I went on Twitter as a truther and I was first learning this and I was all convinced that everyone was evil that there or that there was these secret group of people that were evil and that they were
[50:25] doing this and that they were doing that it suddenly occurred to me that if I called everyone's Bluff and I did and I said hey guys if we know that John podesta is really this way of course we know it what do you mean if of course we
[50:38] know it then my question is why don't we just collect him and kill him if John podesta did all these evil things this is a hypothetical YouTube algorithm holy but if John podesta did all these things that we believe
[50:53] that he did then it would be a morally good decision in a defunct government to go and put the law into our own hands so why don't we why is it that so many truthers insist on sticking on Twitter and just talking more and more and more
[51:07] about how evil John podesta is why is that and I think the reason why is because we do not fully uh we are not ready fully to understand who we are how we function and how all this works and just how
[51:23] important it is that we blackb that we blackag each everybody if I was running this country and I was in charge of like moral uh moral
[51:36] continuity I think I would realize that I would have to set up a plank somewhere and I would have to have people walking that plank at least every full moon and I would declare a sort of informal lueia
[51:49] where I would have an Epstein or a guad canal diary or a Vietnam or some sort of uh uh uh Osama Bin Laden or some sort of of figure that would allow me to
[52:02] exercise the people through the uh transmogrification of a crucifixion of an archetype and that that by doing that you're able to quch uh a good bit of violence but even more importantly if you start to do this
[52:18] for hundreds of years for thousands of years you get to do what the Ury Confederacy did they said you know Taho is not going away the people that we want to shoot in
[52:31] the face are not going away let's do something different they created the uh probably the best solution you could you could have for that the Fletcher Memorial Home for incurable tyrants and
[52:47] Kings is what they did and through one one simple rule by by declaring unanimous government unanimous consent they rendered Taho completely
[53:00] impotent they took away all of that power and ultimately what ended the longest government that ever survived was that was a switching from unanimous government into majority rule
[53:14] because the moment you enter majority rule now the Egor is the one in charge and the eor should be in charge because we do not own ourselves yet we are still convinced
[53:27] that there is a skategoat that resolves us of our own problems we could make the government
[53:39] impotent right now we could have done it 15 16 17 19 days ago and every year more and more than of us do but it takes a long time takes a long time is Nico mad at me are you guys
[53:56] guys mad at me now um okay someone's timed out so someone might be mad there is a purge there are plenty of people that don't have family speaking Twitter what's with the
[54:14] uh oh good Nico great thank you Nico thanks for letting me use you as an example I appreciate that because you know well I hope you know that this it's it's a broad it's a broad way of thinking you guys are saying a lot there's too
[54:36] much for me to read this some good stuff oh look at that Adam Weber true evil is the love of evil ignorance doing evil is just diet evil light so evil would in my opinion evil would be
[54:52] decrepit so something that's unsustainable would be evil so something doesn't have to be consciously trying to hurt you it's just just just just you know just try it on it's sophistry right it's just a song
[55:05] I'm busking on the street right now but just just try this on for a sec evil is not a conscious so so to be conscious in in the the wrong way to think about evil in my opinion is that is that there's a
[55:17] conscious intent to to be evil and this is why evil exists in the world because we've straw maned into this and if you think about it that's oxymoron because if you were to be conscious of being evil I don't think that you could actually be evil I don't think that's
[55:32] possible and I think this is where we misunderstand ourselves because we do not trust our own Hardware I I don't think that we're inherently good because I believe we're inherently good I think I think people treat me awful here I've
[55:45] had an awful experience here from most of the people in the world I I get some of the shittiest comments every day so just so you know none of this is from a unicorn perspective I I'm in pain right now from a surgery I had 15 years ago it

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
55:59] burns like a okay so just so you know I'm not like having a good time here I I genuinely think this simply because I I look at Anatomy I there's just so many chemicals that flow when you think that you were
[56:14] doing good so if you really in my opinion I don't think it's possible to be that version of evil the Disney version of evil and to be conscious of it at the same time
[56:26] the the old atmology of evil simply just meant decrepit or something that's unsustainable which meant feeble feeble evil evil feeble these are really closer to the now I'm not saying that because that's the old definition therefore
[56:42] that's what it means I just want you to carry this out a little bit and think about it because if we come from a world where we're constantly crucifying ourselves or cutting off the edges of our dicks or or whatever kind of penance
[56:54] that we need to do uh boycotting uh making it a felony in 28 countries to boycott right uh uh insisting that everyone needs to take sensitivity training because apparently when all of us see someone that has a
[57:07] different color skin apparently we turn into uh mad Riot as bigots and this is exactly what we complained about the south when the South was the ones integrating so we clearly have a Schism where we do not trust
[57:21] ourselves and I think it's healthy that we don't trust ourselves because quite frankly look at the way we behave so I think we know ourselves right on we're very conscious about that so let's let's come back to evil because the the idea
[57:34] that I'm putting forward is is that evil would only be an unconscious thing to consciously try and hold evil at its truest state would be to decrepitate yourself too you you would
[57:47] only be able to emanate evil if you were the evil incarnate to be evil incarnate is to Kudzu yourself out of existence if some of you don't know what kudu is it's a kind of Ivy that's grows like an inch
[57:59] a day in the South it covers uh telephone poles it looks like these ghosts moving it's some of the most beautiful stuff you've ever imagined but it it covers everything and you could look at that
[58:15] just like you could look at a fire just like you could look at a tsunami just like you could look at an earthquake a volcano a pedophile or uh a giant government that
[58:27] just constantly constantly murders people around the world and just says and all of those are going to be generated and run by people that think they are
[58:45] good and that the reason why they're doing it is because they feel that they're good Saddam Hussein you guys you want to
[58:58] I I think that the mentality of Iraq is very similar to the mentality of Egypt and that in order for you to have a conglomerate that's large enough to call itself a
[59:14] country you are going to need a law enforcement there that is just downright brutal as that has a its main weapon is fear
[59:26] because fear is a first grade form of Education right and it's necessary if your students are not intimidated if they do not feel their repercussions the same thing with your employees if your employees feel like they can just get away with stuff they're they're going to
[59:42] they're going to infract the evil eye that we feared for for millennium has always been the idea of someone watching us all the time
[59:57] being a kind of torture because we would not be able to maintain that kind of pressure under righteousness the righteousness of the allseeing eye is The Power Of Consciousness coming online
[01:00:10] and until you have enough fear that pushes people online you're never going to get anywhere so you usually end up with some sort of con ship right a kingship that is employing uh some kind
[01:00:22] of tactic like this first grade fear empathy is definitely a vital part of first world psychological operations and you're watching that now
[01:00:38] where everyone's freaked out about being perceived as as not liking Jews I can't think of any okay so that just sounds wrong but I I put a lot of thought into into Jewish literature here on this
[01:00:52] channel more than most I think I'm one of the few people that that really put so much effort into trying to correct the record on what the talmud actually was versus this carmalized idea of of what it's like to
[01:01:06] strawman the talmud into this and you know people are like well the talmud's a book written by evil people it's like it was wasn't even a book guys so if you don't even know that the talmid was not actually a book you're already doing the shallow phone
[01:01:20] in you're already calling that in because you spammed someone as evil and it makes it easier because now the world's solvable because hey you every you've done everything right it's just the freaking Jews that is such a
[01:01:32] profitable thing to have and if we do not have this Disney concept of evil of a conscious incarnate evil that's working towards that then we wouldn't be able to enjoy that fantasy the truth is
[01:01:47] always always more painful to accept and the truth is is that our own self-hatred is how we disassociate that's disassociation forms into a collective plasma and then people compete for that disassociated plasma the plasma that you
[01:02:01] drain from yourself by not gaining your own power goes somewhere and there are people and agencies that want that they want what you reject and they collect it we do the
[01:02:14] same thing with garbage we send our computers overseas and people climb the barges and for months will spend their time sorting through dirty diapers to find your hard drive because that has something valuable in there it's the
[01:02:28] same thing and these are layers of hell but I don't mean hell in a bad way I mean like the true definition of what hell is there are layers of this kind of Consciousness and this kind of lack of
[01:02:42] Consciousness right it's a ladder it's a hermatic letter it's a Herm hermatic ladder letter that's funny hermetic ladder of Consciousness consciousness as a dog
[01:02:57] Consciousness as a fish Consciousness as a shark Consciousness as a human consciousness as an orca Consciousness is a blue whale these are ladders that we climb
[01:03:10] and just like our resolution now is like 15 million people can watch a DA say something wrong in three seconds so too can whales communicate where their whisper is heard a thousand miles away why is their whisper heard a th000
[01:03:25] mil away because they've accepted their power their vessel holds more righteousness because they understand their equipment and they do not make if
[01:03:39] you ever considered the reason why there are life forms that have more brain matter more dark brain matter more curvature which is considered to be the real source of intelligence is how much
[01:03:52] curvature is in the brain yet seem to lack the same kind of sentience as we do that perhaps the reason why they lack that sentience is because that kind of sapience isn't necessarily
[01:04:06] conscious our awareness of our own awareness could cause us to atrophy and narrow ourselves into a very very limited um perspective and that perspective would
[01:04:18] showcase itself just like this does now just like this now you guys are going fear is the mind killer The Little Death that brings total
[01:04:46] obliteration fear is an illusion I think uh I don't hate Jewish folk at all um I
[01:04:59] I I think fear is is almost always opportunity usually when when you have fear it's like a really special gift it's like you've been delivered an opportunity of electricity and it's it's you can't induce
[01:05:13] fear on yourself it's hard to induce fear on yourself I shouldn't say you can't it's hard to induce fear on yourself consciously there's the answer there's there's the right way to say it it's very difficult to induce fear under yourself consciously we will recreate certain traumas that we have to bring
[01:05:28] ourselves back to that fear so to me your fear is always the precipice of power it's always a precipice of of grandf funter change it's just a matter or not matter of whether or not you will seize it you
[01:05:45] know oh wow I think of phones is hearing age because we don't know how to listen in distance anymore yeah this is part of our ignorance we tune out what far far away but the blue whale can't this is
[01:05:59] why we're we don't necessarily want to jump into that you know yeah you know if you if you if you don't equate fear with with some sort of like negativity I think you can more approach it as
[01:06:14] a it's a static electricity's building in the air and if you have the right diode for it you can absorb that energy put it in a capacitor and use it later right that's just I try and look at fear like
[01:06:28] that when I can unless I'm too afraid if I'm too afraid then I won't so to me fear has never really been a bad thing in fact fear is really what kept us alive for so long you know that we're not ready to consciously see
[01:06:43] something but the haunches of our skin the pores of our skin can perceive these things and so starts to give us These Warnings but the mystery of it keeps us to where we don't shock so we can still run away do you see what I mean it's like
[01:07:03] that yeah Abyss opportunity stretch yeah Abyss is uh Abyss is a place it's a home base to become unconscious of something is to release yourself from the responsibilities that if you're driving
[01:07:22] down the road and you can't handle the pressure of who all you could injure just close your eyes close your eyes put it on cruise control climb in the back
[01:07:36] seat I don't think that's going to maybe work out for you in the physical world but spiritually mentally if you're able to do that that would be some of the most powerful magic you could wield right you could place that ignorance on
[01:07:52] you yeah you can't ignore that right this is why I tell people that that we we render we hallucinate reality because if we if we just saw it all full screen a lot of us would just freeze up I think
[01:08:06] me included I think we'd just freeze up about the only person who might not freeze up is someone who's been so traumatically trained like a trauma training that they're just capable of
[01:08:19] seeing things it'd be like an albino witch doctor is what it would look like who's been like brutally raped epigenetically for thousands of years so if you guys want to see the real reality
[01:08:32] all you have to do is just go get brutally you know traumatized for thousands of years and you're all set that's all it takes and I think if we understood the the leveling up of the trauma we
[01:08:45] experienced I think I think we wouldn't uh I mean we already know that it is kind of a badge you know like tattoos the fact that we we like tattoos is kind of I think reveals that that that we do
[01:08:58] recognize trauma as a as a spiritual uh Awakening but we're not we're not willing to accept it as a kind of medicine right so we still we're still embracing the sympathetic
[01:09:16] medicine yes zigarette yeah that's your immune system our brain Burns most calories blocking things out exactly your immunity uh requires a lot of electricity ultimately that's what it is
[01:09:29] if you consider that your immune system is in your ignorance is your immune system these are the same things we just we just are are locked in this old world of thinking of physiology you know most of the
[01:09:43] philosophers that that people want you to read before they you call yourself smart are going to be people that thought before electricity was a thing so you guys we're really way behind on
[01:09:56] on on even modern thinking we we've and and the classics have kind of done us a little bit of harm because for so long there's only been a few people heiger is a perfect example it's like uh back then
[01:10:11] you really didn't have anyone else to cling to who was suggesting that you were verb so you had to pick a guy that was like a Jew hater who who uh utilized
[01:10:22] the entire uh uh anti antisemitism uh thing to gain a position at a university so it's it's not and and I'm glad that these people
[01:10:35] are flawed I'm flawed we're all flawed but it's very old world thinking to look at these uh sort of like figureheads the only reason why these people were figureheads is because we
[01:10:50] didn't have the ability to do that for ourselves AI is making everyone editor which means Everyone's an artist right now and until everyone is an artist you're going to need artists in the world that you can
[01:11:04] venerate the whole point is it's a kind of training wheels so we really need to get back into sestry school really does need to be a lot more I hate to say it I don't hate to say it it's true school really should be James True live like
[01:11:18] the the stuff that maybe not today but or yeah today would work but like the topics that that that that are brought up should be fresh and new and and in the now they should be in the current vernacular dealing with things right now
[01:11:32] it shouldn't be about well until you can tell me haiger then don't think about reality or whatever I'm just saying that Academia is going to insist that you do that but Academia is just clinging to
[01:11:47] the same reverence that was cling to before and that that came from a a time that was pre- electricity this is steam powered thinking steam powered thinking got you uh Democrats and Republicans steam powered
[01:12:01] thinking got you uh honestly got you men landing on the moon because steam power thinking got you World War I it created this notion that there's conscious evil that's purposely waking
[01:12:16] up to do harm to you when I was a kid they told me that Iran was running cartoons where uh all day they were telling the kids how evil America was and I believed it because the news was
[01:12:29] telling me that so it must be true so we only fall for what we want to eat our digestion determines the propaganda that we will be fed it's not the other way around oh good thank you
[01:12:48] B yeah I I I think uh I think that school I I do think it'll get there but school really needs to be a lot more like this and as I predicted the end of the
[01:13:02] police earlier this week I really do think that that's just going to be impossible to maintain you know that'll just increase the smart cities even more there'll be much more AI used to Grant Privileges and more
[01:13:17] importantly to take them away I'm not excited about it um the video Steve Bannon is Q andon got pulled from YouTube it was like the third remake I've done of that video where I've tried as hard as I can to be
[01:13:33] as polite as I can to to not be found to be a bully but I'm I'm I'm trying to educate modern people now about the CEO of the Trump's campaign and I'm I'm called a
[01:13:47] bully and you can imagine if someone like me who's doing this on my own has that how much more expensive that would be if I was at a university and the buser's office or the
[01:14:00] dean was told that that I was bullying or that an Anti-Defamation League wanted me to use a certain textbook and that as long as we have this framework where we insist that we all reach from the same branches and pull the same olives because they came
[01:14:15] from the same figureheads we are going to be prone to propaganda that comes from a strategic place and that propaganda is going to have stories like uh Hillary Clinton wrote to NASA and they said that you can't be an astronaut because you're not a woman if you don't
[01:14:29] watch the stream you could go there on Wikipedia and read the debate and it actually says in the footnotes there is zero proof of this but it's still in Wikipedia it's still written into the vernacular and that's why at first
[01:14:44] you're going to think oh it's because people are evil in the world that's fine but if you want to feel better if you want to have more calories I want you to just picture that now it's reality and everything that's in the
[01:14:56] past everything that's in the future is mythology and if you understood that instead of having to convince yourself of that you you too are going to save more calories you're going to save and have more calories because you're not going
[01:15:12] to feel that the world is broken you're going to feel that the world is a rave and none of us can go home and probably there's some Molly in the water there's probably some mly in the water there is
[01:15:26] now if we remember that we chose to come here we're going to have a good time if we feel that we've been dropped here against our will we're going to have a bad time we get to choose right hey would you guys buy my book my
[01:15:41] new book my new book's out I got nine reviews I could use a lot more people are so much more about the eore that they're like oh it doesn't have enough reviews I'm not going to read it but all the reviews have been five stars it's called black eye
[01:15:53] Club um it's a a story about this is this like you know it's like this guy he falls in love with this woman and he can't say goodbye to her so he clones her and then he's like he's
[01:16:09] really smart he develops his serum the serum goes in your eye and it gives all these world leaders and these like upper echelon people the ability to see things in the world that they couldn't see before kind of like
[01:16:21] smells um it kind of like it breaks down all of what modern science really is is doing and gives you kind of like uh some scenarios as to where it's going a lot of it deals with genetics the fact
[01:16:36] that uh you know that ultimately our our genes are the are the final software Frontier and you know we're we're having this whole issue with clones right now and with genetic modification and and
[01:16:50] even with abortion and all those issues are going to have already fun M Ally changed in the light of it's not really new technology it's actually pretty old technology but it's new technology in
[01:17:04] the sense that the collective is finally willing to start to discuss these things and so crisper is sort of like a uh hey can we talk about this now and people are like yeah as long as it's just like really small yeah it's just
[01:17:18] theoretic and and that's that's that's kind of where we're at now but this this will be you you might think that the best way to understand a time is to go there but I think the best way to really understand
[01:17:31] a time is to go there like two generations after maybe it's not the best time but if you go there two generations after you're going to find all the uh all the
[01:17:48] Petrified kind of Gunk and you can use that to extrapolate what what was really happening there but until you can actually see what everyone is rejecting you it's really becomes a harder to have that Oracle of
[01:18:02] truth right as to what you're actually seeing yep crisper is such a uh it's a great book you guys says Raa thank you Raina thank you thank you for reviewing it too R now that
[01:18:20] means a lot um hey Renegade good to see you don't be anti-symmetric all right by the way I've been renovating my office I I don't expect you to see a lot but I just had
[01:18:54] to do a little bit drywall and I'm waiting on the paint to dry and then I did my deck rails and uh it just leads to a lot of a lot of stuff here's my my
[01:19:06] deck I'm not done on that side I still have the other layer but but uh so I I've been missing the I've been missing work uh the physical work has been fun though
[01:19:21] it's good to work in your body but uh yeah it just started raining yeah it does feel it it I love working physically it's great it's so funny how how for so long we were all like oh you're you're a white collar if
[01:19:36] you could stop physically working and I'm more just like man I really I was a blue collar this shit's fun it just feels good to move the body around you know it feels good to read too though that's for sure Grass Is Always Greener you know happy splitting a Mount Olive all
[01:19:50] what does that mean Lex that say Lex I'm having near siiz issues Lex vonder kudu wiing yeah what a difference a year Mak stretch wow this time last year I was
[01:20:03] heading to Rhode Island for uh for 55 yep yeah feels it's I'm actually kind of creating this for you guys I'm not trying to sound all like uh but but the the the studio that I'm making is is
[01:20:22] more cuz I just I just wanted to be dilating someone earlier said you're boring you know and uh you know I hear that all the time like I I I'm I'm listening to the paranoia all the time
[01:20:34] of is is is my show dilating enough or or whatever you know It's Tricky cuz you I I I wish I could just like tell you to be scared I think a lot of you would be
[01:20:47] like this is more exciting now you know um and it's not that I don't want you to be scared I just I just want you to capitalize on your fear that's all I just want you to capitalize on your fear and it's selfish
[01:21:01] it it it makes it it makes uh it makes my life better when all of you capitalize on your fear my life improves it just does I mean collectively that's how it all works you
[01:21:13] know if Le less of us were falling for what was happening now then D Santos two years ago never would have been able to pass the it's a felony in Florida to say what happened on the USS Liberty I mean seriously
[01:21:29] you're a veteran on the USS Liberty and you come to campus to give an eyewitness account and you were not being politically correct you can go to jail I wish the  that would happen I think if veterans were really
[01:21:44] veterans I I mean this I'm a veteran so I can say this I'm really disappointed in veterans massively disappointed the kind of that that that that they claim to be fighting for
[01:21:57] and to watch how Public Safety came in Article 1 Section 9 and literally trumped every single civil right that you've ever had is disgusting to me and it shows me that they are not Heroes including me as a veteran but there's no Heroes there no Heroes
[01:22:12] there and you know what there it'll never be that way because a hero is never going to be rewarded that's not someone being a hero that's someone profiting from the benefits offered to them if they they

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:22:24] obey orders is that really a hero ask yourself that do we reintroduce ourselves to our dearly departed when we die do we see them again as them or do we recognize them from the feeling and scent of them
[01:22:42] I'm 28 I miss my dad he passed in December um is that c casna is that if that's pronounced right kasna I this is just one of course I used to think no reincarnation
[01:22:58] isn't real because I think people are afraid of dying that's what I used to think because people are afraid of dying they're going to say that reincarnation is real that's what I used to think then I started to tap into some
[01:23:12] car carnal Instant Breakfast memories and the powdery goodness of the chocolate inside the yellowed Tupperware
[01:23:25] cup with the old school 2% milk is truly something that opens a like a wormhole into I'm just kidding I'm getting way off track but man Carnation insta breakfast was good stuff man they had
[01:23:40] strawberry I would drink it it's not like you know I'm like oh god let's kill this man who brought strawberry they had vanilla I would drink that too but holy
[01:23:52]  that carnation Instant Breakfast chocolate flavor it was like a kind of like kind of like flour basically it's like a flour and you pour milk in the flour and you Stir It Up man that was
[01:24:07] good man that was good I was talking about something oh yeah yeah yeah so reincarnation yeah malty there you go it's very malty that's so no matter how many times you stirred it it would still have like
[01:24:20] granules of goodness you like when you crunch them you'd see stars or something right there's something something about that okay reincarnation I started uh noticing that
[01:24:35] I was able to tap into some ancestral memories I don't mean like spatially memories of like limic being in a certain place I'm talking about abilities
[01:24:48] musically and literature wise I think that I really have tapped into my epigenetic ancestors my past lives and this is no different
[01:25:01] than uh my my beautiful dog butter I love you set I love you guy miss you so much and butter I had him his whole life and when he was like 14 he saw his first cow and
[01:25:17] he instantly herded it and brought it like three miles away and put it in a pen with no prompting the same way a spider will build a web that's been apparently proven in a lab
[01:25:31] that a spider is epigenetically building a web from his epigenetic memory and that generational web techniques are passed down or lost in certain chains so why would we not
[01:25:44] function that way too so now when I think about past lives I think that my DNA the shape of my bones the shape of my ant
[01:25:54] right the GC a t a a t g c t t a t g c t t if you wait like five million seconds I can tell you my whole code gttc GT a
[01:26:07] cc a all you ATC g g say there looking at you kid but that that is my antenna that's my IP address and when I come in I have that antenna it's so long that I can't even repeat it so I just have a copy stored in every cell and keep in
[01:26:23] mind every single cell has this IP address in it your personal genetic code so what my past life is is the hard drive the ghost right you you the the fragmentation memories of a hard drive
[01:26:37] which you know the CIA can like pull up your old hard drive and not just the CIA but you know they can recover data that's been defragged that you are able to I'm not saying because we have the it's just a really good analogy case so don't don't get all freaked out of me people but
[01:26:52] that you were able to because you have the same antenna you're going to listen to The Ghost of the machine of your own ancestors and a lot of epigenetic wisdom is going to be there no different than my dog butter no different than spiders
[01:27:02] you know things like that so you will Unite with your family line with that key so what the that happens when you don't have a
[01:27:16] key what is that like just just a thought in fact dasen hidinger himself I'll give him some credit was trying to to get to the essence of this nothingness which
[01:27:32] I'm about to bring up nothingness is not a thing the source the vector of nothingness is what he was talking about the place where nothingness originates
[01:27:45] from we don't fully understand that yet and I would like for you to consider that if you do not have a key to pull memories from a certain
[01:27:58] signature that perhaps you would simply recollect totality so your base state is God totality this is the osiron model that I
[01:28:16] was talking about earlier your base state is God totality your genetic key filters totality into a singular genetic IP
[01:28:29] address and for the last 200,000 years I use this word Loosely for the LA that number used Loosely but for the last 200,000 years all of the ancestral memories that were downloaded on that
[01:28:41] antenna are more accessible by you simply because of decompression you decompress your epigenetic uh this is not even
[01:28:54] speculation you're sarabellum right this the the ass cheeks of your brain if you if you don't know the exact medical term I like to call these the ass cheeks of your brain that the cerebellum has all of this epigenetic
[01:29:09] wisdom is there the problem is is that it's not easily pulled out of a folder it's kind of like uh if you ever been to web archive.org and you're trying to find an old homepage and all the
[01:29:24] homepages that that it has a record of are listed in one single sheet and when you click on all of them you're never going to be able to see the information to certain things there's just certain things it's not going to be able to show you but yet the archive is
[01:29:38] somehow still there and so your sarabellum is able to run algorithms without the code being there it's it's like the code takes up too much space the only reason why you would need the code for the algorithms that you have access to is because you're still
[01:29:53] rewriting them but the algorithm for balance the algorithm for coughing the algorithm for entering into an inic state where you throw something up because you ate
[01:30:06] something wrong this is code that's so old it's been uh machine languaged it's it's broken down into assembly code so the original code that was used the original hash that was used to write it
[01:30:19] is gone all you're looking at is just a stimulus response stimulus response it's a direct hardwire kind of a thing which I think is just here for compression it's the only way that we could store
[01:30:31] 200,000 year old memories in a system so to me this would be a closer model of what it's like to recollect through reincarnation you you just don't know where you've been the last 200,000 years
[01:30:46] so some of you will say well I remember being on the pyramids my mom remembers guarding the pyramids and so I just in my model I picture that that she was there that her that same line was there and you that
[01:31:00] same line was there guarded keep in mind that your reincarnated memories don't have to be the actual limic experience it would be the hallucination of the limic experience here's what I mean if you were to
[01:31:14] uh to have a lifelong obsession with the pyramids and you were to uh uh or or actually maybe even better example you uh in a previous life you did a play
[01:31:27] where you uh you were a guard on a pyramid in the play but being in the play gave you so much more exposure to witness than you've ever had that it dilated you more than anything else it
[01:31:39] had and so those memories end up registering as epigenetic markers that you can pull stuff up again 88's very magic number uh so so when you pull up
[01:31:53] your epigenetic memories you're not actually pulling up memory code you're pulling up dilational events I'm suggesting that the only reason why you're able to memorize them is because they were dilating in some
[01:32:06] way if you were to successfully herd a cow for the first time as a dog and you were to be rewarded for that you were to recognize that this was the task that I was trained to do you would be more
[01:32:19] dilated than you would be had you not done that and so that ation forms a marker that you remember it I think pain I know that pain works the same way guys if you haven't watched talking to reptiles my series you need to watch it and if you don't want to watch that series read the book black eye Club
[01:32:34] because it's telling you this stuff because the the same thing that the pain happens if you experienced a snake bite three generations ago epigenetically you have a fear of snakes because that code is strong that code is running in
[01:32:49] you and this is why I say fear isn't necessarily something to be afraid of it's the opportun to hack ancient cerebellum code that you're only going to be able to hack when you have that fearce state I think because you probably have to match the same dilation
[01:33:04] this is why trauma therapy is so hard like PTSD and stuff if you want to cure someone who's in Shell Shock you have to return them to the shell shock but in a voluntary way how the do you do that and one of the ways we do this now
[01:33:18] believe it or not is for virtual reality that people will reenact car accidents in a Bonafide way this actually helps worked on some of this stuff but by simply recreating the car accident one can enter a VR experience of that and just lose that Panic response they have
[01:33:32] because they're able to practice under the fear this is what I was talking about earlier about how fear is this way I only have 32 likes 32 is a lot but it's it's still what the Masons would
[01:33:44] call a uh a non-royal number it's still a uh outer Church kind of a number which means that we haven't even broken into into the esoterics of what I'm saying so this is sad I've been
[01:33:58] here 94 minutes divided by 32 that's every 3 minutes I'm able to pull maybe one like out of some of you guys wow that is something isn't
[01:34:10] it anyway we'll be back in the office soon have better slides and stuff go horizontal you know you can go horizontal right BC's 33 yeah I see him now too I uh oh good Renegade got the 33
[01:34:25] yeah and likes don't even really help it's that's why I don't really ask him for much you can subscribe that would help but uh I don't need help it's okay I mean you buy my book you're a patron that helps that's great I'm just glad glad glad you guys are watching I
[01:34:39] appreciate it you could do it through sematic work too but I would carefully find the right person so I think that Discerning light I think we're talking about the same thing I think that you could do it through sematic work too that's that's
[01:34:53] what think you're doing right like the PTSD uh replay therapy is you're somatically placing yourself in that same posture that's what the VR would do right is you're placing yourself in that
[01:35:05] uh same posture so you can have a uh uh an experience I I I don't want to get too well I don't have a choice uh I I I pretend all the time I can
[01:35:19] control what I say and like yesterday I did this talk with and like I can't believe some of the things I said it's just I have no control over my mouth this is probably why you guys like live streaming I forget what I was talking about I don't know if I'm going to
[01:35:37] recover that yes if the rain's too loud that's cool yes but you can work with the person instead of doing it through VR too yeah I didn't mean to say that VR was the way to do it I just meant that
[01:35:51] VR is kind of like animiz the oh I know what I was going to talk about intimacy sexual intimacy God how do you talk about that I've met women that have had sexual
[01:36:09] intimacy issues and they utilize the uh intimacy with me to work on those sexual issues and I've seen that that I've seen seen that go both
[01:36:25] ways I I'm old I've been around I I've seen that go both ways I've seen that be a successful portal and then I've also seen where God how do I talk about this without being vulgar I I I was with a
[01:36:42] girl once and she wanted to relive uh I'm not going to she wanted yeah she wanted to relived some sort
[01:36:55] of molestation but she didn't want me to be a part of it because it would ruin it for her she wanted to be uh
[01:37:07] violated by me and I didn't know that until this is not what you think it is if you think that it's like a violence I don't mean that it intimacy when you don't want intimacy is a form of violation just so you know I I don't
[01:37:23] you know what think whatever you want to think about me I don't  give a the uh in the middle of the act all of a sudden she went like really
[01:37:35] cold fish and I think if I would have been less conscious I would not have noticed a and b i maybe could have taken it personally if I was even lesser
[01:37:50] conscious and that she put me in a weird position because she brought me to a place and then left me and wanted me to fulfill the idea of being the
[01:38:04] perpetrator when in fact what she was doing was actually perpetrating on herself through the triangulation of me she was analizing her desire to
[01:38:17] repeat this event and utilizing the sematic equipment that I have on my my body to implement that and the irony is is that because
[01:38:29] someone had abandoned her a long time ago she felt completely justified in doing that to me and because she was a
[01:38:42] victim none of what she was doing to me counted as being alterior subversive unkind dismissive or any of those things
[01:38:54] and when this happened to me I I stopped I it's not like I could have gone on anyway I I I smell chicks I I I I like chicks so it's like I'm going to want you to be into this and
[01:39:08] so when when when when this smell came up I stopped and I asked if she was okay and she said yes and I was like
[01:39:18] wow that is so not uh not a yes and I remember picturing how this would go if I wasn't me what would happen in that state if I
[01:39:36] would not have been conscious of where I was if I would have contined but more importantly how much of her victimhood of Olympics that she could have either passed or failed by recreating that that thing I know I said I don't give a but are you guys freaking out are you
[01:39:50] guys like oh my God I can't believe you  said that I don't know but it's I think that most of the time when you're looking at someone that that I don't know if it's most of the time I don't know the numbers okay I think I
[01:40:02] think there's a certain number of times when you hear someone claim rape especially when it's after the fact that you're watching the Dynamics of their
[01:40:15] past even the past they're not conscious of enacting itself inside the pra economy and utilizing the Le cage of the other witness right to recreate an event and and I I don't mean to say this is just girls or you know it obviously
[01:40:30] could happen for either one but in my case I've I've watched that happen in in in the intimacy of the moment and been very distraught and
[01:40:42] Disturbed and kind of like well  what do I do now and honestly I don't know if me just simply stopping was really the best thing to do you might be going what the did you
[01:40:55] just say what I mean is is that that person only felt rejected by me they were looking for I don't think they're conscious of this but they were looking to recreate that moment but then somehow
[01:41:12] find uh Power in it let's just say that the way that she would have found power in that is to Hope that I would not notice her
[01:41:26] disassociation and continue and then simply by her claiming that that that you violated me which which would would be correct in this in this framework but keep in mind this is a hallucination she's
[01:41:41] having it would allow her to recreate that and either grow from it or more importantly find a safety net keep in mind that we fail for strategic reasons we will go to to daaba and leave
[01:41:55] before cutting off Darth Vader's head because we're not ready for that yet sometimes this is the kind of truth that gets me uh in all these weird squiggly lines but if you look at how we even started with the whole Jew thing is
[01:42:08] might as well right I mean we're already here if you're living in a hyena world where I'm innocent until proven guilty the entire scenario that I just told you is impossible in a court of law there's no way to even know what the happened in those re you're looking at
[01:42:24] just jousting lawyers at that point but more importantly you're looking at the eagor of society of well who's typically the victim or who's typically this or who's typically the perpetrator or it's you're just looking at the mechanics of fashion at that
[01:42:38] point when you get past the hyena morality you you become like me where I am respon if your smell changes in the middle of our intimacy and I don't notice that that's my sin not yours even
[01:42:52] if I have your verbal consent that doesn't change  and I think the truth of that is that when we understand all of us to have the capacity to act like children at any point in time purely based on the amount of calories we have then we
[01:43:07] become more responsible for our world which means it becomes much more difficult and people will end up calling you all kinds of of words because you're just simply not living in the same static reality as they are the static reality where so many facts get
[01:43:21] missed do you realize how how many times the jury's been called crazy I can't believe that jury ruled that way and then when you really look at the case you find out that the just an example the the perpetrator's past wasn't
[01:43:35] admissible in court it wasn't even allowed to be admissible and when you hear that once you might not think much of it when you hear it two three times you might not think much of it but when you start to hear that it's not admissible thousands
[01:43:48] of times you realize that court is actually not the place where you go for truth Tru court is the place where you collapse your waves and determine A or B which side you're creating a binary of every single event and you're awarding it to
[01:44:03] the plaintiff or the prosecution or the defense excuse me and Academia does the same way the capillaries of professorships are only going to be able to put out the tiniest
[01:44:16] modules of blood they're not able to look at the entire vessel they're never going to give you the juice that's inside the artery they're going to give you the tiniest little drop that comes out of the capillary because all the
[01:44:29] other stuff is admissible inside of Academia the fact that Egypt could somehow have communicated with meso with meso America is not admissible in a court of
[01:44:42] Academia it's not admissible because we have no context to uh allow ourselves to believe in nonlinear time because that would defeat the purpose of civilization if civilization collapses what's the  point says academic science so
[01:44:58] that is rejected from the vernacular this has to make sense to you guys yeah you're not going to see the truth in court and you might think that's where you do it you're not going to find wisdom in Academia and you might think that's where it's going to happen
[01:45:14] and neither one of them happens where does it happen it happens in the field it happens in situations like that that girl used to read me the velvetine rabbit and I think that she was trying
[01:45:28] to appeal to the fact that I didn't have hair that I was still loved she played me and I think that the reason because she because I was old enough to realize I was being played and I wasn't just
[01:45:43] falling for the possibility of what this man I was going to get laid and touch touch a sacred vagina you know all that stuff that that that men have because I was uh I've touched enough sacred vagina to where I'm like okay you know I can
[01:45:57] actually maybe think a little bit now before I touch them that that I'm see the same thing I'm recreating that same experience so I can try and level up the next time I encounter that that it's only through the uh repetition of that
[01:46:10] of those events that I'm able to sense and really get get an idea about you know what's actually coming in oh look at this camera and gave me a Super Chat black eye Club is fast-paced Rich with imagery and dense with import
[01:46:25] quintessential truth in fiction I highly recommend it thanks for the excellent read James thank you Cameron thank you so much you're already supporter I appreciate that so much but yeah it's it's guys if you I need to know if you don't like the book so I'll stop writing
[01:46:38] seriously I need to know if if you want me to stop writing I will or if you want me to like could you please write about how we're all wearing nipple clamps and then the world is a nipple clamp Turtle World Turtle nipple clamp
[01:46:53] island is that was if you want a book about Turtle nip clamp Island you know let me know in the comments so I can tell you to suck my dick I did not say that I did not say that I did not say that so yeah we we uh we're creative
[01:47:07] right certainly not in divorce court says Paisley yeah another reason to not get a marriage license you know you're right and divorce is like the ultimate
[01:47:20] crucifixion and that's good it's good I I uh oh thank you Raina I'd love to write the uh the other books actually there's a lot of that already written uh uh so so yeah that's even

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:47:49] ripped my heart out like like that's just my perspective I mean I'm sure I ripped her heart out too blah blah blah you know I'm a horrible you know all this stuff it's I I don't mean to be Li of it it my point is is
[01:48:02] that that was the the breaking of my cherry about what love really is not in a bad way just the the the profound depth of love and what it means and
[01:48:14] uh uh people will will will try and criticize you because you're divorced but but really it's kind of like jumping off a high dive divorces and only some of us are going to have the balls to actually do that to actually have our
[01:48:28] heart ripped out like that and I've notice that the people that are divorced have so much more compassion when it comes to understanding the the truth of the world I'm not talking about what
[01:48:40] their ex is in fact because we do not consider divorce to be a constructive act we tend to hate our exes I think it's the people that understand that the divorce was a constructive act that they don't hate their exes anymore I this is
[01:48:54] a big clue guys if you're struggling with this I think the main reason why you're struggling with it is because you feel the divorce is like the bad end or like it meant it didn't work or it meant it's broken or something and it's actually quite the opposite and
[01:49:09] typically the ones that are divorced have a much more uh better time I think at just relationships with people you really get a sense of knowing yourself because you've had this sacred ritual of
[01:49:22] of having something broken that you thought was going that had the sanctity to be unbreakable that's a special thing to have this is why I talk about fear the way I do you you get to experience those
[01:49:35] things and by experiencing these things this really is the pollen that you came for you came for this you came here to be divorced I know it sounds crazy but you did a lot of us
[01:49:49] just don't you know bro do you smoke weed I bet you don't no Teddy I've never smoked weed do you mean cannabis no I've never no what is that what is that like
[01:50:02] would would I would my mind expand if I did let me know I I want to hear what would happen to me if I did James have you ever considered testosterone replacement therapy for Health and Longevity reasons
[01:50:17] no um have you ever considered Testo I didn't know that testosterone replacement therapy was a longevity I think it's a Vitality is it a longevity thing too are people
[01:50:31] claiming that I I I just don't know I uh I'm not actually I'm I'm fine to die I'm pretty sure I'm going to die I think I'll probably die in like 10 years um I just look at my family
[01:50:45] history also this last year like people that used to watch me that are fans of me they've like cast me into certain categories they've given me diseases and  people have tried to or tried to give me diseases people have tried to
[01:50:57] food poison me um I don't have a family so I I don't I think part of what makes my writing so free is that I I really gave up on the whole oh I have to survive oh it's so Pro that I survived a long time ago and you just kind of relax
[01:51:11] you just kind of enter into a uh you could call it resignation but it's also you find a new gear and so um the only kind of therapy that I might seek out would be therapy
[01:51:25] that would just give me a deeper immersion into the world and I just don't suffer from that I uh Jeffrey I don't really feel like I suffer from anything like um I mean there's certain medical issues
[01:51:38] that I I wish weren't there like uh falling off the deck didn't help certain things certain surgery I had several years ago didn't help but but uh I you know that's just like wear and tear and if anything it just made me appreciate my body
[01:51:53] more uh for for what I have but you know people call me bald and I I don't I don't really understand that like even that has a weird thing I mean I get it I'm supposed to not like myself because I don't have hair I think that's the idea but really it just feels like we're
[01:52:08] just shopping for ways of like not liking ourselves and you know so we can call ourselves old or bald or gay or you know whatever whatever the fashion is right now to to hate on ourselves which
[01:52:22] I I think hating on yourself is quite honestly pretty healthy sometimes sometimes you you are living too high you're you're holding yourself to a higher posture than you can afford and
[01:52:36] you don't have the balls to bow out and say guys I'm just putting a little bit too pressure too much pressure on myself so instead you flagrantly lose face in front of people so that they will expect less from you and that's how we slow
[01:52:51] down and that's some selfish trickery isn't it it's the same thing as disassociating on someone in the middle of you know what I mean um yeah yeah the it's I to me I I think it's uh knowing that I or thinking that
[01:53:13] I have 10 years to live is uh yeah and I'll be 53 like really soon so I think it's 11 years I bet it'll be 64 it probably be 63 just cuz god'll be like you didn't get what you thought you
[01:53:27] were going to get and that'd be funny too I'd be like yep you got me but uh you know I think this makes me work more efficiently I I think it I think it makes my life
[01:53:40] better there something about sovereignty if you think about it when you place your own your own hourglass up and many of you could say well that's nihilistic and you're just it's like yeah but it's it's really only nihilistic if you think
[01:53:54] you're not going to die and remember maybe you don't remember this cuz maybe it wasn't today sometimes you wake up and you forget about a cosmology that you're trying to adopt sometimes you forget
[01:54:08] that you slip back into an old world of thinking and I think most of our old world of thinking is is that I'm not going to die or that death is just for special people and if you lean in I'm not saying do this
[01:54:23] but if you do lean into it like I do it just kind of makes every day more I think it makes every day more valuable because as long as I remind myself of that cosmology as much as I can I end up
[01:54:36] having that as I've never felt bored like I haven't felt bored in a long long long long long long time I can't even think of the last time I felt bored and I think part of that is is because I don't have the nihilism kind
[01:54:50] of maybe not nihilism I don't have that it's important to have that false Tim Hood you're going to live forever I'm not saying everyone should embrace the fact they're going to die but if you can afford to embrace the fact that you're going to die I think it'd be the same as
[01:55:03] saying look man we can jam for 18 minutes or we can see if we can compress this jam into a three minute song so at least people can hear it it's like I I I do have a vested interest in
[01:55:17] this place um recognizing that I was here that is important to me it doesn't really matter to me if people say that that's wrong or like I don't get why we're not making a
[01:55:31] bigger deal out of our own lives anyway most of the criticism that I get is that well why are you talking why are you saying this why are you why do you not have more credentials before you talk or why do you not have more fans
[01:55:45] before you talk or have more this or more that and it's just because there's no time back in the day of the classics it was so easy to say well I'm not Charles Dickens so I shouldn't write and that
[01:55:57] guy was bloviator I'm sorry but  man you know and I get some of you guys are all over tolken but man there's so many plot holes in that story it's like I get that you're like oh we got to suck the ancient dick of tolken I
[01:56:12] get it but it's like when you look at what actually is out there now I think you could really kind of come to grips with the fact that that um just scarcity it needs you need more than
[01:56:25] scarcity to give that much veneration to something scarcity is important that's why I brought it up because in relation to how short your life is but I don't just want to live 64 63
[01:56:36] short years I want those years to be you know I want to put out stuff I want to Output while I'm there and so having that sort of uh uh hourglass you know helps you hold
[01:56:52] that posture it's like pulling a grenade when you're born and holding it in your hand the whole time you might think that this is insane and crazy and it is that's insane that's
[01:57:06] crazy uh I wouldn't want to eat next to someone doing that but you would never really not take any moment seriously every moment let me rephrase that every
[01:57:18] moment would be important and so I think that there Comes A Time this is what I think by the land of the Brave is this Ancient Ancient kind of Apache sort
[01:57:32] of uh or commanche maybe sort of uh way of living almost kamakazi although not quite because that was more dissociated I think from what I understand it but uh
[01:57:47] yeah cuz a lot of them were on meth and  but uh like like you know Janice jappling yourself into you know look I my only goal is to write summertime I whatever how many drugs I need to do to
[01:57:59] get it out that's what I'm here for and and you you know I I don't think that my my tactic is right or the you know the quest that I have but uh
[01:58:11] um I think it's a noble goal to to want to want to be some salt and have your salt last for a while W is is it's a cool thing to think about you know it's cool it doesn't give you
[01:58:27] infinity it doesn't give you everlasting life it doesn't even change really what I do while I'm here I think if I had more of an external life it would if I was more focused on what do people want to hear me say versus what do I say this
[01:58:41] would be very different and I think I'd be more successful honestly it when it comes to just like like more than nine reviews and things like that you know if it was more about the Jews or this and and it's a trap and you know uh they're
[01:58:56] reptilian overlords you know whatever it is that and and there there are repti know underlords I call them underlords because it's your Ed but hey that's just me right that's just me what does
[01:59:10] toltech shamak talk about not sure what you mean by that I mean I get those words but um oh know somebody's experiencing some loss huh sorry to hear that guys but even those losses you
[01:59:32] know yeah Paisley just lost her other sister yeah I'm sorry to hear that my older sis oh other older sister sorry sorry to hear that Paisley yeah and this is kind of what I mean it
[01:59:50] it if we didn't die none of us would have the amplification of how important life is and more importantly if we didn't find each other's bodies none of us would know that we die none of us would
[02:00:05] know that we Decay and if we don't if we don't see that process happening I think it's harder to associate into the world we lose the ability to imbue it with importance it
[02:00:18] be sort of like playing a video game where you don't really care where you really just don't care you're not engaged the graphics don't do anything at all I would say it's like pong but pong is pretty engaging it's uh
[02:00:32] there's just certain things that you just don't feel engaged about and so death is here to engage us it compresses the witness into a a small chamber much
[02:00:44] like a piston and that torque is really what makes your life go and if you watch talking to reptiles you you know that that all the chemicals in your brain work the same way they they play with this idea of death of scarcity of
[02:00:57] limitation and that really that's what makes you finally resolve decisions you know the dopamine is the thing that actually pays the the fair for you to get up off the couch and the only reason why you'd be able to get off off the couch is because the dopamine is is
[02:01:12] rewarded you enough to tell you there's something in it for you if you get up so even to bribe you to get off the couch the dopamine has to make you these promises of about what kind of lyic experience you're going to have in the
[02:01:24] kitchen when you eat another bon bon or whatever and so the entire process is based on the uh uh constriction and then the release of pleasure in the
[02:01:37] thalamus and so every time your sister dies which only happens once the first time that happens you are immensely uh more aware of the value of
[02:01:50] life of the importance of life and I think this place would be cruel as if none of us had that value torque behind it if that makes sense like it just it just wouldn't be
[02:02:04] wouldn't be possible do I resonate with the toltech shaman teachings change I'm not sure what those are la la la Yao Zoo mean I
[02:02:16] get LSU but the ya is yeah so I'm not sure about the toltech shamanic teach teachings I'm not sure that I'm not I don't know what those are oops Yeah Martin says apparently it's what allows us to actually have a
[02:02:40] Consciousness the process of dying P thinks I'm question I value my legacy I'll make make some art play with my dog give all my and storage away move out and be of service yeah
[02:03:03] yeah questioning your value is really the whole reason why we're here so many people um want you to feel valueless because they want it's almost like you threaten them
[02:03:19] because you're you're pulling too much value and you're making them feel bad like can you just think less valuable about yourself please God you're making me look bad it's like
[02:03:33] that when the last death in my family was my uncle and uh I was working at a newspaper in Asheville a weekly newspaper and I've been there for like three years never taken a vacation and I was the only man in the
[02:03:46] family um you know with my grandmother being there is just he was the the only man down there with him and my aunt and so I I told my boss I'm going to go down to that funeral and he goes well not if you can't find someone to do your job while you're gone
[02:04:01] and I was kind of like Don on me wait a minute this guy doesn't think I should ever get to leave it's kind of so I left and I went down the funeral and
[02:04:16] uh I was really ashamed of myself because they asked me to speak at the funeral and I and I cried and I I was just was really ashamed of myself for that I felt like I let my uncle down um because in the middle of me talking I was
[02:04:30] crying and it it was kind of like the that death wasn't just him dying I came back and my job was gone um and that was the last place I ever worked at like the last employment I had
[02:04:46] under someone else's umbrella I was freelanced from that moment on because I'd done the right thing it wasn't fun to go to Tampa it wasn't fun to look at my uncle's dead pasty ass
[02:04:59] body that I can't believe that that his mom wanted him decorated like that I I could I couldn't believe that but you know whatever it's just it's that my entire life changed because of that
[02:05:14] death it put me exactly where I needed to be and not once when that was happening did I think that that's what was happening not once but the importance of that watching that my uncle was gone realizing that was all
[02:05:27] it took noticing how everyone else in my family kind of reacted to it I mean my grandmother was definitely moved but it's like it didn't really feel like it mattered that much I think in a lot of
[02:05:39] ways my uncle was like a black sheep and so in a lot of ways it it I wondered if they even minded you know and I think that's when you really
[02:05:51] SNS in how importance how how much important self worth is you know like how important you are to your life and if you can if you can leverage this Paisley you really do find yourself in
[02:06:05] another spot because you you're not bored anymore not that you're bored but more importantly you really find the importance in finding pleasure by yourself you you notice how much more important that is yesterday I was on a stream and this
[02:06:19] guy was asking me about these other thinkers and I'm just are just like I don't think it's important to watch those guys I just don't I mean I get that because I'm a streamer I should be aware of what these guys are saying I
[02:06:32] guess but I just it it doesn't really put me in more importance what I think is important and the society is supposed to
[02:06:47] tell you that that's self-centered and and it is I believe in self-centered I think that the more self-centered you become the Richer your life becomes and the Richer your life becomes the more moral morality you output because
[02:07:00] there's just an abundance that just comes from your pores because everyone notices how seriously you're taking your life and people are going to resent you for that they're going to insist you shouldn't be that arrogant there a lot of that but after a while when you break
[02:07:14] the surface tension of those people you they those people abandon you that's what happens and then you find a new group of friends that that truly seek that so these deaths I think it's
[02:07:27] important to die every decade every decade find a way to die and sometimes you won't be able to do that because you're too afraid it's like the high dive and luckily luckily you have your brothers and sisters to
[02:07:40] die for you that they give you the chance to have that and whether or not you leverage that right that's going to really determine you know what happens did you leverage that death because to
[02:07:54] me I honored my uncle's death because it trans transmuted me in big ways I drove down to my uncle's house and uh he lived alone no one was staying
[02:08:05] there and I slept I slept in his bed and I just listened for his ghost stayed there for two or three days looking for my uncle's ghost and I was a stranger in his house
[02:08:20] I'd never been to his house um just the Dynamics of our family he would always come to my grandmother's house and uh I never asked honestly I was too young then to even know to ask those things to even know that I would want to see see
[02:08:34] what he lived like and I think in society would deem him to be uh an an unhealthy person I think but I found his house to be one of the most artistic
[02:08:48] places I'd ever seen the the thing that he had done because he didn't have money to accomplish things I found Brilliance in those I found his ability to engineer his way
[02:09:02] out of poverty to be truly stunning it moved me more than anything else had and my grandmother was just embarrassed that he had stuff I know she loved him don't get me
[02:09:16] wrong but it's the stuff that he had I think embarrassed her it was just weird right all the things he had was junk and it was junk because he wasn't a a normal Sint you know stuff like
[02:09:30] that and i' tell you more about it but you you really you just had to be there some of the things that he had rigged up and his his truck had a a
[02:09:40] airplane dashboard from like a a cesna like his truck dashboard was a sess Cessna dashboard and I it took me like a day and a half to realize this
[02:09:55] was off of Cessna I'm like sitting in his truck looking at this thing going what the is it and like the back rear part of his truck was missing there like two feet was missing so he just
[02:10:09] installed the tail light two feet closer to the the passenger cab and I'm that might sound like a no-brainer but to me at the time that was brilliant it to me the only the only way you could have fixed that is I would have had to
[02:10:24] have rebuilt the end of the truck to equal the other light which might sound stupid to you but at the time I at the time it moved me how brilliant he was and the Brilliance that I was seeing was he had stepped out of the
[02:10:38] connotations see I was living in my grandmother's world of of well no you need a bumper that's horizontal and you you know you know you you need stuff like that and he he had found a way to carve a life
[02:10:52] outside of that he carved his own technology belief you know so to me his death was I think I got to know him more than I'd ever had before I feel bad now for some of the things I said to him not that I was trying to be mean to him but
[02:11:05] the growing up I was trying to relate to him and and uh I really was too shallow I think to to kind of meet him if that makes sense and it I only saw that because of the death it was really the
[02:11:18] only way I was able to see that in fact I I think I see him more than anyone else in my family just because I was there looking at his ghost watching uh watching the things he' done he had a an old desk lamp and
[02:11:34] he had spray painted it with blue and it made the most beautiful color on his desk it's the most beautiful color on his desk this old school Bank desk light but because he had painted the light
[02:11:46] bulb blue fluorescent light bulb blue and I only saw that because I turned on that light like he probably sat there at that desk for decades and he probably did it alone he
[02:12:00] was a highway worker not a lot of people really like got him but he was an artist and a highway worker way into Jesus and uh it's almost like I was there to witness his life for
[02:12:13] him you know so so maybe that's that's what it's named Sam Uncle Sam literally that was my Uncle Sam right pretty cool right literally my uncle
