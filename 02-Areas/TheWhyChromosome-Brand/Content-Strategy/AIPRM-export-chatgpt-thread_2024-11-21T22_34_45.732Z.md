[05:29] healthiest [ __ ] books to pull I it's actually really really difficult to keep the show down we have three Acts we have three Acts and I'm thinking this
[05:43] is like Prairie Home Companion on acid or on psilocybin or on DMT or or are are my favorite is uh just just be it yourself man being like really grounded
[05:56] but like seeing seeing things seeing things for the first time it's it's this kind of you're getting that flow state zone you're licking quartz rocks on top of Grandfather Mountain you're literally
[06:09] licking the rock going I'm tasting the knowledge of the oldest mountain in the world by licking this quartz that kind of stuff and and you can participate in this ritual with us on five five in Rhode Island 5'5 in Rhode Island so it's just
[06:24] something to get to keep quiet a little quiet hey that's good to know tell me if this is better tell me if this is better it could be that that's better George but you let me know if it's too loud because I appreciate the help we've been switching back and forth back and forth between uh PC and windows here it's been
[06:39] painfully the way and uh if they made a uh anyway not going to bore you with that I want I've been wanting to talk to you
[06:48] guys a lot about uh uh this douche dude dude and this actually is not like a full musk episode The I've actually had those you can check it out
[07:03] I actually have those before we begin I think I'm just going to officially have to disembark from the SS Rock fan I'm gonna hit reload one more time and uh Rockman did not give me the page stop loading right when the stream started so
[07:20] um sorry in Iraqis Rock fees out there that uh yeah I'm officially closing that um but uh yeah I wanted to talk about um um
[07:33] video production of five five a good question self-taught astronaut we'll we'll actually get to that we'll we'll get to that what let's do some let's do some goodies now before we begin I need to take this
[07:48] moment to do a little bit slapping I I love you guys I do and and I don't say these things to try and be harsh I don't say these things to try
[08:00] and convey some sense of of superiority although I gotta admit this would be one this this really would be one and I'm not saying me necessarily with
[08:13] you but but so much of the audience out there is consciously their buds are or squeezed and and we embrace them with our
[08:30] compassion and we see who they are but sometimes it gets really frustrating and you understand that that's how we got here we we came through that too but this idea
[08:44] that Christians have about saying that that it's the Jews I find insulting because of Zionism
[08:55] Zionism is in the word Zion ISM the belief in Zion Zion is what the promised land so right from the start a Zionist believes that there is a concept
[09:10] called promised land that that that that that is the basic element of Zionism and and there's there's a psychological element too and that psychological element is that
[09:23] Zionism is a better place all of Zionism involves the idea that there is a Golden Hill and if we do enough immoral things we will justify all of those immoral things
[09:37] we did because we will attain the moral Hill it is the most [ __ ] kind of empathy chip algorithm breach that you've ever seen and most most of the truth or audience
[09:51] is there I'm sorry but they just are they're there these are the people that are like there is only moral objectivity and it is defined in scripture and there is there is only moral objectivity and
[10:04] it is defined by God these are the same Concepts the concept of there is one right way it is the quickening right I cut your head off no I cut your head off
[10:16] and whichever one of us cuts off the other person's head gains Zion while the person that loses their head loses it on behalf of Zion
[10:29] Zionism is the belief that you lack something it's a very important concept Zionism is the belief that you lack something and the ability for you to feel more
[10:44] charged about Zionism is directly proportional to how much lack you feel is warranted is there and this is the heart of six million shoes
[10:57] this is at the heart of six million shoes that the Zionism can be so pure that you will actually breach your thought process from Auschwitz Museum literally
[11:12] reject their data and say no it was six million shoes and the reason why when we dig up the Aztec Mounds and we uncover the templo mayor when we
[11:27] unseat the walls of skulls we don't find that the Aztecs were saving uh shoes they weren't killing their victims and saving the shoes
[11:41] they were saving their skulls skulls are real skulls are the essence of a victim skulls are a trophy shoes as we've seen across the malls if
[11:58] we as we've seen in the wanal sexton the red wire of AP and the blue ryer of Reuters have shown you page after page of Fallen shoes and the
[12:10] shoes are always new and they're always strewn about in a pile as if there was some sort of sorrowful dramatic play that unfolded and the only thing that remained were these shoes
[12:25] that the moment something evil happens the first thing that occurs is that people disappear but their shoes remain and some will say well the problem
[12:39] the problem is with the shoes who control the media the shoe companies control the media and so it is their fault and so we run into the mall we run into the food court and we tear down the
[12:53] Chick-fil-A and we grab that guy from the Tie by the tie and we say we will have Chick-fil-A no more and you will feel this cleansing that you cleaned the area and brought in a
[13:08] New Zion and it's a [ __ ] Cinnabon but it doesn't matter because you're you're your appetite to be quenched
[13:20] of literally burying the very torch that you refuse to grasp you use to burn down the next villager and insist you guys are the source of my problem and that is at the heart of Zionism because Zionism
[13:34] is something was promised and it's better than anything we've ever had therefore it's morally correct regardless of what we have to do to get it and these two ideas are deep-seated
[13:48] in the truth movement because they're deep seated in the psyche of man this is not a result of the truth movement you emerge from the realization of what a [ __ ] hypocrite you are and
[14:02] that takes so much to pull yourself from the La Brea Tar Pits that you end up calling yourself a conspiracy theorist and you have no choice because you cannot believe
[14:14] how desperate you were to blame your entire life on someone else that it is the deepest form of fluffing that
[14:26] Babylon gives you she wraps her genitalia lips around every every nipple every piece of you that could possibly feel anything at all and tells you you
[14:39] are a victim you are a victim and this is how we are caught in the sleep inside the bubbly juices
[14:53] of this Matrix it is in the belief that we are entitled it is in the belief that we are victims it is in the belief that it is the fault of the shoes
[15:05] as you cling to the gourd and say this is the way it's such a [ __ ] move that the world created the stigma around [ __ ]
[15:25] that's how [ __ ] it is and when we start to look first of all why is Milo smelling his fingers why why is he smelling his fingers second of all why is a billionaire on his cell phone
[15:45] third of all Jews are not zionists say it with me I don't care if it hurts Jews are not zionists
[16:03] Christians are zionists that's why it's not the Jews you don't get to blame the Jews you don't you can only blame the zionists it's the only ones that you can
[16:18] blame and me the captain of don't blame anyone is literally telling you you my friend can blame the zionists you can blame them
[16:29] because they are the witch Hunters they are the ones that that elicit elicit the person that comes into the village The witchfinder General and literally picks the one out of all
[16:44] of you to be the scapegoat for their problems this is a function of Zionism and from the very early age
[16:56] these zionists said we are too clean for money therefore we will only lend from these people that we call Dirty and so we borrow and land from them
[17:08] because morally we are now cleansed the hypocrisy the psychopathy the sociopathy is disgusting but we need that scapegoat
[17:21] we need it and the only way we can convince it to play is to give it all of our gambling to give it all of our vices to give it all of our of our eyes for porn of our desire for Hollywood
[17:36] is to give it all and say as long as you were the one profiting from it then I can still partake but I get to blame you for everything it is a transaction
[17:49] a zionistic transaction that requires two [ __ ] people a billionaire does not sit on the plane with a dude that smells his [ __ ] fingers and tries to hide in the phone
[18:04] this is not the behavior of a billionaire the Zionist wants to cook to the Jew it wants it Zionist beg please let me
[18:18] cuck to a Jew is there a Jew in the house we have a cucking emergency on aisle three please respond why because zionists worshiped the
[18:31] scapegoat the technology of the scapegoat is what is being worshiped ye was a billionaire Zionist remember billion dollar Liars maybe it's
[18:47] been too long since I've done that show Kanye could have left the music industry 10 years ago he's not a billionaire if they can take it away the only way reason why they can take it
[19:07] away is because he is a cook for shoes he is a cuck for that he is not a sovereign man
[19:18] and a non-sovereign man would tell you oh my God I got his shoes it's the shoes and this is exactly precisely the exact same chemical injection to the chemical
[19:37] makeup to the adjuvant to all of it involved of Q Anon it's the exact same thing and it's the exact same cue like literal cues c-u-e that Kanye did on the last midterms with
[19:51] Trump this is a man that cucks for attention why because the shoes allow him he is the one receiving and creating
[20:06] that kind of slavery and that slavery requires you to insist that he's a victim because it makes your masochism and your
[20:17] kuckery that much easier by exposure people will praise ye and say ye is right and they will turn around and say the truckers are wrong they're stupid
[20:29] how dare they protest the same kind of thinking in Q Anon Patriots are in control is the exact same sort of fetish
[20:42] to have the zionistic scapegoat as an appetite on the table and you know what sucks about it is that it only works when everyone does it which is why people get so vicious
[20:56] vicious when somebody speaks out against it foreign not sure why this is probably the only Rock was probably the only uh channel that that this this kind of stream would
[21:16] even work on I don't know how this how this is going to be going down but it's really just only one slide it's not a real billionaire neither was Epstein neither is Tim pool neither is Luke
[21:35] radowski but neither is ye stop it I'm having a hard time hanging out with some of you guys knowing that you're believing this [ __ ] I really am because I look around and I see it's us
[21:50] it's not them it's us we beg for this is why we we latched on to the teeth of Q Anon for so long after it was just so silly just so ridiculous we just kept
[22:04] latching on and Kanye this this is three years ago replayed people don't get it because they don't understand the Zionism that's underneath it colander it is colander day
[22:20] pretty stoked about this tomorrow ladies and gentlemen tomorrow there's not a live stream but tomorrow we get to open the Advent calendar the Advent calendar will be
[22:34] open tomorrow as the being the first of December I'm really stoked about that I really look forward to that so uh yeah stay tuned for that stay tuned for that by the way if you're buying a book you're going to get a piece of candy
[22:48] I'm just saying I got I got 30 pieces of candy in here 31. and if you buy a book from me you have to buy it from day true because I don't do Amazon shipping but if you buy it from Jay true you'll you could get a show candy you you could get one so yeah happy
[23:03] calendar day and thank you for sending this in [ __ ] mom oh man everyone is desperate for someone to blame yeah they are and Stephanie what's important is it's not wrong scapegoat technology is not wrong I'm
[23:16] not trying to say I'm not trying to say no one should fart I'm not trying to say no one should ever cough or burp scapegoat technology is how we expel energy and you'll find that most of the live streamers are simply helping the viewer
[23:30] expel energy so they're they're vibrating just like me it's exactly the same I'm vibrating a certain frequency that's going to allow you to expel energy or allow you to learn to sit more comfortably with the energy you have or even gain energy right it's you're an
[23:45] antenna you're an antenna and and I'm setting the the the downward downward beats of my trough as much as I am the upper Beats by talking about uh this kind of hypocrisy
[24:00] that I think it's fine to to to look at Christians and say why are you allowing this on your watch why and I'm competing with someone else it's
[24:14] like oh this dude's a loose Ferris uh Satanist Satanist fern looks Fern is what one of them said uh on Instagram and and I was like wait a minute am I am
[24:29] I Satan is a loose fear and he's like it doesn't matter because because you don't it doesn't matter because you don't believe in objective morality that's what you don't believe in that actually he misspoke that but that's what he meant
[24:43] and I realized wow so this dude like has relative language relativity he's like yeah Satanism lose fairness but it's all the same what does he mean you're my scapegoat you are my escape goat my only
[24:57] Skype goat you make me happy when I Blame You you would lose the fair again and a Satanist cause I believe in objective morality
[25:11] Romans 13 1 and and I have to be more compassionate oh I'm pushing my eyes in because it releases the tension from your poly Vegas
[25:24] but uh this is why sunflowers are here man this is what it's like if you want to rise you gotta rise right this is what's going to happen I I am under attack now we've lost uh
[25:38] how many is it we actually lost 51 [Music] and then uh yeah after the the attack we we went
[25:52] down 49 46 we went down but now we're we've gained five since the attack so and I I expect it'll probably get worse because we'll they'll be looking for a
[26:07] scapegoat we'll be like we need we got a bunch of something to burn it's like but we burned all the trees Clint we done burned them all it's like you find me another tree and he's like well we've burned the shrubbers we burn
[26:20] bushes we burn trees we burn pallets we've been burning tires and and everybody's getting sick Glenn I think we need to stop burning things we will burn something we will burn something
[26:35] [Music] I am the underscore right right it's it's there's it's uh no offense I'm just quiet but I'm pretty sure underscores like a good guy so he's like a an arch
[26:48] Arch filling we'll figure it out we'll figure it out um um yeah see that's great leaving spiers was talking [ __ ] about James for hours the other night exactly I I I've been
[27:06] telling a lot of people about this that that when when you have enough Vortex when your message has enough Vortex it forms this outer bubble of support that's the first thing and it's golden it's like this golden bubble of support
[27:19] my patrons holy [ __ ] and it's like and sometimes there's an outer this other bubble is when it has more of a kind of thing and it's darker
[27:32] it's darker and when people see that they're like oh my God you're so dark you're so dark oh God he's so dark and then they write about how dark it is and so then they weave it darker so they're turning this they're turning it Cobalt
[27:46] they're turning it this rich rich [ __ ] Cobalt in this really deep scary [ __ ] red like the kind of red that's like thick from the experience of going all the way in your capillaries and
[27:58] that's that's anti-dojo is what I call that and I've been practicing learning how to hold that energy for years I have not been good at it ask around the dojo it's been freaking obscene how poor I've been at learning to keep this energy but I
[28:13] talk about it all the time because I want to incorporate that into my field I want that I I think it's great because if I give people that Avenue to beat their stick
[28:25] against my tree it really just makes me stronger I really just end up with like a strong as [ __ ] trunk because as I have it they're just like you're a luciferian
[28:37] and after a while I realize damn that didn't hurt can can you call me that again there's like you're a luciferied and I'm just like damn that didn't hurt at all and you start to look at this energy
[28:54] you start to say my God Owen has been like licking his hands and like rubbing me like a kitten all these all this kind of [ __ ] has been people that have been like dude you were too bright we're trying to
[29:08] trying to smooth you out and really they're fluffing me they've been they've been secreting their witness and rubbing it in in my in my my Dark Places
[29:22] it's kind of weird right and that's why it it used to feel so biting that used to feel biting to me but I've learned to alchemize that energy I've learned to have place for it
[29:36] and to realize it's honor and you know what happens when you when you start to honor energy people give you they keep watching and they'll keep watching and they'll they'll think oh well it has to be
[29:50] because you're a lose firing so they watch because and they want to contribute so they keep that up it's why no one actually can find out what Owen is mad at me for it's it same with rose
[30:03] see same with grow all the things that Crow apparently said have now been taken off it's instantly that message just isn't there there's no apology there's no hey sorry for the mix-up it's just we're going to pretend like we didn't say that
[30:17] and if I rejected that I would be rejecting this this is Crow energy I would want that in my field Thanksgiving as I'm eating we're outside I look straight up
[30:34] and there's a red-tailed hawk being harassed by two crows and he's just like yeah man you crows are beautiful I mean I'm going to keep circling
[30:46] but right on guys good to see you welcome to flight 177. right we'll uh flying to Rhode Island on 5-5 and they're calling the whole way don't
[30:59] you do that stop you can't do that no no no no no no and all that's doing is giving me this beautiful escort they're making it impossible for me to to back down
[31:14] and so what really what's happening with all of this these these attacks with all the biting is people are saying man we [ __ ] believe in you we believe in you so much we're not going to make it possible for you to fail
[31:31] scary stuff I'm literally gonna get on stage and entertain people live in a three-act play it's a literal Play It's Gonna it's a lot of
[31:44] a lot of cool stories in here a lot and and they deserve a bigger audience and I was a I was an idiot I was committing emotional pedophilia by waiting for those people to say hey we should uh
[31:58] we should maybe we should maybe consider James with a little bit more clarity and Consciousness because after all we were talking aperture and saying yeah I believe in aperture too for like eight months and the whole time they're
[32:13] beating that tree and the whole time I realized look at all those beautiful calories they're putting in look at them look at that Owen has said more about my my dick than anyone else in the world
[32:25] that dude is just all over that Osiris he's my Isis and this energy is supposed to be scary this energy is supposed to come from what you might perceive as an enemy

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
32:38] because that's the only way the timber of the sound can carry the right semblance of reality it has to have this sort of underscore tone
[32:52] [Music] right I am the underscore everything that people tell you has this sort of tone
[33:06] and you're the one you're the one that's decided oh I don't like that oh I don't like it when they call me that oh he called me something oh oh no he called me a name oh James is
[33:20] saying I'm I'm a Zionist and I'm a cook oh no oh no and you're like I'm gonna run away and do a stream about what a bad guy he is and and and that's exactly showing how powerful what I just [ __ ] said was
[33:39] the space between the notes that's where you put all your Prana my friends that's where you put all your Prana you see the space what do you do with that you put your weed in there you put your prawn in there that's what the
[33:53] space between all the notes is look you put your Pawn in here look you put your prawn in here look you put your prawn in here how authentic is your shine right there's captivating and then there's authentic these are two very different
[34:08] things very different moths will will love the The Moth light the bug Light zap the [ __ ] out of them right these are different
[34:21] agreements that we have with our world you have an agreement with me until you don't right yeah and everyone loves James idea until he takes their scapegoat away that's
[34:37] what happened with Q Anon and and um I think it's I think people are left realizing [Music] how effective they are as their own scapegoat and they're offended because I I saw
[34:58] them naked I've been doing this a while I've been doing this since I was two seeing seeing stuff like this in other people and just saying it I've had a lot of practice at this I knew I [ __ ] about
[35:15] how art is because it still bothers me but I've had a lot of practice doing this and most of that practice was shot down with no you don't know what the [ __ ] you're talking about or you little Satan kid or whatever else it was it was just always the dismissal like that but I've always just seen stuff and regardless of
[35:30] what they say typically when I see it just it ends up happening and it's just like yeah it's after a while you can't really abandon that and say I don't have this perception anymore
[35:44] and when you think about what makes a what makes a witness intimidating I'd like you to picture that that good witness is is x-ray glasses like from the back of a comic book
[35:59] that when you have good when you have good witness you have no choice but to see all these layers and I I submit a lot of melanin into my
[36:12] own Vision I I purposely hide I do not want to see things in certain people certain people that that I want to believe in I will I will melanate I will block out certain signs of their behavior that are
[36:26] showing me something's wrong so I'm not trying to say that I I have this down I I clearly don't but I I will say that I do have it down what I see
[36:39] I don't have down how much I block and so I will misconstrue things I will uh take things personally I will all kinds of behavioral problems will come in there absolutely and in addition to that
[36:53] I typically can see someone behind their clothes and I say that because I want I want you to feel that sort of vulnerability just to understand what it's like to to see like this
[37:07] and when I say that it's not a special thing that I have I I know you have this too I know you do and not only do you have this but I think
[37:20] hear me out I think that when you do it you find it painful until you stop and the reason why you find it painful so you stop is because you start to notice that that they change when they see how much you see them
[37:39] and that not only do they change sometimes they become energetically violent why because they feel that you violated their their intimate places
[37:53] they feel that you saw the naked that you that you peaked up their dress and it insults them because they're living in a world where that's not supposed to happen you understand
[38:08] and they're trying to imagine now having to go through the rest of their world navigating the whole time that they have this skirt that's always open and that from a certain angle I'm always going to be seen
[38:20] and it's just too much for them and when you're looking at scapegoats typically the very first scapegoat will be the one that sees this well but it sees that that when I told you what I saw about
[38:36] Owen it's because it was true it's because it's there and when I tell you what I see about ye it's the same thing those two have the same thing and neither are better or worse because
[38:53] these are people and I want to love Humanity so do you which means if I find myself really mad like I was at the start of the show I have to alchemically work at
[39:05] satisfying my posture not not changing them but satisfying my posture to know it's my fault that I'm scapegoating it's my fault that I have these expectations on how these people should behave that's
[39:18] the emotional pedophilia and these same people are typing you don't know what what really means because because you're a pedophile they'll type that and I'll be like okay so you're basically saying you reject any kind of ownership that you might be
[39:34] committing emotional pedophilia right now is what they're saying but they're doing it for Memorial High Ground insisting that well I'm the one I've got moral objectivity Romans 13. Romans 13.
[39:46] and that's a real life person and you go in the Navy when you go in the military when you go into any kind of like large regimental thing like that where people are learning to be Sovereign you're going to see those
[39:59] kinds of appetites and you're either gonna smother from it or you're gonna you're gonna satisfy it and keep going you're going to become their horse you're going to become
[40:14] the very people that you pretend to blame trying to go back hang on right Kanye could have gotten out of Music five years ago he could have gone solo
[40:33] and if you couldn't have done it five years ago he could have renegotiated his contract to say in three years he's allowed to go solo and if he couldn't do that he would have wrote a song about it and free Britney is free Brit ye which
[40:49] is free Q Anon which is the world is not our problem and that the zionists that I literally go to church with every day because I feel holy that they get a pass because they're
[41:05] sitting next to me that's disgusting it is it's pathetic and disgusting and we've declared war every 1.3 years
[41:19] can you see why it's important to call me a luciferian can you see why it's important to insist I'm a Satanist it's because who else are they going to point at seriously
[41:32] who else the Democrats they don't satisfy the scapegoat anymore why because the horror has been she's full it's a very crude joke but the horror is
[41:46] full do you understand you can't you can't go back to that same kind of stuff you got it you got to come up with a cleaner crevice and so the luciferian comes in or
[41:57] whatever else comes in anyway shown on the screen is a uh slide of our local Mexican restaurant used to be a Chinese restaurant instead of painting over a mural they just put sombreros on
[42:10] the pandas and I freaking love this it's brilliant brilliant it's beautiful and most importantly it's it's the principle of 40 percent that that it took 40 effort to decide we
[42:25] will paint sombreros on these pandas and it would have been a Zionist that would have been we have to whitewash all of this we have to whitewash all of this and consecrate this place as a Chinese as a Mexican restaurant
[42:40] Mexicans don't have that Zionist [ __ ] they don't it's the Christians that have that it's the Christians that are like oh my God I believe in the promised land more than you
[42:54] and the Zionism is the bombs the Zionism is also chasing these ideas that it's the elite that are placing their children in yellow school buses and sending them off to school
[43:09] because if you can say it's the elite doing it then it doesn't [ __ ] matter you don't [ __ ] care what really happens because this is the best we can do and the reason why it's the best we can do is because the [ __ ] luciferians
[43:22] are making us do this it's the perfect perfect cop-out perfect scapegoat the most perfect magical thing a Christian could do that's why they insist we don't we don't practice Magic
[43:34] we don't practice we don't practice magic we got a holy ghost though and you can eat his his body and drink his blood but we don't practice no magic around here now on Easter I want you to find some
[43:48] eggs you know Ishtar and now Christmas we don't have this uh this uh Pagan ceremony with the lights but we don't practice no magic now
[44:01] we don't do that because we're not a loose fairing we're not and I and I I'll say this again I don't want to take away the shame of of those labels I know for a fact if you came through that waterfall right there's like a
[44:17] waterfall and there's a cave behind it and having those labels is you walking through that waterfall I know if you've come through that I know the only way the only reason why
[44:30] you came through that is because you're ready and that's why James True has changed his message blueprints of and blueprints of mind control something three years ago which I think is really beautiful that I have these steps documented on how this goes
[44:49] up I was more bent on exposure but but that's what we're doing with Yi we have to expose Hollywood we got to expose Hollywood because Hollywood runs on exposure and if we feed them the very
[45:03] thing that they run on it will kill Hollywood and we will have Zion wood we will create Zion wood before our very eyes by exposing Hollywood using Hollywood do you understand James of course you don't understand because
[45:18] you're a luciferian that's why you don't understand me and James 40 guys no one's on a crusade no one should be on a crusade surprisingly people in the retina do have the crv-2
[45:32] protein cryptochrome that is necessary to detect magnetic fields that proteins can theoretically sense however it seems that our brain has no way to decode this information the vision of magnetic fields is somehow
[45:47] disabled probably because it would make our vision a visually stunning but might be unnecessary for survival according to Nature magazine I've been talking about this a lot that you're perceiving through a central
[46:01] source the first eye and that all of the different Avenues of Dimension that we have sound light digestion is a dimension music is a dimension touches a dimension
[46:14] that all these dimensions are simply the pyramid Source coming into the pyramid and it breaking into all these different dimensions at the same time and that once you have enough electricity and it's already happening my friends it's already happening now
[46:28] because you and I already see auras that we are rendering auras from our own compassion in our retina walls and when I watched the guy say well you're Experian I look at it more as like oh my God this
[46:43] pigeon's about to to land on my on my knee it's a completely different interaction and that comes through compassion I'm seeing the aura and I'm realizing there's no red belt there's no danger
[46:58] completely safe from any sort of expectations that I've placed on him to to evaluate myself right or to give myself justification this is what the Sovereign man is
[47:11] he doesn't have another name he populates his own name because he's ready he's come through that threshold right he's coming through that place hello Elon Musk
[47:30] paid 44 billion dollars for Twitter and if you don't know this it's said that he paid four times as much as it was worth and that he tried to buy it or he said he would buy it then they held him to it then he said he didn't want to buy it
[47:45] and then they took him to court or threatened to take him to court and then he did buy it and that all of this in my opinion was a smoke screen and that smoke screen was used to drain the economy and it's not the only smoke screen it's not the central smoke screen
[47:59] and there's not even a central player here I'm telling you that when you invest in someone who is a billionaire Zionist just like ye that musk will say and do anything to
[48:13] preserve that position is cuck and muskuct out right when he claimed a Tesla was orbiting the Earth and apologies for not having the pictures here but if you go back to my
[48:29] Tesla streams I mean yeah to the must streams you'll see that the actual photographs of of the uh of the car pretending to float in Space the the round table geodesic dome that films those are are released on the
[48:43] internet and that's how you test to know does your horse truly belong to you can you actually even publish this this is why Epstein island has a painting of of Bill Clinton in a dress
[48:59] it's the title of ownership because if you had an actual photo or actual video of Bill Clinton in a dress in Monica Lewinsky's dress you would understand that someone has been compromised this is why 911 Trump
[49:14] is in the 911 Serta commercial giving the AOK to 9 11. that's an initiation because the people that are taller than than you or I are energetically are the people
[49:26] that that some of us will call Elite but those people have such a flex that they they don't own companies they own people humans
[49:42] humans themselves are the livestock and you own this livestock by owning a title on someone and that title is could be a painting it could be a photograph
[49:53] it could be a an initiation ritual it could be them kissing a Taxidermy goat in a bow tie it could be you changing your name and going to Hollywood
[50:08] to make it on a sitcom it could be going to Hollywood and Performing exactly as they told you exactly what they told you exactly when they told you seeing all of their psychologist all of their fashion
[50:22] seeing everything be told to you over and over showing you the only way you can succeed is by submitting to this Sensei and that's Sensei and that's Sensei and all of these things end up
[50:35] creating the perfect vessel for these kinds of things to bloom and musk is the perfect fruit he's the perfect vessel to be used he's predictable he's exposed
[50:50] he's completely under the control of those who own him this man owns him this is Larry Ellis I would argue that Larry Ellis is a true billionaire
[51:09] I would argue that Elon Musk is not I would argue that the reason why Larry Ellis is a true billionaire is because you don't actually know much about Larry Ellis Larry Ellis owns Oracle
[51:22] Larry Ellis owns every single database engine that's ever been made on the planet Larry Ellison would would be someone that we would talk about on high Magic
[51:35] or a podcast he's a man who who is on a different kind of plane he doesn't have a birth certificate he doesn't have a Social Security number musk does
[51:49] Epstein does these are Pawns they're traded on the open market they're Thoroughbred so we've talked about this before so is Brittany they will never they will never change
[52:05] and the people that are falling in love with them are trying to convince you that professional wrestling is real because if they can convince you that professional wrestling is real they get to keep their scapegoat and blame everyone else for their own [ __ ]
[52:19] because they get to go home at night knowing I am not Andre the Giant or I am not uh I don't know I can't think of any bad wrestling names right now
[52:34] but that the only way politics could succeed is by exposure and the only way they're going to get exposure is by out whoring what they were yesterday it's the only way and you're surrounded by people that
[52:48] that don't care and because they don't care you're watching people drain and buy people like they would a salad bar they're buying pieces and chunks of humanity
[53:04] and when you collapse in the economy you don't want to scare the cattle you don't want everybody to freak out so what do you do you announce all of a sudden that Twitter no longer has a verification system now
[53:17] and then you have these stories where people are accidentally able to break into Twitter and claim that their Eli Lilly and Company and announced that we are excited to announce insulin is free now and this is looting you're watching
[53:30] looting happen and the zionists the zionists are the ones throwing the chairs into the windows because they're like [ __ ] yeah Eli lilis what's the name of the company Eli yeah Eli literally sucks they're the
[53:47] course they're the realm they're the problem so we're gonna laugh we're gonna laugh when we should be paying the [ __ ] attention but we're gonna laugh instead because they're getting it they're getting it
[54:01] Elon Musk is sticking it to him he's not sticking it to him he's literally draining everyone's retirement account in a sink in a synchronized event in a synchronized event that that proved he was he was someone's [ __ ] because he
[54:15] bought probably a pretty old outdated company for four times its value because he had no choice because someone owned him and said if you do not do this you will be exposed
[54:30] and the only way you can say being exposed is to expose yourself which is why when someone calls you a luciferian you say oh hit Me Harder Daddy show me my luciferian ways show me my luciferian way surely my loose and then
[54:44] all of a sudden you're like wow it just doesn't doesn't do anything for me can you call me you know whatever the next the next term is right
[55:01] it wasn't just Eli Lilly was it look at what happened to Eli Lilly stock this is permission to sell without panicking someone in the chat right now has got to be going dude dude you [ __ ] nailed it of course someone I know has got to be
[55:16] doing that because this is so easy to see now it's so easy and it wasn't just Eli Lilly this was a drain of the economy without freaking out the normies Tony Blair George Bush I miss killing
[55:29] Iraqis what happens Lockheed someone uh hacks Lockheed he will begin halting all weapons sales to Saudi Arabia Israel and the United States until further investigation into the record of Human Rights abuses and of course everyone's like yeah because the
[55:43] Jews the shoes the shoes were finally exposing the shoes we're finally exposing the shoes and they're not exposing the shoes they're not the drop in lockheed's stock price sorry
[55:57] I thought I had a slide on that look just like the drop in Eli excuse me same kind of thing exact same kind of cover story they don't really have a choice what do I mean you guys already
[56:30] there's like barely a blip when they say waynell Sexton barely a blip at all and when we see our own power we understand our power is our attention and when they have a blip of anal sex and no one
[56:45] notices it shows you how how they have no idea they have no choice but to reality television themselves which means you have to always up the ante right Q Anon billionaire submarine right
[56:59] pedophiles satanists underground children's cannibal Factory uh all that stuff right meeting in secret uh somehow sponsored by In and Out Burger holy [ __ ] what a what what a win
[57:13] for them right you have these sponsored reality terrorism Ops that that really in the entire government is that it's never been anything different it's not even rotten to say that what's rotten is to think that this was the only time
[57:28] what's rotten is to look at Kanye and say he's gonna he's gonna blow it right open you guys watch nobody leave nobody leave he's getting ready to bust him with the chair I'm calling you he's going to bust open The Chew the shoes with a chair
[57:45] and you start to realize who here who here is to blame if you really are really looking for that if you're really looking for that scapegoat because you just need that energy
[57:59] who the [ __ ] is making this happen who the [ __ ] is buying these tickets who because yeah he just hit him with a chair Tim pool just hit Kanye with a chair but you're you're the [ __ ]
[58:14] watching you're the dude that feels like you've got it all solved because any minute now someone's gonna pull off Tim pulls beanie and we're gonna find out that Kanye was a secret underground Hulk Hogan this
[58:29] whole time and I find it disgusting Georgia Satellites in the middle of Tchaikovsky it's just like so so not the timber of where we could be
[58:47] that's a arrogant thing to say but I said it anyway I still I still believe it because it's true it is let's see what we got here
[59:05] the less you catch on the more the game is forced to wink do you understand it's gotten so bad that we have to do this that we have to dress a man like a like a
[59:19] a Love Boat sea captain like a female Love Boat sea captain and we got to take a dude and put him in a dress and shave his head like a [ __ ] Conehead and someone said in the Airship man it's
[59:34] like be so afraid something happened to her because the spiders would come out of her head Patrick Hollywood we are looking for you you just came to chat no you're not in trouble People Patrick Hollywood is not in trouble
[59:47] but uh we are looking for you Patrick um for the circus we need to we need to get that if you've emailed me before please forgive me but I'm giving you my email now
[01:00:02] and uh we just need to be able to to get a hold of you um but but the uh the less you catch on the more the system's forced to wink and that's what's so beautiful about the system it has this built-in winking that
[01:00:15] winking happens through kuckery the uh thanks to Yi being a cook he's he's allowing that evacuation to have the the uh the message of vitriol to automatically take over his field and insert it into the soil it's kind of
[01:00:29] beautiful how this whole system works the less you're paying attention the more vitriol you're going to inject into the system and when you look at it that way you start to realize holy [ __ ] we're trapped because we are
[01:00:44] we are you have a witness Cannon coming from your eyes and wherever you look it grows and you can't turn it off all you can do is control what you want to grow and what you don't want to grow

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:00:57] and you can't turn it off and when you sleep at night you wake up every morning and you say [ __ ] what did I Witness because you know all that Witnesses Cuts you now and it just grew and grew and grew and grew and grew and it wouldn't stop and this is where most people get off
[01:01:13] and they're like can I just be a cuck and sadly the answer is yeah you can all you got to do is blame the shoes all you got to do is blame the luciferians all you got to do is listen to someone tell you whose fault it is
[01:01:25] and say yeah what that guy said just like I'm doing with zionists now just like I'm doing now it's witness Canon you can't turn it off no matter where you look that's going to grow
[01:01:46] and there's not a [ __ ] thing you can do about it except for die it's the only way it's the only way and so you are in a if you want to look at it like a prison fine look at it like a prison put it on your little nipple clamps and say I'm in a prison oh my God
[01:01:59] fine go ahead go ahead but it doesn't change the fact that everything you look at is going to grow everything and if you're looking at me and you're smearing me with your cat paws you're
[01:02:13] making me grow and the only way that I shrink is by shedding the energy you just gave me it's the only way I shrink you don't make me shrink you can't look at me and make me shrink you can't
[01:02:27] all I can do is take the way you look at me and lose energy all that's me I am my own scapegoat it's terrifying it's terrifying I feel guilty all the
[01:02:41] time what kind of what kind of demon seed have I have I awoken today by being in a [ __ ] mood right that's what you think now you're walking around going [ __ ] I gotta get in the right attitude why
[01:02:55] because I'm going to unleash the eye of Sauron upon my my neighbors and I don't want to do that and so you have no choice but to keep finding your posture and liking your posture and finding your posture locking your posture because it's just the responsible thing to do
[01:03:10] you're walking around with a [ __ ] elephant gun and it's loaded [ __ ] it's loaded it's loaded it's how powerful your witness Cannon is it's that powerful so of course people are going to say get
[01:03:25] me out of this I don't want this I can't do this of course people are going to say that of course they are they're absolutely going to say that and they're going to assemble like a bunch of hyenas licking each other's wrong because they come up with the best excuse for their
[01:03:38] witness Canon right and they sublimate it out and they give it to a central person and they see this is the dude this is the one that's it because it helps them and so you start to realize that the fountain is going to be something that helps people
[01:03:56] government is always helping people do you know why because government doesn't have a choice think about how [ __ ] it is for these people to walk around saying government plans all this stuff and shows it to us
[01:04:11] and we just follow along do you realize how debasing and debilitating that is to you as a human to insist that it's government that decides everything about what you eat when in fact the entire time you
[01:04:25] know for a fact that if you put up a brussels sprouts stand right next to a Cinnabon that the Cinnabon would win and you're saying it's the fault of
[01:04:39] Cinnabon but it's not it is the appetite around you and the food court is the government they will serve what sells and they will have no choice because they value and only
[01:04:52] survive off your attention which means if they try and give you brussels sprouts and insist it's good for you and just demand that it's because it's the truth they will go out of business and a new government will form called send a [ __ ] bun
[01:05:06] and it will be run by these two and it will have no choice but to survive because that is what the appetite insists and the Zionist will insist this isn't the case because the zionists is the same as the
[01:05:22] person that says if we pass a law then people will stop and until we understand ourselves this will remain our reality right now people are freaking out because there's
[01:05:45] a goat or a stag or a ram whatever you want to call it or a Baphomet on a Christmas card and I'm here to tell you I think that they have to do that now I think the only way they can get you to
[01:06:00] look at the [ __ ] Christmas card is to put this [ __ ] on there because they know for a fact that Rampage 95 trademark who's verified is going to save the world by exposing what they do
[01:06:16] which means the less you catch on the more they are forced to wink it only makes it go louder and [ __ ] louder and [ __ ] louder
[01:06:29] until it just becomes too infuriating for the hyena to keep insisting it's not there literally giving zelinski the Oscar for acting
[01:06:40] by an actor who literally is working for the CIA these are the same these are the same we'll talk about the demons later um we have a Airship tonight at 7 p.m that's in 21 minutes
[01:07:03] um you're welcome to come we have interviewed 10 people for the vitrielle orchestra pretty psyched about that um if you don't know over 45 people have volunteered to help with five five and
[01:07:14] uh uh we have a a pretty large team a symbol to to dilate you on May 5th and only one of those things one of the many things that will dilate you will be my live show
[01:07:26] uh it's show uh made for for the stage and uh I I am nervous and looking forward to showing it to you both at exactly in both amounts I'm equal to both of those
[01:07:41] and it's at a nice time right now where if you were to buy a ticket now Not only would you save a lot but it would really help us determine exactly how big our show can be
[01:07:54] so if you want to save some money and you want to help out then there's a link to buy the ticket we have had we have nine [Music]
[01:08:08] we have to tell you go to the Google Sheets we wanted tickets we have one two three four five six seven
[01:08:25] [Music] we have seven miracles what is a miracle seven people have bought tickets and said I can't come but I want I want you to have a miracle which which means that there are seven
[01:08:39] free tickets of for grabs if you want to come to Rhode Island someone has actually bought you a ticket because they believe in the show this is a limited show the maximum amount of people that we could possibly allow due to due to
[01:08:53] certain uh the facilities capabilities is 250 that's the most we can have I do not know if James True is is someone that would even uh uh have uh no thank you Nate uh are you
[01:09:08] playing the background music on purpose I don't hear the background music that's what sucks let me see if I can oh wow that's [ __ ] creepy isn't it I am the underscore [Music]
[01:09:26] I can't get it to stop how long has that been there long time huh it's day or two underscore underscore did this he's the one that did this
[01:09:41] [Music] thanks Nate I can't get it to stop there's strings there that might have stopped is that better or did you like it better with the music how long was that on do I want
[01:09:59] to know I don't want to know do I three minutes oh man hours it just stopped for a second and came back it should be off now I bet it's off now spectral's laughing her ass off I'm
[01:10:10] glad somebody's founding that funny damn what was I even saying man I was really trying to talk about this thing too you're good now thanks Nate [Music] yeah I didn't do that on purpose that
[01:10:25] that's not at all what I did on purpose wow he's loose for her and James you're so dark and there I was playing that music man I bet that was super dark um but yeah yeah we we uh
[01:10:37] uh I don't even know what my last pulling was except for to say I I we will have it'll be a good show even if I make up screw-ups like this but uh I'm as uh nervous about it as I am excited about it and uh I've got some
[01:10:52] stories that I think are going to make you laugh I think they're gonna make you cry I think they're going to make you dilate and I think you're going to realize a lot of things much much of the things that you might get out of my books but you're going to be experiencing in a in a theater setting
[01:11:06] and it's going to be nothing like you've ever seen I I promise you that the we already have the the team in place 250 people Max thank you Justin Jones that is right yeah 250 Max I don't know if I'm if I'm an act worthy of gathering
[01:11:21] 250 tickets I really don't know uh some of you know we we thought we were doing this would grow and it just didn't work out uh there's a lot of drama uh maybe floating around that I encourage you to look at the five five
[01:11:34] Thoth uh stream uh I think you'll find most of that drama has been removed from other sites certain things that were said I think they sort of realized oh that's not actually what happened but I don't want to create anyone else's story
[01:11:48] if you want to insist that I am somehow the dark lord it's totally fine I I'm learning to this energy is good and Synergy is good and it's going to take us all the way to Rob Atlanta it's going to be great so
[01:12:03] I will say that it's possible that I might like to show so much that I want to maybe do it again and only because of how much work we've already we've already put so much work
