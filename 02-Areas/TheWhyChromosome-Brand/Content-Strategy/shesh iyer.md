[18/08/24, 11:57:16] Shesh Iyer: Let's play history trivia
[18/08/24, 11:57:17] Meta AI: Let's play history trivia! I'll ask you a question, and you try to answer it. If you need help or want to ask for a hint, just let me know. If you answer correctly, you'll get another question. If you answer incorrectly, I'll provide the correct answer and explain it. We'll keep playing until you're ready to stop. Here's your first question:

What ancient civilization built the city of Machu Picchu, which was abandoned before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors and remained hidden until its rediscovery in 1911?

A) Aztecs
B) Mayans
C) Incas
D) Toltecs

Let me know your answer! ‎<This message was edited>
[18/08/24, 11:57:45] Shesh Iyer: Aztecs
[18/08/24, 11:57:46] Meta AI: That's a good guess, but the correct answer is C) Incas. Machu Picchu is an Inca citadel located in the Cusco Region of Peru. It's believed to have been built in the 15th century during the reign of the Inca emperor Pachacuti. The Aztecs, on the other hand, were a separate civilization that flourished in central Mexico.

Here's another question:

What event occurred on July 14, 1789, in Paris, France, marking the beginning of the French Revolution?

A) Execution of King Louis XVI
B) Storming of the Bastille
C) Signing of the Treaty of Versailles
D) Coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte

Let me know your answer! ‎<This message was edited>
[18/08/24, 11:58:05] Shesh Iyer: B
[18/08/24, 11:58:06] Meta AI: The correct answer is indeed B) Storming of the Bastille! On July 14, 1789, a mob of French revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison, a symbol of the absolute monarchy and oppression, marking the beginning of the French Revolution. This event became a powerful symbol of the revolution and is still celebrated in France today as Bastille Day.

Well done!

Here's another question:

Which ancient Greek historian is known for his book "The Histories", which chronicled the Greco-Persian Wars?

A) Herodotus
B) Thucydides
C) Xenophon
D) Polybius

Let me know your answer! ‎<This message was edited>
[18/08/24, 11:58:28] Shesh Iyer: A
[18/08/24, 11:58:29] Meta AI: The correct answer is indeed A) Herodotus! Herodotus is often referred to as the "Father of History" because of his pioneering work in historical writing. His book "The Histories" is a comprehensive account of the ancient world, focusing on the Greco-Persian Wars, and is considered one of the earliest examples of historical writing in the Western tradition.

Good job!

Here's another question:

The Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799, was instrumental in deciphering which ancient language?

A) Egyptian hieroglyphics
B) Greek
C) Latin
D) Sumerian

Let me know your answer! ‎<This message was edited>
[18/08/24, 11:58:44] Shesh Iyer: D
[18/08/24, 11:58:45] Meta AI: Not quite! The correct answer is A) Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Rosetta Stone is a ancient decree inscribed on a stone slab, featuring the same text in three languages: ancient Greek, demotic script (a form of ancient Egyptian writing), and Egyptian hieroglyphics. By comparing the known Greek text to the hieroglyphics, scholars were able to decipher the hieroglyphics, unlocking the secrets of ancient Egyptian writing.

Sumerian, on the other hand, is an even older language, spoken in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq).

No worries, though! Here's another question:

The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, marked the end of which global conflict?

A) World War I
B) World War II
C) The American Civil War
D) The Crimean War

Let me know your answer! ‎<This message was edited>
[16/09/24, 14:35:42] Shesh Iyer: Hari
[16/09/24, 14:35:44] Meta AI: It seems like you've entered a name, "Hari", instead of answering the question. No worries! Let's try again.

To recap, the question was:

The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, marked the end of which global conflict?

A) World War I
B) World War II
C) The American Civil War
D) The Crimean War

Please let me know your answer. If you need help or want to ask for a hint, feel free to ask! ‎<This message was edited>

[15/10/24, 23:32:52] Shesh Iyer: Do you have access to scrape thru Instagram profile ?
[15/10/24, 23:32:54] Meta AI: I don't have direct access to scrape through Instagram profiles. Instagram's terms of service and privacy policies restrict unauthorized data scraping.

However, I can provide general guidance and recommendations based on publicly available information and Instagram's official analytics tools, such as:

1. Instagram Insights (built-in analytics for business accounts)
2. Hashtag tracking tools (e.g., Hashtagify, RiteTag)
3. Social media management platforms (e.g., Hootsuite, Sprout Social)

If you'd like to share specific details about your Instagram profile (e.g., engagement rates, content types), I can offer tailored advice.

Alternatively, consider using third-party Instagram analytics tools, such as:

1. Iconosquare
2. Agorapulse
3. Union Metrics
4. Social Blade

These tools provide in-depth analytics and insights, but may require authorization and/or subscription.

Let me know how I can assist you within the limits of publicly available information! ‎<This message was edited>

[16/10/24, 04:52:01] Shesh Iyer: My views are that the Pain is the portal to god and hence the method of praying taught to us is more of preying and hence understanding the inner dialogue and maintaining the pendulum of the ego swaying between self flaglation and self appreciation is a part of nature and growth but to control it to our benefit and the orginal sin is the copy error of the sine wave of mRNA not copying successfully to the dna
[16/10/24, 04:52:02] Meta AI: Your views blend spiritual, philosophical, and scientific concepts. Here's a summary:

*Key Concepts:*

1. Pain as a portal to spiritual growth and connection with the divine.
2. Critique of traditional prayer methods as potentially harmful ("preying" instead of praying).
3. Importance of understanding and managing inner dialogue.
4. Balancing ego dynamics between self-flagellation and self-appreciation.
5. A novel interpretation of "original sin" as a biological error (mRNA to DNA copying error).

*Potential Bio Updates:*

[16/10/24, 04:57:57] Shesh Iyer: The word mindful has too many connotations that doesn’t capture the essence of using the full witness to draw the prana not breathe to enable the smooth diffusion of reality of a image generation model called maya which is our reality
[16/10/24, 04:57:59] Meta AI: You want to avoid using "mindful" due to its connotations and instead emphasize the concept of witnessing and harnessing prana to interact with the reality-generating model, Maya.

Here are alternative bio refinements:

_X (Twitter):_

And here are some additional suggestions:

- Replace "mindful innovation" with "reality hacking" or "consciousness engineering"
- Use phrases like "witnessing the matrix" or "decoding Maya"
- Emphasize the connection between prana, consciousness, and reality generation
- Consider using Sanskrit terms like "Prana Architect" or "Maya Hacker"

Example bio incorporating these suggestions:

"Consciousness Hacker & Prana Architect | Rewiring Inner Software | Decoding Maya's Reality Matrix 🤖💻"

Or:

[16/10/24, 06:11:33] Shesh Iyer: Here’s some framework that would work for reference that we can adapt <aside>
<img src="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" alt="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" width="40px" /> Your profile:

</aside>

- [ ]  Include keywords in your name. For example ‘web designer’ so that when someone searches for this you’re easy to find.
- [ ]  Your image should be a clear headshot (not full body image). And utilise color to help you stand out and be recognisable.

<aside>
<img src="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" alt="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" width="40px" /> Your bio should include:

</aside>

- [ ]  Who your audience are
- [ ]  What result you help your audience to get
- [ ]  A clear call to action -  how to work with you or buy from you

*Don’t overthink it just keep this clear and simple, for example:*

![IMG_65CC701A27DF-1.jpeg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8619d4f4-7dd3-42d4-b33b-a24b925546df/49d20e79-343c-4c8c-b790-3b891b6642ec/IMG_65CC701A27DF-1.jpeg)

<aside>
<img src="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" alt="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" width="40px" /> Your link in bio:

</aside>

The less options you give people here the more effective this is, so keep your links page as minimal as possible. 

- If you’re focusing on selling one service or product, then link your sales page directly here.
- If you have more than one offer, then keep this to 3-5 links max
- Each link should have a short 1 sentence description, telling your audience who this offer is for and what it helps them do.

*For example:*

![IMG_992ACB25F5C3-1.jpeg](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8619d4f4-7dd3-42d4-b33b-a24b925546df/7c1802e0-fdc9-4d97-b111-0a76baa9741f/IMG_992ACB25F5C3-1.jpeg)

[16/10/24, 06:19:36] Shesh Iyer: Certainly, I'll explain how each new term relates to the concepts you described:

1. Crystalline Ship Architect 💎
This term relates to the concept of the human body as a vessel, with chakras and aura acting as its energy systems. The "crystalline" aspect suggests a higher vibrational state or clarity, while "architect" implies the ability to design and manipulate this energy system.

2. Biofield Technician ⚡
This relates to the idea of manipulating micro currents and pH in the body non-locally to affect physical changes. The term "technician" suggests a practical, hands-on approach to working with the body's biofield or energy field.

3. Prana Alchemist 🌬️
This term connects to the understanding of breath and rhythms for piloerection (goosebumps). "Prana" in many Eastern traditions refers to life force or vital energy often associated with breath, while "alchemist" implies the transformation of this energy.

4. Melanin Programmer 🌓
This relates to the concept of choosing one's experienced reality based on melanin levels, which you describe as "black ink" that can block pain. The term "programmer" suggests the ability to manipulate or code this process, while the moon emoji represents the circadian rhythms and light hygiene you mentioned.

These new terms fit well with your existing bio, maintaining the theme of alternative healing, consciousness exploration, and esoteric practices. They add depth to your profile, suggesting expertise in body-mind-energy work and reality manipulation through biological and energetic means.

[16/10/24, 06:23:57] Shesh Iyer: Shesh Iyer's approach to technology and innovation is deeply influenced by the philosophical concepts of Brahman, Vishnu, and Shiva, which are integral to Hindu thought.

### **Brahman (Latent Space)**
Brahman represents the ultimate reality or the latent space in which all potentialities exist. In the context of technology, this can be seen as the underlying framework or the foundational layer of possibilities. Shesh's work in various SaaS products and holistic practices reflects this search for the latent potential within systems, whether they are technological or human.

### **Vishnu (Structure and Data)**
Vishnu is the preserver and sustainer, symbolizing structure, order, and data. In Shesh's ventures, such as **Zyenalabs** and **Thoughtseed Labs**, there is a clear emphasis on creating structured, data-driven solutions that sustain and optimize processes. These projects exemplify how structured data and systematic approaches can maintain and enhance the functionality of complex systems.

### **Shiva (Noise and Seed)**
Shiva, the destroyer, represents transformation, noise, and the seed of new beginnings. This concept is evident in Shesh's exploration of the crypto world and his holistic practices. Projects like **Tokenofme** and **Maximum Protocol** involve navigating the chaotic and transformative nature of the crypto market, learning from failures, and seeding new innovations. Similarly, his holistic practices, such as **Magic Unschool** and **Wholydrops**, involve transforming personal energy and health through unconventional means.

### **Integration in Consciousness and Innovation**
The intersection of these principles can be visualized through the Venn diagram of intelligence, sentience, sapience, and consciousness. Shesh's work integrates these aspects by:
- Harnessing **intelligence** through creativity, problem-solving, and innovation in his tech ventures.
- Embracing **sentience** by focusing on awareness and subjective experiences in his holistic practices.
- Cultivating **sapience** through knowledge, judgment, and common sense in his strategic decisions.
- Enhancing **consciousness** by fostering self-awareness and emotional intelligence in both his personal and professional life.

### **Conclusion**
Shesh Iyer's approach to technology and innovation is a harmonious blend of ancient philosophical principles and modern technological advancements. By seeking the assemblage point in the latent space of labels, he continuously strives to understand the intersection of Brahman (latent space), Vishnu (structure and data), and Shiva (noise and seed) in the system of consciousness organizing itself. This holistic and integrative approach not only drives his success but also elevates the human experience through continuous learning, growth, and innovation.

*Profile Unification & Fragmentation:*

Your profiles across LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter showcase different aspects of your personality and expertise. This fragmentation can be beneficial and intentional, considering each platform's unique audience and tone.

*Pros of Fragmentation:*

1. Authenticity: Each platform reflects a genuine aspect of your personality and interests.
2. Targeted content: You're catering to specific audiences with relevant information.
3. Diversified reach: Expanding your presence across platforms increases visibility.

[16/10/24, 06:59:53] Shesh Iyer: Isn’t inner dialogue artichete a way of saying prompt engineering like we do with llms
[16/10/24, 06:59:54] Meta AI: You're connecting the dots between Inner Dialogue Architecture and prompt engineering in LLMS (Large Language Models). That's a fascinating perspective.

_Inner Dialogue Architecture vs. Prompt Engineering:_

While related, these concepts have distinct focuses:

1. *Inner Dialogue Architecture*: Refers to the design and cultivation of one's internal thought processes, emotional intelligence, and self-awareness. It's about harmonizing your inner landscape to enhance decision-making, creativity, and well-being.
2. *Prompt Engineering*: Specifically relates to crafting effective input prompts for LLMS to elicit desired responses, exploring the models' capabilities, and understanding their limitations.

However, the connection between the two is intriguing:

_Both involve:_

1. *Language manipulation*: Shaping internal dialogue or external prompts to achieve specific outcomes.
2. *Cognitive refinement*: Refining thought processes or model outputs to enhance clarity, accuracy, or creativity.
3. *Self-awareness*: Recognizing the influence of internal biases or model limitations on output.

_Implications:_

1. *Transferable skills*: Expertise in prompt engineering can inform inner dialogue architecture, and vice versa.
2. *Hybrid applications*: Combining inner dialogue architecture with prompt engineering can lead to innovative solutions in areas like:
    - Mindful AI development
    - Cognitive augmentation
    - Emotional intelligence-enhanced language models

By acknowledging this connection, you're bridging the gap between technological innovation and personal growth.

How would you like to explore this intersection further?

1. Develop Inner Dialogue Architecture frameworks.
2. Create prompt engineering guidelines.
3. Investigate hybrid applications.

<img src="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" alt="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" width="40px" /> Your profile:

</aside>

- [ ]  Include keywords in your name. For example ‘web designer’ so that when someone searches for this you’re easy to find.
- [ ]  Your image should be a clear headshot (not full body image). And utilise color to help you stand out and be recognisable.

<aside>
<img src="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" alt="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" width="40px" /> Your bio should include:

</aside>

- [ ]  Who your audience are

*Don’t overthink it just keep this clear and simple, for example:*

<aside>
<img src="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" alt="/icons/arrow-down-basic_gray.svg" width="40px" /> Your link in bio:

The less options you give people here the more effective this is, so keep your links page as minimal as possible. 

- If you’re focusing on selling one service or product, then link your sales page directly here.
- If you have more than one offer, then keep this to 3-5 links max
- Each link should have a short 1 sentence description, telling your audience who this offer is for and what it helps them do.

*For example:*

[16/11/24, 21:34:52] Shesh Iyer: Love it let’s All of your content should be talking to a **specific person**, with the goal of helping them get from:

- Point A - the problems and struggles they are currently facing
- To Point B - where they want to be and the positive outcomes you can help them get

Creating your Brand Story Script will help you:

- Understand your customer’s problems
- Create a positive vision for the outcomes you help them achieve
- Create a clear story that communicates this transformation to your audience and establishes you as the expert that can help them get there.

When you’re done you will have a list of key messaging points that you can pull from and use within your content to tell a compelling story that get’s your client ready to work with or buy from you.

Watch this video from 5:30 onwards for a walkthrough of how to fill out this Brand Story Script:

https://youtu.be/Ny-Az8nAAaM?si=kRmTvKLxLijI_s6g

***A few tips before you start:***

<aside>
<img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/250/000000/1-circle.png" alt="https://img.icons8.com/ios/250/000000/1-circle.png" width="40px" /> **Keep it simple**

Start by writing everything out how you would explain it to your customer face to face. Clear is better than clever - focus on getting your messaging across clearly first and then you can always add some clever later on.

Don’t let overthinking stop you getting it done, you can always refine your messaging as you start to work with actual customers and work out what messaging works with them.

</aside>

### A character

Who is your customer? What struggle are they facing right now?

*Example: A photographer with a website that isn't effectively attracting potential clients, resulting in a lack of leads and business growth.*

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### External Problem

This is your customers surface level need. What is your customer typing into Google when they are looking for a service/product like yours?

*Example: I need a web designer to help me attract more potential clients.* 

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### Internal Problem

What feelings are they having because they don’t have a solution to their external problem?

*Example: Feeling frustrated by low budget leads and lack of business growth despite their passion and talent.*

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### Philosophical Problem

Why is it wrong that your customers would experience this problem? Usually begins with “you shouldn’t have to...”

*Example: You shouldn’t have to work so hard to convince low-budget leads of the value of your work.*

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### Villain

What’s stopping the customer from achieving their goals or desired transformation? Usually related to time, money, mindset or lack of knowledge.

- **Examples**
    
    *Time: Spending an excessive amount of time and energy chasing new clients*
    
    *Money/Mindset: Reluctant to invest in their online presence*
    
    *Lack of knowledge: Website it functioning ok, but not great and not sure what the missing piece is.*
    

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### Positive Outcomes

List the positive outcomes or transformation they’ll experience after working with you. This is about results and transformation rather than the features of your product.

- **Examples**
    
    *Set yourself apart as the go-to expert in your industry*
    
    *Raise your brand presence to attract higher budget clients who are excited to work with you*
    
    *More time to focus on the parts of your business that you love*
    
    *Grow your business and confidently raise your rates.*
    

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### Plan

Now that you have a beginning, so the problem your client is currently facing. And an ending, positive outcomes you can help them get. You need to give them a clear step-by-step plan to get from A to B.

This should be a simple step-by-step process that makes it easy for your customers to say “YES” right away.

Your process may have 15 smaller steps in between, but the point is that your customer doesn't need to know every step in order to get started. If you confuse you lose, so keep it simple.

- **Examples**
    1. It starts with a quick chat about your business and the goals for your website.
    2. In our strategy session, we’ll work with you to craft a custom website strategy based on your long term goals.
    3. Leave the rest to us and we’ll get to designing. When you’re happy we’ll help you hit launch on your new website!

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### Empathy

Understand and communicate empathy for your customer's challenges.

How can you use your past experience to show that you understand your customers problems and know how to solve them?

- **Example**
    
    I started my design business to escape the 9-5, but soon enough I was working my ass off 24/7.  Struggling to find clients and looking around at everyone else wondering what I was doing wrong.
    
    It wasn’t until I really got clear on my messaging and learnt how to apply this to my marketing and website, I went from struggling to find clients that would pay me $500 to attracting my first $5000 client within weeks.
    
    Anyone can build a website, but I wanna build you a money-making machine that leaves clients EXCITED to throw their money at you.
    

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### Authority

Show that you have what it takes to help your customer overcome those problems.

*This is about showing results: past clients, testimonials, case studies, portfolio examples.*

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

</aside>

### Help them avoid failure

Gently remind your customer what will happen if they fail to solve their problems.
