[02:30] welcome to the machine my son and the means to escape it my name is Miguel Connor your pompitus ofn nois your yic spray getting rid of that uh smell of
[02:42] kitas rising through well through the air of a world gone mad great to see everybody and we have a very exciting show
[02:54] tonight with us uh it's always an honor and a pleasure to have the the man James True James how are you doing I am fantastic happy Tuesday great to be here good to see you both
[03:08] again likewise and with us we've got the moon dog Vans V how are you doing well Vance couldn't be here so he sent in his clone so here I am luckily we trans transferred all my
[03:21] memories uh into the Clone so I it should be equivalent experience clone or replicant I wonder we got that refence yeah exactly have to do the M km test or
[03:34] whatever PKD I I can never remember that test they do minec mine clone [Laughter] M yeah I know I thought it was so
[03:46] interesting because I enjoyed your book black eye Club great I read it in one evening because again I like the story of course as usual it's sort of fiction and you throw in your philosophies and all that
[04:00] so it was a great re but I was also thinking my God it's also so relevant with the Kate Middleton stuff you know it's uh be a clone is she is this a deep fake is it a hologram is it a body
[04:15] double like you say Jame it's the greatest apocalypse ever so we can pick many conspiracies now right that's right that's right yeah in fact uh really the easiest way to really dive into cloning
[04:28] is to understand and even assume that you are a clone and to begin from that process is the only way I think to fully fathom uh what it means and in writing this book I
[04:41] I've never really woke up forcing myself to consider that I'm a clone and how how I would go about my day and more importantly uh how that would feel to know that there was someone out there
[04:55] that that shared my IP address on the network and that had the same Visions but also the same epigenetic starting point as I did because this really what a clone is is someone who is
[05:07] beginning on a an epigenetic Journey at exactly the same Waypoint with exactly the same character and all the fuel and all the offerings that come with them at exactly the same time and this this is
[05:20] giving us for the first time in you know maybe 12,000 years maybe uh is is giving us for the first time the ability to look at ourselves in the from this perspective I'm talking about and really start to profoundly pick apart some of
[05:34] the some of the gray areas that we've had about what it means to even be human so this this topic is deeper than I thought it would be I'll just say what I thought was a sidebar really turned out to be just the heart of of of the essence of of the ideas in this book
[05:50] yeah right back at Blade Runner and replicant and Philip K dick what it is human what's Consciousness what were you saying Vance yeah what about identical twins that was a they're natural clones yeah have the same genes yeah they sure
[06:03] do and and the uh one one difference I would say not that this is even a difference but one one thing that's interesting about clones is is that the uh identical twins are starting with a a
[06:16] a clean slate on that IP address of their DNA and they're starting it from the moment they're born a clone is is a little bit different because uh let's say that that maybe we should talk about horses just cuz it's just easier to even
[06:31] begin okay that way people know that when I'm talking about horses I I'm claiming that this is factual and you guys can prune my lips just like just like I encourage you always to do but uh so so if you start with like a seven-year-old horse and and I'm not a
[06:46] big horse guy so anyone horse you're going to notice I don't know any of the terms so forgive me I'm not trying to I'm literally an ignoramus when it comes to that but I do know about cloning and when you clone a seven-year-old horse
[06:58] there there there's a certain uh puzzles that have already been solved inside the pituitary of that horse and those Solutions are automatically imprinted in the epigenetics of that uh femur cell
[07:13] the the the or or if you scrape the uterus and you pull out an egg and you you the the nosis inside of that uh of inside of that cell is also
[07:26] duplicatable so something is as like a fetish I'm sorry something like a fear I got to fix this we got to talk about the word fetish sometimes but uh a a totem fear uh that's installed in a piece of
[07:40] of object say a garden hose is going to trigger a horse and the horse is going to be terrified of the garden hose because it had an experience out in front of the barn with this one particular garden hose before that point
[07:53] the the horse had no fear of garden hoses after that point it did this this event changes the genes the genetics of the horse are now different okay and when
[08:06] you when you take that moment and then you clone that you are cloning that fear of snake too that is now Incorporated in the system so yes it's it's as simple
[08:20] the starting point is is it's as simple as identical twins the complex part is is when you are you are cloning something that's already been through the the P AR ladder they've gone through puberty so to speak uh but but in a much
[08:33] more conscious way not necessarily just sexual although that's a huge part of it but just certain parts of their personality their balls have dropped and and and now they're being born into a
[08:44] fresh body but with this psycho uh gender fication that's already occurred and to me this is what what makes it a fascinating uh feel that's bigger than I than I first thought it was but James
[08:59] you were talking about obviously epigenetics which gets passed down which atheism try to erase From Evolution they've been tried very hard but so you're saying that you're a clone because so much has been passed down to
[09:13] you that's identical to your ancestors and other figures in history that's what you're saying you're not nothing new Under the Sun almost yeah absolutely you to to unlock who we are I believe really
[09:27] what we're doing is we're tapping into our ancestors and we're unlocking who they they are because they is us right but in order to understand ourselves we disassociate from our ancestors and we
[09:40] say oh that was my grandfather and that's fine but there's a a point on the meditation mat where you're ohing and you notice I am my grandfather I am the same thing I've had that yeah and and when you associate into this kind of
[09:54] thinking I'm using the word associate because I want you to picture like if you're going to go roller skating and after an hour you've really really just fit into these roller skates they're an extension of you and so your
[10:05] grandparents become you you start to to to function as a larger entity than you were before you're Awakening the halls of these other things and I think cloning is actually going to show us how
[10:19] to standardize that process not necessarily because cloning's good I I think it's more because we're going to we're going to clone ourselves we're going to step out of the dressing room room and and Target we're like oh my God I can't believe I look like this that
[10:33] and they're going to run back inside and it's going to give you a better understanding of who you are I think I I think a lot of The Haunting goes away so I it seems like a lot of who we are is
[10:45] really just epigenetic haunting I use the word haunting because if you look at it as like an algorithmic spell alcoholism is alol could be looked at as an epigenetic uh lingering that occurs a
[11:00] super critical kind of like brain Theory but inside of epigenetics where a flavor or a taste or a habit is invoked simply because we uh see a stream go by or we're dilated by certain things or or we
[11:14] we have a an event uh that that's mimics a trauma that we had but but but I'm using trauma in a very broad term it's more like mimics a dilation that we've had because it's the dilations in the
[11:27] past that haunt us and they haunt us from the side of wisdom and they haunt us from the side of Terror and that both these things are serving us which is why it's important that we start to demonize
[11:39] ourselves in in a more educational way we we we start to associate when I understand the fabric of my grandfather and what he went through in his life I'm sort of able to peel that apart from
[11:53] myself and then understand more about who I am outside of the Clone versus who I was made from because I'm going to I'm going to suggest to you that I'm simply a clone of my grandfather it seems to to
[12:08] weave in between Generations by the way which makes it harder for us to recognize these things and to see these things and I think cloning is going to eventually show us holy cow this is this is how it works so you think that right
[12:22] now we have the technology to clone humans Isa Stepford wives and it's being utilized oh yeah yeah we we I there's no way that that we haven't
[12:36] been doing this since at least the 40s it's it's 40s whoa yeah I I I so I know that that there's a lot of fun truther kind of raise the hair on your back when
[12:48] we start to think about Nazi uh cloning and things like that but I really I really just want you to look at it as uh during the entire time while while um this idea was going on in
[13:02] America the Eugenics movement was uh standardized like 4 AG Club there you literally were like are you going to the Eugenics Baker Bakery yes I am I've made an apple pie and and we really like this
[13:17] color Hue of people and we really like people that are this tall and oh I'm so sorry Meg but your knuckles are not going to make it this year so we're gonna we're going to take yall back and that this this used to be okay because
[13:31] we didn't have enough complexity of civilized Shane to to cril ourselves so we we we outwardly expressed it more and I think that what just as we were doing it in our societal Americas the Daughters of the American Revolution
[13:45] were doing it in their light light kind of ways Venezuela was like we are making a cottage industry out of this technology and it's seriously not that
[13:57] hard it's when I say it's not that hard the success rate of cloning is very low but the technology involved to to begin cloning is very easy it is a low threshold to enter this business you can
[14:12] start it out of a food truck you're basically looking at at at just finding the right cell inside the body you don't even need uh you don't even need a anything out of the uterus you can do
[14:26] this from the femur you can do this yeah and so uh I I could take any healthy adult not me personally I haven't tried this although you know maybe if you know if my book sells I I'll set up a lab but but but you you can take one of those
[14:40] cells and with that same cell you it actually has both parts of the DNA are actually inside of there so really you're just going to take both pairs of those DNA of that single female in this example we can talk about males just a
[14:53] lot more complicated but that we can take both of those genes and in vitro place them inside of a somatic cell that's basically just going to be uh giving life to that genetic code so this
[15:06] would be the Clone you're now cloning that adult but you're cloning that adult so we know from watching horses and I'm so science what we call science watches
[15:21] horses and so the a lot of the science is very easy for you to access and to just see what happens but I feel confident that that certainly uh this would have been a big part of World War
[15:34] II is simply just cloning cloning families in fact you know the CIA has has neighborhoods you know outside of Lindley that they buy and they're you know they're families that live here and I I don't think that you have to go so far as to say are you saying they're
[15:50] cloning them if you want to think that that's fine but I don't even think it's necessary because I think really you're looking at how is your dog trained and what what was your dog did it come
[16:01] haunted with because the bordic col is haunted by I have a strong desire to bring things that are larger than me back into a circle through yelping and directional call this is they are haunted by this and as long as you get a
[16:16] clone that's haunted by that you now have a Bree that's going to be positive so this is why I say The Haunting is we have to understand what haunting really is it's just an algorithmic kickoff where things just kind of kind of kick in so that the same horse that's
[16:31] terrified at the garden hose is also going to kick right out of the gate faster than anything you've ever seen because it has that same fast twitch that it was taught it was taught probably because the horse that was
[16:43] cloned from it had such a dilating I.E terrifying experience that its fast twitch muscles were able to develop more than anything else and so that haunting becomes a necessary part of it which
[16:56] gives it skill so everyone that you see with natural Talent is just possessed right they're possessed by a past and and we want this we we go out to find
[17:10] our ways can we want something to possess us we will join the the Army we will join the Marines because we want to go be possessed by what a horrible experienced War can be all these things prove our metal but also they give us
[17:24] the opportunity I think mostly this is the thing we don't necessarily notice this is the Hades part of it they give us the opportunity to cleanse these things through war and other dilating experiences but we don't consciously understand that secretly I'm terrified
[17:38] of this garden hose and I want to go to the land of garden hoses so I can face my deob fears as a horse right I'm going to go to the land go into the cave that's full of garden hoses and emerge from the other side uh a Victorious
[17:52] horse this is probably what drives us more we're just not consciously aware of it oh well said yeah I think I'm thinking of the famous book that got made into a movie you're talking about
[18:04] cloning The Boys from Brazil and it was a huge uh it was a huge hit and of course that's the idea that Hitler not only escaped or they took parts of them to South America and they cloned them
[18:17] into all these kids and some died most of them died and whatever so and I remember my godmother she was like oh that's not a conspiracy it's true there's lots of H there and yeah then there's a movie that came out last year
[18:31] it's called infinity pool I don't think it's David Cronenberg I think it's his son but it talks about uh cloning and the hor the ethical abuses of people who will clone because then they can do
[18:44] whatever they want so um so like a male a male horse uh ad Doo uh kiasu is a world famous Polo player and uh he won the last maybe not the last po po clup
[18:59] but a a very recent Polo cup uh famously using seven I believe it was could have been six uh the symbolism interesting I I wish I knew I think it was six uh six cloned horses and that that during the match
[19:13] all six cloned horses were used and and you it's quite easy for me to read this story and go oh this is such a a press release like you know that he's obviously they want to push the idea that that they're not hiding it he he's
[19:26] quite proud of it and as I as I read into his story more and all the science is there it's just fascinating what's going on with the horses a couple of his uh medical staff have actually quit
[19:38] because of the ethics they've they've noticed they've noticed these things about clones and this is really what I honed in on it was the guys that were fired from it they noticed these things about clones and they just didn't think
[19:53] it was right and mostly from horses they're they spoke more about the puberty and and although they didn't say this I just imagine that that your pituitary is you know your pituitary is putting out this signal right so it's
[20:07] like it's three signals there there's your daily signal your cicen rhythms of course is just giving you a natural it should be 24 but believe it or not it's 25 hours it's actually trying to make you stretch weirdly your brain is always
[20:21] making you stretch longer than it really needs to be so that's one cycle but then the yearly cycle you know it's just listening to the EnV ironment and putting out you know uh different chemicals during the winter and different chemicals during the Spring
[20:33] and things like that but then a much larger clock is this is this puberty clock that goes off and that your body naturally just uh the cycle
[20:45] completes augra notices the metal gears come into line and boom you know your your balls drop as we say you you you Saturn returns and clunk clunk you hear something and youve now sexualized
[21:00] yourself you have have genderfield become her mafadi these are all three things that are uh built strongly into science that these are the three Avenues these believe it or not there really are three genders I don't
[21:39] mind us calling it two because hermaphrodite is simply you know you're just having both endocrine systems but the point is is that uh your innocence is lost once your pituitary drops and I
[21:52] believe that what these doctors if they had more if they had maybe better eloquence not that I'm eloquently saying this but they they would have said it like that they would have explained that the horses lost their innocence they
[22:06] were never given a chance as a clone to be born into innocence because they were cloned at a point in their life where they had already been here they weren't handed off in a process through the garden and that that gardenary process
[22:19] uh creates a sealed doorway between this life and your life simply because it's giving you a different genetic IP address right the male genes of the sperm and the female genes of the egg
[22:34] are joining in Sex and that those two things create a new IP address and that that new IP address has never had its pituitary dropped but if you clone something that has the same genetic code
[22:49] what I'm arguing is and actually what these guys are talking about is is that there the pitar is already dropped these horses are already acting like their male before before they even know it they can't be kept in the same padic
[23:01] they're they're ready to to produce they're they're months old and they're ready to [ __ ] excuse the language and they don't know why they don't know they don't understand what's going on here and it's it's because the the scientists
[23:15] say it has to be the epigenetics there's there's no other link is what they've said in fact these guys before they quit they wanted to fix this they they believe so so strongly in this clone stuff they're like how do we fix this
[23:30] and they and they just couldn't and when you add that to just the the sheer failure rate which is really high you're looking at you're you're shooting a lot of you're shooting a lot of things in
[23:42] the head and and I I think that that Argentina became a cottage industry for that it's a clandestine country anyway it's literally the one of the top countries where people go
[23:54] missing uh is Argentina there's over 300 camps you could find this on Wikipedia if you wanted over 300 clandestine human trafficking camps have been raided busted or acknowledged there yeah it's more than it's way more than any
[24:09] other place in the world and I believe that you're just looking at the psychosis or psychology I'm not even trying to be judgmental because again I think that if we need to understand this let's call ourselves a clone let's do
[24:22] that and then let's look at at what's actually happening because what's happening is is that you're creating a psychological stalemate and this to me this is what well what this book the main theme of this book I think really
[24:35] is this is that when you have two identities that are sharing the same IP address and maybe we should explain that but when you have that you're going to create an economy where there can be
[24:48] only one where there's going to be a quickening there's just nothing you can do about it and I think that this what really what's unwrapping in this book is that if you just follow morally what's happening there especially when you're
[25:00] looking at a powerful family uh that that's probably the case ad Doo cambiaso this guy that that won with six horses is a billionaire because he's an oil tycoon
[25:12] he's a professional athlete at the top of his game he is a fashion icon he's like bigger than Ral Lauren if you remember who that was like worldwide uh and the guy's like drop dead he's he's a good-looking guy like
[25:28] he's he has he has all the traits of something that would be uh tailored just as anyone who goes to the Westminster to show a dog you would do the same thing
[25:41] with a person and so when you look at this you looking at uh the potential for a group of clones this is what I suggest in the book is that these group of clones are Incorporated they've

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
25:55] Incorporated themselves as a doo and it's seven clones that look alike and that they started off with the same information they with the same starting point and that because they were so rich and successful they incorporated into
[26:09] where all of them had equal shares in the same identity and then that's what decided who they did and so you're watching this war this Civil War play out because the identity is being
[26:23] deteriorated because of really the profound theme in this book is really I think the profound theme of why we're here which is that the the most special thing that you have
[26:37] is your originality your unique identifier your your unique key is actually more precious than all the beautiful things you might do or might say it's the fact
[26:50] that you have this unique IP address on this network that prevents anyone else from stealing feelings that you get to unwrap yourself and that you wouldn't be able to do that and as long as you're living in a world
[27:05] where someone can do that you would have no choice but to either end yourself or end them or come up with some kind of solution because this is not a a way to live this is uh you're being cheated
[27:17] basically is what I think ends up happening really well said indeed and uh yeah uh for the audience if you have any questions for James please Super Chat
[27:30] them so we can separate them and we will we will get to them uh I I had to highlight this comment because this cracked me up was Jesus a hermaphrodite I'm not going to touch it James does talk about I think there you write
[27:45] there's only been 500 instances in human history recorded of true hermaphrodites I would say Jesus is a spiritual hermaphrodite but a true hermaphrodite is a very rare thing isn't it well it is
[27:58] rare but it's it's definitely not unheard of and you're having you're going to have eight uh eight um excuse me I'm trying to think of the word I always have trouble remembering
[28:12] this word but uh you've got you have a a completely different lymphatic system inside of you and that that's being online uh I I as my friend
[28:25] Renee actually pointed out if you think about the story of Mary she's not allowed to have birth in a room in a hotel room they say there's no room at the end
[28:39] but really they're like there's no room for you Mary you are weird you you're going to go have babies where animals have babies you're going to go out to the manger and you're going to have a baby there and when you do that you're
[28:53] not going to need a mother a father to impregnate you you're going to do what a hermaphrodite was it's called selfing a true hermaphrodite can self themselves they it's called selfing it's hilarious but it's like if you want insult her Aphrodite you don't say hey go [ __ ]
[29:07] yourself you go go s okay yeah they're like yeah I just did it yesterday I literally the best Saturday night date man it's like one of the greatest things that I have going for me is that I can go go self myself so so I if if if you
[29:20] want to peel back the idea becomes very difficult to talk yourself out of that idea because of Simply the story of Mary itself the what is a clone it is an Immaculate Conception the entire process
[29:35] of what we're calling this is immaculate conception so uh I when we go back to Adam Cadman if you read my last book araba for example you know that theaphrodite is the origin the original
[29:49] atom where we came from and that there's a royalty that's there see I this book there's a hermaphroditic line that's been discovered and that this woman has tortured her whole [ __ ] life because
[30:02] they worship her because she has all of her parts and and when you're in the room with someone who has all their parts you are going to either lust for them have jealousy of them go crazy over them or
[30:17] want to kill them or want to worship them or just level the [ __ ] up and only one of those six is a good thing for the person and so I think any Herrod in history was just flat out just freaking
[30:31] everyone out around them at all times anyway and so when when you look at what an elite would do if they found that uh if you were were an elite billionaire
[30:42] and you found a hermaphroditic uh uh bloodline I think you would hoard it and I think you would hoard it for a long time and as royalty you you may not necessarily put it out in front but you would want it to be your property would
[30:58] own that bloodline and that there would come a time when an uh when a cottage industry that that practices cloning say Argentina would would want and pay for
[31:12] the most heirloomed human that it could find and I cannot think of a more heirloomed human than a hermaphrodite and so when we look at how we're going to survive the next reset
[31:25] how we're going to undergo a cataclysm it just becomes a natural process for me to think that someone would consider a hermaphrodite a pretty important thing to have right now it's like the world is ending all we need is a her Aphrodite
[31:40] and we can we can fix this whole thing does anyone got a hermaphrodite because I'm gonna go to Kmart you buy as many hermaphrodites as you can and bring them back here because there's going to be a science that's necessary to Time Capsule
[31:53] ourselves and so this book really does wrap up just all of these things in one but it's just set in a Sci-Fi story this way so it's the same research that I give in my in my talks it's just laid out in a story that I hope gives you a
[32:08] more an emotional compassion as to what it actually feels like to be a clone because it's not doesn't really make sense that you would actually have a different name there's a few characters in my book I won't name them because I don't want to spoil the story but but
[32:23] you they they share the same name and you might at first think well that doesn't make any sense but if you really start to dive into this clone stuff you would actually understand why they would prefer to have the same name that there would be a psychology built in that
[32:37] would require them to until they until they Quicken themselves and return back to a solitary again which is the tip of the spere and that's what makes us so special I think is because we are so uh
[32:50] delicate in that way yeah that's why I like the well hero heroine lad because the name I mean I found great character but I found her a Bittersweet
[33:04] tragic because again the name Lita the swan Rap by Z by Zeus by the Olympians but in some stories Lita gets turned into the fierce go goddess Nemesis and she's I saw she's very pale so I'm sure
[33:18] it wasn't an accident you called her Lita no no it wasn't yeah in fact Quantum Rapture uh her daughter is a a main character in that excuse me and uh um with her being in that it uh it was
[33:31] important to give some backstory in this because the sequel uh deals a lot more with Consciousness as being something the deeper you go into the ocean which appears to be Hades in my opinion that
[33:45] that bless that you go into you're getting closer to Consciousness and so Orca uh uh giant squid Megalodon cre
[33:58] like this uh a lot of creatures we we just haven't met yet that are down there leviathans themselves would become uh more angel-like than say going up into space it actually would be the opposite
[34:11] that when we die it it I think what we secretly know this the Oracle mythology I think actually knows this because we decide that when we die we're buried underground and we're buried underground
[34:24] because I think Heaven is actually below like shio is the original name of those who have gone before us it's it's not necessarily the oh and it sucks too it's awful at first it was like those who
[34:38] have gone before us and then it that came to me oh that sounds awful they've gone so clearly that's and it's fine I don't but I'm just saying that the originally it didn't necessarily have this connotation in fact we would Embrace ads something that we would
[34:52] embrace all the time and so if you think about what's happening when we're dying maybe our bone B are there because we're still quantumly entangled so we're buried but we're still in the room our bones are still there all of our loved
[35:05] ones remember us and so by extension parts of us have to remain in this in this space and so they do so the real meaning of death like to truly die would be to release all of your
[35:21] entanglements everyone that's ever haunted you everyone that you've already haunted that when you die you would have the opportunity if you were good at this if you could transmogrify if you could step away and disassociate because to die would be to
[35:34] disassociate from all these Quantum entanglements you wouldn't just sink six feet underground no you keep going you just keep going and going you you you would you would flux through the highest pressure thickest things that
[35:49] ever were in this world because none of them had any tangible hold on you anymore and most of our religious experience erences describe something much like this this
[36:01] uh evaporation I understand that a lot of our stories deal with heaven but I really want people to understand that I think the reason why you've heard that those stories deal with a space that's up above is because of our obnoxious
[36:15] nature at transliterating the word Hades over time and that we ended up having to turn it away because because we had such a fear in Greek culture you didn't say
[36:26] Hades you didn't say that word out loud you you used other words to reference it the same way Jews do that with God right words it's like Hashem and all these other adoni and all these other names that are names but not
[36:40] really the name it's because it's the same thing the but the reason why I think originally we didn't say Hades was not because we were terrified it's because this is the Unseen we have reverence for the Unseen
[36:54] because we are not able to to perceive it we're not able to describe it so we do not talk about it as if we had the glory in our tongues to speak it this is the exact same notion as the name of God
[37:09] where we said you you're not worthy to say the name of God and it would be the same ideas we're not worthy to talk about 80s because it's such a reverence reverential place and and we respect it
[37:23] by not being able to speak about it yeah here's a quote from your book book from I think it's blue man one of the characters Hades is where we deny things out of existence ignoring something
[37:35] doesn't make it doesn't make it go away it makes it invisible see the difference so yeah there's these beautiful uh ideas of Hades that you weave in and out of the book and yeah you
[37:48] know that's it reminds me go ahead well that's just so much has been so much of of this science that we talked about for years with the aperture and things like that too so that's why this book really writes itself the the science seems so built into it that the mythology just
[38:04] suddenly made sense to me all the sudden yeah for sure and yeah made perfect sense and yeah for the audience check out uh our our yes our interview on the Oracle of Mythology because we talk about yeah going down how the
[38:18] merkaba Jews people didn't understand when they took a Mystic flight to the throne of God they went down and people are like why are they going down because that's where that's the holy Place yeah and you see it over and then interesting
[38:32] about the Mayans people don't know what happened to the Mayan empire James and one of the theories is that you know the Mayans when you died you buried your dead in your house you honored they weren't dead they were just in a
[38:44] different state so people thought that eventually they ran out of people and it became a necropolis and don't you think maybe they reached that point where they were in Hades they were again they were
[38:57] release from the karmic debt or whatever and they just vanished yeah yeah and so much of this is that fear and fear was we had to we had to
[39:11] become Advanced enough to fear death that that actually was a necessity to where we finally gained enough calories to where oh my God we can fear death now oh this is going to be great and and when you do that everything changes and you instantly have to hide a lot of
[39:26] things you have to remove a lot of your history that you used to do you know used to come to go over to Miguel's house 40,000 years ago and be you know hey Miguel and he'd be like hey touch my
[39:38] touch my grandparents bones and and this is this is and when you think about uh it's it's almost like I want to write a whole book from this perspective but
[39:51] uh one of the characters in this book has found a a a seed an Aboriginal seed seed a genetic seed from a time of Aborigines and they actually have a place where these aboriginies live
[40:04] because the this Museum's keeping them alive and I was thinking about the the psychology then where everything would be red and black all of the vision that they see would be and that's pretty
[40:18] Advanced they can see black white and red basically and that that red is a new thing and that that red is not necessarily the color in the environment it's the color of what their mind is
[40:31] trying to hallucinate into them to get them to see more information and so when you understand that this is truly how we see things uh not only does it does it profoundly give you an impact into what it was like to
[40:45] be in the past but it starts to allow you to experiment just how blind we are now and just how profoundly we'll be able to see into the future because if you
[40:58] integrate yourself with this is a very trivial example but this is just one of many if you were to integrate yourself with some sort of an AI demon just to get really freaked out here but an artificial intelligence epigenetic demon
[41:12] that's running inside of your genes just like you could install an addiction to alcohol through a lot of drinking you could install uh uh some sort of AI software that that gave you the ability
[41:25] to count super fast to to delineate super fast okay and so now you have this idea this ability to delineate super fast and what what could
[41:38] you do with that one of the things you could do with that is freaking speak Wi-Fi like you could you could discern and listen to a bandwidth signal and more
[41:52] importantly you could interpret the bandwidth signal and give something back which means that it would be quite simple for us to imagine a point in our lives where we would be online and not
[42:04] need any kind of interface to do that that simply through our vibration could we put these things out and and I don't think there's any speculation here the only thing we're missing is that resolution that's it and and even with
[42:18] technology now with contact lenses with by focals we're able to see resolutions we couldn't see before we have polarizing lenses now you can see into the water and see a fish underneath that you couldn't see before and if you come
[42:32] back to your Aboriginal time imagine that that no water was ever seethrough that all it was was just a white moving glue it looked like glue and it moved super fast and it looked like glue and
[42:46] you could stick your hand in it and feel around it maybe you could grab a fish but it wasn't until the first time you actually grabbed a fish out of there that you started to notice I need to be able to see into this and I think this truly is much more
[43:00] in the origin of where we are and all of Greek mythology says James is right on this because it tells you about Hades it describes it this is the place of the Unseen it's not the place of evil it's the place of the Unseen this is all the things that exist in the world that you
[43:14] do not see or hear this is the richest place in the world why was Pluto the king of riches why was the Underworld the place of riches because all the riches are hidden in this world because we are still learning to stick
[43:29] our fish into the glue and pull a fish out and go holy [ __ ] I think I can see through this thing now I can smell things I can render this white glue and show currents and edes and it it allows
[43:43] me oh if we keep doing this 50,000 years from now we're going to be able to see a fish we're gonna be able to render what that fish looks like how big it is and for all inten of purposes we'll think it's real and at no point will it ever
[43:56] be false because no matter what if we stick our hand in exactly the right time and we grab that we're going to come out with a fish so that means everything is true every single thing that we saw must be true because it worked makes sense indeed well do you
[44:11] have a question Vance or the Clone that replaced you when you dropped out for a second well yeah I was wondering um as far as you were saying about um you know
[44:23] that babies are you know don't have a particular sex when they're born what about the X and Y chromosomes isn't it pretty well established that we have X and Y chromosomes that's what determines
[44:37] what yeah genitals develop yeah yeah in fact um so so at no point in time does that change we're born with this with these genetic markers but our pituitary
[44:49] hasn't uh written that code yet so it's like when you're born your eyes are still um they are still building themselves most of your brain is still building itself right yeah and and so
[45:04] the time it takes for you to build itself is actually the time where you're creating you're writing to your own log file and if you were to clone yourself after two years old you would have already had pre-site training for site
[45:16] itself so coming back to this question you're always going to have those chromosomes but we discover our puberty as we grow older we we we step into to
[45:27] who we are and H and how we're going to uh gender ourselves basically so we the the chromosomes are always there but until we we become aware of them until our software is able to plug into them I
[45:42] think we haven't actually found our identity yet in in that gender part of it and that's what that's what takes a while yeah certainly you don't get the certain sexual feelings until you're certain age you know the hormones start flowing right is that what you're
[45:56] referring to uh well definitely that but even uh um so I I I found the whole what's happened in our culture from the time I grew up in high school there was never an issue
[46:08] with uh gender dysphoria was uh or dysmorphia was never a thing that that you saw it wasn't really a concept it was something that I saw on TV that was kind of joked about but that was it that was about the extent of it and now we're
[46:23] looking at a world where that's a much more uh uh deep trench of thought and there's just a lot more things hanging around there I think that's showing you the resolution has gotten higher our
[46:36] resolution our ability to identify into something has gotten so uh thick that that we've seen it overflow through the gender and now we have all these different words and pronouns that we use it's really more that they're just
[46:51] showing you that the drum of of how we how we identify with ourselves has so much more resolution now that the old uh the old categories that we kept are are not doing a good job anymore so we're expanding on
[47:09] them makes sense makes sense so do you want to talk about the color blue you mentioned associating blue with Hades and we kind of started it in our last interview about the importance of blue
[47:23] and as we were talking blue is a color we had to invent or Discover right and it's very pror in your book yeah yeah we basically hallucinate blue the phobia which which holds most of the receptors
[47:36] that that that render color to you through the use of opsin and Rib opsins uh the amount of receptors that actually receive blue is a very very low low number uh too low to associate how much
[47:48] blue you actually most of us actually see uh when we look at the sky for example and so it's we enhance this color in some way and uh I think we're at the beginning of understanding that
[48:02] if we're enhancing blue we're actually enhancing everything we see and I think this is a hard thing for people to accept and to kind of come to grips with with what's happening so blue is just
[48:16] the start in my opinion um and and the reason why blue is is is something new is in in my opinion we don't really have like a direct answer on this but is probably because again we've we've
[48:29] gained a wider drum of Consciousness just like we're able to to to see ourselves as more than uh than a binary for example we we're going to see ourselves more than deeper than in 12
[48:44] colors so I think we're still seeing ourselves for who we are we just simply expanded our pallet more and and with that pallet expansion there just becomes a necessity to kind of create more more words for it so so right now blue just
[48:59] happens to be the the final frontier of our color spectrum but even magenta uh has the same process even as we're we're learning to look at additive colors versus subtractive colors or RGB versus
[49:13] CMYK we're learning to hallucinate different color sets all from using San magenta yellow and black so that right there is a kind of hallucination the mores that you see on a newspaper
[49:27] um I believe that we had to be taught to look at them as a black and white image because if you were to take a magnifying glass you just see black circles some black circles are bigger some black circles are smaller and that your brain
[49:41] is hallucinating the picture that's there it's giving you the stable diffusion of the dots it's giving you the latent space to where you can imagine what's there I think ultimately this is actually how our reality is is
[49:56] actually happening it's not actually what we see is what's there what we see is what we hallucinated out of the latent space and we decided this is the most accurate representation reality is about
[50:10] accuracy it's not about Precision those sound the same so we can use any other word you want but the goal is in reality is not to come up with the truth the goal is to come up with something that works and I can prove that to you
[50:25] because so many times really all that matters and once we have something that works we just go to bed we just we just move on the next problem and we we'll always do that because there's too many problems to solve it'll take it'll take light years I think until we come back
[50:39] to start to go well why don't we why don't we look at what's actually true versus what actually works so what's working is to have two genders that people associate into and puberty and

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
50:52] that puberty is held a little bit higher than normal so puberty is maybe 50 or 16 the social networks doing that if you were to leave people by their own devices in the woods I'm just guessing but I think PR would probably be more
[51:06] like 10 or 11 I just think that without the cultural uh uh Moorings there that that the pituitary Works more and that you're able to Stave it off least so
[51:20] with cloning all that's out the window because these gears have already un unwounded in you the these processes have already decided that your favorite color is green so now you're born and you [ __ ] hate green but something has
[51:36] been telling you that your favorite color is green now you could argue well you wouldn't have that James because it's built in and this is why I love this subject I I yeah it's profound but it also could be that underneath that layer underneath that haunting that your
[51:48] favorite color is green there's you are thriving and you freaking love peuse you think peuse is the greatest color that's ever been born it's the most under color ever and how do you come out with that and so you end up being a contrarian and people don't know why you're a
[52:03] contrarian and maybe the reason why you're contrarian is because you're epigenetically wrestling with your own hauntings that have come before so these things Define us right they don't break us they Define us I don't think that we'd exist if we didn't have these
[52:16] hauntings there's there's just there's no way we'd be too automaton anyway and I think we die then because we we'd be we'd be too predictable so this is about a profound here and understanding who who and what we are and how we actually function I
[52:30] think very well said yeah and in your book you talk about the importance of blue I think again this is a blue man he talks about or maybe it's you and Krishna wasn't the only blue Lord Rama Vishnu Khali and Shiva were also blue
[52:45] the Egyptian gods amoon and Ammon were blue ammon's name means the hidden one we're back at Hades our mythology tells us the Lord of Hades is blue again the link between the blue and insane and for the audience there are there were
[52:59] ancient cultures who had no color blue Homer Indian writings they call it green or wine color even today in your book there are aborigines who have no color blue it's green even if you show them
[53:13] blue they're like oh green green yes and thoughts I have on that it reminds me of the story of people with blue eyes James they say that once upon a time all people humans had brown eyes but there was some virus or something changed
[53:29] 10,000 years ago they're arguing whether it was Scandinavia or Egypt I always go for Egypt but blue is a scarring of some viral trauma that humanity went through
[53:41] 10,000 years ago dune's very popular right now what happens when you have the spice and you see God your eyes turn blue and lastly going to Elvis there was
[53:54] this weird Habit in sandwich in between you know occult theosophist and the 20s 30s for man Le Pall and the hippie new ages in the 60s there was this weird Group which Elvis was part of and Larry
[54:08] Geller I don't know if they were Proto new aers or or past past occultist but blue was really big for Elvis and his uh spiritual people who work spiritually when Elvis healed and he would heal I
[54:23] mean there's so many instan of of healing heart attacks head akes whatever he had to focus on the color blue he had to get it up and do the blue thing and wow there was a story when he was born a blue light fell on his house blue was a
[54:37] color that he used in most of his songs movies and the day he died there was blue everywhere he sang a song with blue he put on Blue pajamas which he I mean there's in my book there's this is blue everywhere and I'm not the first to
[54:52] notice people were just wondering that blue and Elvis's mystical side and and occultist in those days was really the color of God or mysticism so some of my thoughts they James yeah yeah and when
[55:06] you you think about if you asfixiate you turn blue and so you you become dead you be you enter into the world of 80s you you step in Rama was said to or Krishna
[55:19] was said to the reason why Krishna was blue is because the world is so dirty that it it it turned him blue and so uh it was the world's lies uh made his skin turn blue and so
[55:34] all the lies would be this the same analogy as as the world that's unseen and so in order for us to keep lies going we're we toxify them with this blue sort of hiddenness to them and as
[55:47] we get more advanced we have to look at Blue more and it freaks us out so really we're just looking at an archaic form of things that were stuffed under the rug 20,000 years ago and that now we've
[56:01] gotten Advanced enough to where we can see them like alcohol is a perfect example of that the bakus itself uh the alcoholism that you're seeing now is is the the animism has has become more
[56:15] retiz it's become hallucinated into the world and now we have the Super Bowl and this is what it looks like now so as we get better uh at looking at all at I think that's why there's so many frauds now like there's all these different
[56:29] fields we're seeing all this new fraud cases come out and people are explaining it as if I've never seen fraud this this rampant ever and it's like yeah I know because you've never seen the world this rampant ever before and so you're just
[56:43] looking at the world now for what it truly is and if we can show courage and if we can St looking at this if we can keep looking into this concept if we developed a love for the the blues how
[56:57] fitting is it that when we play the blues we close our eyes and we feel it and that why are you playing sad music and why is everyone happy because it's giving you this same clue right that the color of things that are unseen are
[57:11] going to be sad and painful at first and that you can find a way to romanticize that difficulty so this is why orus uses music to travel into the
[57:24] underworld to rescue his dead wife he uses music because this is the only medium that he would have to communicate with a place that's literally invisible to him so he calls forth what he wants
[57:39] this magic of the bident Hades is the place of the bident where Poseidon is the place of the Trident and that these three worlds were you could look at as your Ed your ego and your super ego and
[57:52] so really Hades itself is inside of you the shol is your ID I believe and so when we are aware of what our ID truly wants uh just to really quickly say your ID may want to I want to take and
[58:07] acquire this sex or this beer or this food or this gold or this du and that the ID could have this very debasing quotequote evil unseen uncomfortable motivation and that the first thing you
[58:22] would do is hide that from yourself so when we look about what Hades really is it's easier for us to see it in the outside world but when we're ready to see it in ourselves well now we're now we're cooking with gas because your
[58:36] cranial spinal fluid you could look at as the climbing down to the bottom of the marana's trench would be going all the way to the deepest parts of your cranial spinal fluid and that down there is the ruling of Hades this is all your
[58:51] sexual urges your old factory urges the Inner Essence of your ID would be all these things that you've gone to so much effort to hide yourself from that's why when babies are born we turn off this
[59:05] old factory gland inside of our mouth we shut it off and I think ultimately that's why this book describes smell and Hades is being really synonymous with the same things because all the truths that you know are expressed in your
[59:18] chemo signals you you you cannot lie through evaporation your pores are never going to lie about your intentions so no matter what you say your smell that you emanate from your reef is going to be
[59:33] detected by everyone in the room because Hades is here it's just that all of us are in unison agreeing to ignore each other's deeper smell because frankly it's the only way we can be comfortable around each other well said indeed well
[59:46] I'd like to do a little housekeeping as they say and announce more or less formally because James will be joining us and I hope to see you there to please
[59:59] join us at the Astron nois conference uh tickets are on sale August 9 and 10 at the theosophical society it was amazing last year and this year the theme will
[01:00:12] be sophian simulated realities more speakers more workshops more social events this is the pre preeminent Gnostic conference so check it out yes I
[01:00:25] am scrolling down for those of you who are watching on on video 20% off until the end uh until May 1 I got to fix that but yes so you have about another month
[01:00:38] to get your um discount tickets and it's going to be truly amazing I mean we love talking here on the internet and everything but I'm sure James agrees there's nothing like oneon-one real conversation I mean you realize you are
[01:00:53] living kind of in a false world but when you just get to hang out underneath a tree or in a hallway and exchange coffee and really important information that's when the magic happens so and that's why
[01:01:06] one of the reasons I do these things other than to try to share the best possible information out there theosophic is because yeah human connections is where we will reach to
[01:01:18] color blue and unveil Hades so James will be presenting um still working on the schedule and some of the guests more guests like uh Ola woy and Ryme are trying to get their visas to fly from
[01:01:32] Japan and Scandinavia but right now we got Mitch Horowitz yeah Ryme Richard smoley Christopher NOS Jason rezza geani Steven Snider James True David block and
[01:01:44] more to come and again it'll be uh two days of presentations highlevel uh presentations Q&amp;A panel social events afterwards are blast uh gift and swag so
[01:01:59] here's just some examples and I hope to see you there there's James on one of the panels and then there's James here the placenta Egypt uh Oracle mythology
[01:02:10] incredible presentation so that is the uh housekeeping for today and yeah please support aam Biden anyway you can definitely support James uh let's see this is his website
[01:02:26] jr.com well I still have this well the screen share still works so James is always putting uh Great Stuff how to get his book how to get his book by avoiding evil Amazon and get a signed copy blog
[01:02:40] posts uh all the fun stuff is there on his website and all of his books and resources and everything so definitely help out James as we as the real Great reset happens and the end of the world
[01:02:54] gets closer and it's going to be a revolution of the mind so that's the housekeeping Vance any questions from you no out of questions really um well
[01:03:06] no I do have one um James are you a Consciousness is an epiphenomenon of the brain guy or are you um Consciousness contains physical reality guy or
[01:03:19] something other than those two things um I it seems like a a critical brain I'm I'm a critical brain theorist I think so Consciousness it it comes from the
[01:03:32] xenophobic nature of all things conglomerated inside your body so I I even right now when we Define what what is considered brain dead it's it's really sketchy like we we even call it brain dead because doctors were like
[01:03:48] well okay he's not really dead he's just brain dead what does that mean it means we can take his organs like so he's not no right right he's not dead but legally we can take his organs and that that's that's we call that a thing and so I
[01:04:02] think we're still in a very young age about when we understand what what it actually is I don't think it exists in the brain I think that the brain is probably the one of the one of the least important organs inside your body when
[01:04:16] it comes to Consciousness my take personally is that your liquid your cranial spinal fluid is a liquid consciousness but it's came from a part where we did we didn't understand that technology we still don't understand
[01:04:30] that in a world where water is so vitally important to me one of the biggest clues that there's something going on here is simply because every hour we're having to produce a a new shock glass full of
[01:04:45] cranial spinal fluid and that that's a lot to demand that the body have no matter what no matter where you go you're going to have to make this liquid and and when you when you consider that the the pineal is suspended in that
[01:04:59] liquid it it seems to me that Consciousness itself would be the the horns and the liquid filled horns of your the chambers of your brain which are shaped like horns uh are full of cranial spinal fluid and that that
[01:05:13] liquid uh looks like an upside down sword that's kind of shoved into your spine and it goes all the way down to your base and that that liquid probably is who we are that's probably the essence of who we are that we're always
[01:05:28] kept in that state which is why we can't really die and come back there's something to me is a big clue about about our lives yeah you can bring someone back after a certain resuscitation but for the most part how
[01:05:41] we Define living is is as a temporal line that it goes from here to there and I think that feels more liquid to me almost as if how long can you maintain the liquid Essence to pull your IP
[01:05:54] address to allow the signal to be processed in this place so to me it's outside but it's all things at once because it's such a Zeus equation the the ion channels is probably closer to
[01:06:07] who we are that electrical nuanced field that surrounds us all that's the Gestalt that's what's called critical brain Theory most of your thinking is not really done inside the neuron it's more when the criticality of all these
[01:06:22] explosions occur that above those explosions we end up with this identity and so Consciousness is is that it's the equation of all those meta identities so it's never in the world but it's so it's
[01:06:35] also never able to have a decaron snippet to say this is the point it's it's all points conglomerated that's interesting here's an interesting point because it's in your book from Stony Curtis maybe
[01:06:50] Hydrophobia rabus is fear of water rabies victims see water and are terrified by the Light Of Consciousness wow water is a carrier perhaps good point because you do talk about radi in your book yeah Sony that's a fabulous
[01:07:03] Point yeah I've never really put those two together but that that really does make a lot of sense in fact all all identity is is hydrophobic every single thing that you consider precious is
[01:07:15] simply held by a barrier of Hydrophobia there's your all membranes are basically uh lipids right and the lipids have a hatred for uh the the touching of water and that
[01:07:29] they form an alliance with with each other says hey you hate water I hate water too I don't want water to touch my feet the other lipid's like I don't want water to touch my feet I'm like hey why don't we put our feet together and they do and that that's the entire equation that that that forms your entire
[01:07:43] perimeter of everything so it seems to me that most of us are more like V diagrams we are a separate space of water that's held together by a lipid fear of nonwater
[01:07:56] our fear of water is our fear of losing identity because the moment that we touch we Splash into the sh the moment that our CSF was to touch other water we would we would lose our identity completely right the same way that if
[01:08:09] you were to pour your cup of coffee into a thermos that already had soapy dishw water in it your your identity is gone that's not going to be who you are anymore very well said do would you add something else
[01:08:24] B um yeah I was just going to say uh that you know water is said by many to um hold memory which is not intuitive if you think of as a simple molecule um in
[01:08:37] fact um uh homeopathic medicine depends on that because you take some sort of substance and you keep diluting it until there's no trace of the substance left but the water that remains is set to
[01:08:52] hold the memory of the molecules that you were originally you know putting in the water beautiful yeah you it's been christened by that presence it's uh yeah same same thing as what we're talking about about the Clones the uh
[01:09:07] epigenetics you know that fear of the garden hose is not really there it's not really tangibly there and that's why it's so hard to uh to think about how
[01:09:19] how who who who and what we are like what what exactly defines Who We Are how different are you from your clone model if it wasn't
[01:09:31] on if if you could turn it on autopilot your identity ends up seeming to be more about how you react to an event that seems to be the essence of who we are one of the things that my
[01:09:46] book discusses is the idea of an epigenetic contract in that when you prick your finger every cell that's that's that's going through an RNA transcript the
[01:09:59] moment that you prick your finger could maybe have a notion that that their finger was just pricked that their their border was just attacked and that uh innocent red blood
[01:10:12] shells cells were were removed and Shed from our sacred land and that it occurred at this time and that in the middle of that RNA transcript that cell would be writing that trauma into the cell copy it wouldn't it and keep in
[01:10:28] mind how cell copying Works how does RNA transcription work it's trying to make a perfect copy and it doesn't what happens it makes a mistake quotequote I'm using mistake here very Loosely air quote
[01:10:40] mistake here it's makes a mistake and that this is what we call Evolution we call this adaptation that we learn to make mistakes in our genetic copies and some of those mistakes we end up re-evaluating going let's keep this
[01:10:54] this this might work and that even the things now that we call successes are simply things that we're keeping to work that we haven't necessarily sent to our cerebellum yet we haven't necessarily said this is definitely gold it just seems like for the last 7,000 years this
[01:11:08] has been the perfect way to respond so it takes this long before we actually start to hardcode things into our cerebell to where we can't even have have control over it so when you think about who you are your your presence in
[01:11:23] this life really has nothing to do with your epigenetic disposition it more has to do with what you do under your epigenetic disposition because how you respond is going to write or alter your
[01:11:38] code and this I think this is ultimately at the heart of what makes a man great if every time that your RNA is transcribing itself if you are feeling
[01:11:51] like a God if you are feeling powerful if you you are feeling loving and compassionate if you were feeling as if you are a vital part of all things then everything that's written into the transcripts of all those millions of
[01:12:06] cells that are copying and L less they copying as you get older as used to but because now the now it's just they're not rewriting themselves as much as they're just like regrowing themselves so you you get less of a chance to hack
[01:12:19] your system as you get older we say but you always have the chance to hack your system but you don't actually get to say I'm going to no longer be a yellow car I'm going to be a red car instead you get to say at first I didn't like the yellow car but now I'm a dude that
[01:12:34] really loves yellow cars and that by doing that that's what actually makes you a better person that your epigenetics are are making mistakes in they copying but they're mistaking in a
[01:12:47] good way they're mistaking in a groovy way to where no man it just works it just works it just works and the more we do that I think that's really what makes us awesome and What Makes Us awful what
[01:13:00] makes us uh deeply genetically haunted is when we're constantly feeling victimized when we're constantly feeling like this this happened but I didn't deserve it those are the things that seem to be the RNA wres that
[01:13:14] get like the scratches on the record as we're trying to copy because we're like fine I will copy this event this event was the greatest thing that ever happened to me and that as you're saying that as you're copying you're writing bad data you're making a bad copy
[01:13:30] because the intent that you have behind the notes this is how Jazz works this is how all music works what is your intent behind the note because sure you hit those notes right but look at the reaction in the audience between when you played it here versus when you
[01:13:43] played it here what is that reaction and that reaction is what was your Vibe what was your Alchemy of the space that you have right now so it seems like most of our identity isn't really
[01:13:56] changing our epigenetics it it's it's it's creating a groovy graceful copying transition between those two things and that gives us more grace or less Grace overall which makes us more successful
[01:14:10] and less successful overall it seems like the question I have um couple to going to your book is uh when uh when I first heard of your book James Black ey
[01:14:24] club and you've seen on the internet people with pictures of celebrities and Royals and the pope and they're all walking with their black eye and everybody's like still trying to crack is this again one of those uh abasan rituals that you've talked about you
[01:14:39] really one those uh you know those rituals those shaming rituals punishing rituals or or what is it is that why you call the book blackeyed club yeah in fact uh um it's actually why I started
[01:14:51] to write the book is I started to compassionate what would if you were an elite why would you why would you have a black eye one day and it made no sense in my opinion it made no sense that there's an
[01:15:05] underground Fight Club I don't think the pope has those kind of reflex controls and uh and I don't I don't think most of us do I I don't think that's a skill that that would make you better in the world to learn how to uh
[01:15:19] just take a punch to the face but there's a lot of procedures that happen that give you a black eye and one of those procedures involves any kind of a uh injection to uh certain parts of the eye and so I just started

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:15:33] naturally researching well what would you what would an elite do to their eye that no one else can do and that's what led me to the eye of raah work that I that I did this uh what I consider groundbreaking work I I know that sounds self- serving but it's just
[01:15:48] it's just a different way of looking in Consciousness and uh it's it was just discovered I just kept reading what the science said and that so much of of what we interpret in our world is throttled through dopamine and melanin and that uh
[01:16:02] by watching these chemicals uh play their game um we're able to see more or less of reality and of course everything that we're discussing with Hades is just just fits right in like it's just like so
[01:16:14] perfectly explains it so back to the black eye Club you if you could take a serum that would allow you to see smell you would know when someone's
[01:16:28] lying if they're in the room with you you would see their Aura their chemo signal their furones that would come out of their skin every time they breathe their pores would emanate these little sea creatures that would tell you whether or
[01:16:43] not they are being deceptive and I thought that would be something that people would want I could see people doing that and that they've learned to see the demons in the world because they've learned to unlock their old factory system and that this injection
[01:16:57] to the eye did that because it was turning you into an albino it was giving you albinism of the eye and it was doing that by uh finding a way to convince your melanocytes to
[01:17:12] stop secreting melanin which is what our eyes use to absorb harmful information like this woman doesn't actually uh think I'm a handsome man she's going to drug me and and take my kidney tonight
[01:17:25] and that part of you is like yeah but I really want to have a good time she seems this will be great and the other part of you is like no we have to run and who are you who you are gets to decide how much data do I want in the world because some of us would be like I
[01:17:39] don't care I really want a night where someone tells me they love me and you don't know what's G to what it's going to require to get someone to that point so I'm saying that shutting off the old factory believe it or not is not like a horrible decision I don't
[01:17:54] think we could have created civilization without one which is why this is such a profound thing I think that's happening it's such a necessity but it's also holding us back so much so the celebrity
[01:18:05] has eliminated this ability uh to to be lied to because they've this injection that they've gotten now they see the world in its truthful uh true ways it's
[01:18:17] turned them into an albino and so the uh uh that's the premise of the book but I felt that all the other stuff just so was so much more deeper than just celebrities I just think the celebrities are just kind of boring in themselves so
[01:18:33] there wasn't nearly as when I first started to write the book there wasn't nearly as many celebrities underground fight clubs as as I thought were going to be in the book but but I I really think that the story is just so much
[01:18:47] more profound than that because it really does unwrap this nature of reality and where we're going and by the way this is actually a prequel to Quantum Rapture that some of you have read and that you don't need to read that but if you have read that you
[01:19:01] already know who one of the character is is and that makes it a really just totally different trip because you know the whole time that this isn't even human that this person's talking to so it's just like an extra little layer of things and then I think the
[01:19:16] sequel again it the Sci-Fi gives you gives me the opportunity just to share these ideas of Science and I I believe that the sequel when we start to under understand what the Orca sees why why
[01:19:28] the Orca uh when it killed its trainer in the UK a few years ago why why did it scalp her why did it swim around the tank with her scalp in its mouth what is
[01:19:41] the is that a psychotic Orca or is it something else I I think it's something else I think that as we approach uh a
[01:19:52] god their tenor for vibration would simply just be so much bigger than ours and so what we consider to be uh loud
[01:20:05] would be a whisper to them and vice versa and so the the feelings and the emotions that we consider evil really really are broken down to just less
[01:20:17] volume and so when we watch say orcas and what they do in the water we assume that they're a brutal evil creature but actually they're just so consciously lit
[01:20:30] they have such a deeper aperture than you and I do that that all the emotions are are spiked it's kind of like an amplification if you're editing video or audio and you want to bump the audio up you're going to turn the audio gain up
[01:20:44] for that entire signal and so if you're not used to that audio gain you're going to think everyone just screams all the time but actually they don't it's just that your Fidelity is so much weaker than theirs is and I think ultimately this is what Hades is teaching us is teaching us to
[01:20:59] have a more resilient uh aperture ability to see things more this is why we can see blue when we couldn't see it before this is why we can play with microwaves when we didn't even know they existed before this is why I think ultimately we'll be
[01:21:13] speaking WiFi um as we advance more because we're just gaining higher resolution higher F Fidelity the entire time which is broadening understanding which is something we actually didn't want
[01:21:26] because our understanding is showing you everything yeah let me quote from your book for those think about the black eye club and smell but you write supporting your science there's a
[01:21:40] college in New York that collected the armpit sweat from 20 skydivers on their first jump they put the sweat in a nebul nebulizer and expose it to a volunteer in a brain scan
[01:21:55] the volunteers amig amigdala and hypothalamus activated the same way as the skydivers terrified of jumping Their Fear was fully transmitted through the
[01:22:08] sweat's chemo signature so that right there tells you yeah yeah absolutely true I'm so glad you brought that up I would thought of it that's yeah absolutely true the the all the information is there all all the terror that that skydiver went through these
[01:22:23] are the people that are afraid of doing it uh was transmitted through that chemo signal in a vial sent thousands of miles away to a complete stranger and I think their computer you could play you could spray the [ __ ] in a train station full
[01:22:36] of people right and get them to do what you want them to do yes Bo in fact we we do this all the time yeah most of the flavorings that we use in our food most of the things that that we smell we're actually smelling them because they're
[01:22:49] cubing off those same signals and as we Advanced what we consider to be food will change because the resolution of our chemo signat signatures change so we're able to appreciate tertiary flavors for
[01:23:03] example you know no different than a child who's really like look macaroni and cheese tastes yellow Pizza tastes red right apples taste green I don't want a lot of apples I want a lot of red and I want a lot of yellow and that that
[01:23:17] that's a primary way of looking of food and that as you grow their pallet would grow and that that's what's happening to us too right now fascinating ah the human mind and some might get your book which of course I highly recommend they might be open he said wait a second this is not happening
[01:23:34] in Argentina these cats have been talking about Hitler and Argentina and clones it happens in Tanzania maybe you can explain to the audience and on a little side note I live as a three-year-old I lived in da Salam
[01:23:47] Tanzania I don't remember much I was three uh but my parents said I did pick up Swahili and I was the their translator I remember my nanny and the beach and stuff like that but that's all I remember and obviously once we move I
[01:24:02] think we moved to Peru I I forgot my Swahili but wow interesting why why why East Africa that's amazing uh so Tanzania is the heart of albanism
[01:24:15] it's uh one in 200 I think uh uh are born in with uh some some form of albanism and um it's brutal it's brutal because you're you know people might might have
[01:24:32] a romantic idea of what it's like to be worshiped but I I don't think you get how much that can suck and and the AL the albino in Tanzania is living that there he's constantly said that that
[01:24:44] you're my luck charm and he's also like we're going to collect your hand I'm going to if I sell your hand on eBay I can make 50 Grand it's your right hand yeah and I'll sell your left hand I'll make 30 grand it's it's fine I'll do
[01:24:58] that too and so you're you're brought up thinking that you're special but then you realize what special really means the chosen one yeah exactly yeah exactly for what yeah and and if you if you look
[01:25:12] so so there's all kinds of of brilliant wonderful debate happening anthro anthropologically right now about where is the origin of man and stuff I I I I don't think this this even messes with that but I do think that there's been
[01:25:26] this push to insist that Africa has not been the cradle of civilization and I I think that's kind of naive to say that I think that it's hard to dismiss what Africa has
[01:25:37] done uh to Modern Man and that for whatever reason for and I have a reason I have a reason I think this is why but for for there's a certain reason why Africa has been a
[01:25:52] cradle that has uh ejected uh super Advanced life forms very rapidly very quickly over a very short amount of time and with stunning
[01:26:06] success that's repeated enough to a point to where I believe it's hard to argue that this is just evolutionary chance and that the uh all all branches
[01:26:19] of of of what we call homo sapien sapien now are extinct they did horribly but for some reason ours made it and ours didn't just make it ours made it and then instantly evolved like
[01:26:34] 5,000 years later and then instantly evolved like 20,000 years later and it it did so in such a perfect way it looks to me like an AI had something to do with it it just looks that way it looks
[01:26:48] to me like an epigenetic unwinding could occur that would cause the Sapien to sapate that's why it's called homo sapien sapien that for whatever reason this tumor of awareness decided to grow
[01:27:01] another tumor of awareness and so we ended up with an ID that grew an ego first which made it prolific as [ __ ] and then it said okay now we want the super ego and that when you create those things you end up with a super monster
[01:27:15] that's just more powerful than a [ __ ] elephant more powerful than a lion this is a big [ __ ] deal and so when you look at Africa uh it becomes very difficult for me not to notice that this
[01:27:28] truly is this this birthplace for these things and that when I picture the story of bluman a guy that ultimately lost his his wife and that he doesn't want to let go
[01:27:42] and so he follows the path he he goes into hell and he says I don't want to let you go and he clones her and he doesn't tell her family and so he's he's now an outlaw if he wants to be with his wife he's now
[01:27:57] an outlaw so he has to say goodbye to his career and the first thing he does is he goes to South Africa because he's looking for a surrogate because he scraped the uterus of his dead wife and
[01:28:09] she died he he knew Not only was she special to him but as a hermaphrodite this is a a Royal bloodline seed that blo very confused by he doesn't understand why he just did this so he runs away and he goes to South Africa
[01:28:24] AFC because he's like I got to I got to find someone to gate these guys I want my wife back and so he clones his wife and he has this he raises his wife and it's not his wife it's a haunted
[01:28:38] victim and he's the perpetrator and he's watching the perpetrator he's watching himself as the perpetrator raising his own wife on a clone Farm in Africa it's the most
[01:28:50] profound love story I swear it will blow you away because it really does show you how technology does not restore the preciousness of life it does not invigorate these things it's quite the
[01:29:03] opposite and that when you see why this story is I think it really will make sense why Lera Lita's daughter who in Quantum Rapture is the way she is but more importantly it's going to really open up to why all this stuff is
[01:29:18] happening why we're here and um it's a longer story it involves you understanding your grandparents you're it involves you looking back to 50,000 years ago and realize that you were just as vital then as you are
[01:29:33] now you're just on a different different part of that stock is all yeah I love uh this quote while we're on the topic of Tanzania and you write in Swahili the root word for
[01:29:47] insane means to be sincere or transparent to be crazy or wazimu is to carry no lies that is a quite a Wasim comment there so glad you brought that
[01:30:00] up yeah the the the a white man or a person not from Africa are both called man who spins in
[01:30:13] circles and uh it's rotisserie it's just it and if you think about it if you have no melanin if your skin isn't dark the Sun is so bright that the only relief you can find is to
[01:30:26] slowly turn yourself slowly so that you're always part of you in the shade and that that this is the wazimu this is zeru zeru uh the albino is someone who lacks the ability to hide and so they're
[01:30:42] turned into a ghost and so in Africa for you to have lies means that you have value and this just blows me away this is so beautiful because the moment that you start to covet something in Africa is the moment that you recognize that
[01:30:57] it's valuable to you and the only way that you can have value to something is to hide it is to covet it this the concept of potlatch by the way where you you keep your pot latch covered all year until one day on Potlatch day you you
[01:31:11] open your pot latch and say come look at my pot latch and people are like oh my God it's a great pot latch and then wh time's up and then you cover it again that's what keeps it sacred and in Africa this this idea of transparent y was something you would never trust
[01:31:25] someone that's transparent because this person has nothing to lose there's nothing in the game for them and I think that when you look at the modern world uh we have this notion of you're
[01:31:37] innocent until proven guilty and that sounds really beautiful but ultimately when you when you look at that you're you really are living in a world where people do not hold themselves accountable that we're living in a world
[01:31:52] where as long as as a majority of my other peers cannot hold me accountable I am completely innocent and that this would be this this uh a better understanding of what our world world
[01:32:05] really is and I think that because Africa lacks the Nuance of the fashion that we just lay on top of all the disgusting ways that we love but then hate then love then hate the same thing there's just a lot more honest about it
[01:32:19] and so I I think they're they're giving you a better insight into what it's like to actually uh be whole and to be stable is to be still in the sun and the only way you could remain still in the sun is to
[01:32:31] create your own shade right and to create your own shade is the antithesis of what the American idea would tell you to do which is that we want people to be absolutely transparent you
[01:32:43] know very true and I love that Nuance well makes sense well we are probably at the end I don't see any super chats but uh please support when you can I said where to go get your book James
[01:32:57] uh what when is the sequel coming out I don't know I actually started to write the sequel first and then uh so a lot more of that might be might be closer than I think but writing a book is such
[01:33:09] a beautiful and difficult Journey so I just have to open it back up and get there so I'm hoping to see how many will buy this this version and that's always the the ultimate uh teller for when the

[ARTICLE STYLE / FRAMEWORK]:
Toulmin Model writing framework: firstly establish a claim, then support it with evidence (grounds), and finally build a logical and persuasive case through warrants, which connect the evidence to the claim.

[ARTICLE SHOULD BE ABOUT]:
- **Subject**: Discussion on cloning, epigenetics, and ethical implications.
- **Participants**: Miguel Connor, James True, and a person referred to as "Vance" or "V".
- **Important Points**:
  - **Cloning Technology and its Application**:
    - Cloning technology is discussed, indicating it's feasible and relatively accessible, possibly utilized since the 1940s.
    - There's mention of cloning in the context of horses, particularly in polo, where a famous player allegedly used cloned horses in a tournament.
  - **Epigenetics and Cloning**:
    - The conversation delves into epigenetics and how cloning bypasses the natural innocence and developmental stages of an organism by replicating them at a later stage.
    - Clones are suggested to lack the innocence of naturally born organisms, with their genetic codes already imprinted with past experiences and traits.
    - Discussion highlights the ethical concerns regarding the loss of innocence and the psychological implications of cloning.
  - **Psychological and Societal Implications**:
    - Cloning is linked to psychological conflicts, suggesting that having two identical identities sharing the same genetic code could lead to a "psychological stalemate" and inevitable conflict.
    - The conversation also touches upon broader societal issues, including human trafficking and clandestine activities associated with cloning.
- **Cultural References**:
  - References are made to works of fiction and movies like "The Boys from Brazil" and "Infinity Pool," discussing ethical dilemmas and abuses related to cloning.
- **Personal Opinions**:
  - James True expresses the view that understanding oneself involves tapping into ancestral experiences and suggests that cloning could help in standardizing this process, albeit acknowledging the ethical dilemmas.
- **Historical References**:
  - Historical contexts, such as the eugenics movement and Nazi experimentation, are referenced in the discussion on cloning.
- **Scientific Insights**:
  - Scientific explanations, particularly regarding epigenetics and cloning processes, are provided, emphasizing the complexity and ethical considerations involved.
- **Moral and Ethical Considerations**:
  - Ethical considerations regarding the loss of innocence in clones, the potential psychological conflicts, and the broader societal impacts are extensively discussed.
- **Cultural and Societal Critique**:
  - Critique of societal norms and practices, including dog breeding and societal standards of beauty, are implied within the discussion on cloning and its implications.

- **Identity and Originality**: The discussion delves into the significance of identity and originality, emphasizing that one's unique identifier is more valuable than external achievements. The speaker suggests that having a unique identity is crucial for personal fulfillment.
  
- **Cloning and Identity**: Clones in the context of the discussion start with identical information and identities but face challenges regarding their individuality. The transcript explores how clones may share the same name to cope with their shared identity until they find their own distinct selves.

- **Hermaphroditic Themes**: There's mention of hermaphroditic themes, tying them to spiritual and biological concepts. The conversation touches on the concept of selfing, where hermaphrodites can self-reproduce, and relates it to religious narratives like the story of Mary.

- **Mythological and Scientific Integration**: The discussion integrates mythological concepts like Hades with scientific ideas about human evolution and perception. The speaker suggests that our perception of reality is a construct influenced by evolutionary processes and cultural conditioning.

- **Expanded Perception**: The dialogue proposes that human perception, including our understanding of colors like blue, is expanding as our consciousness evolves. It suggests that our perception of reality is not fixed but subject to change based on cultural and biological factors.

- **Philosophical Reflections**: The conversation touches on philosophical themes such as the nature of reality, the purpose of life, and the role of fear in human evolution. It suggests that our understanding of these concepts evolves over time as we gain more knowledge and insight.

- **Puberty and Social Networks**: Puberty is discussed as occurring earlier due to social networks, possibly around the age of 10 or 11 if cultural influences were absent. This suggests that societal factors may influence the timing of puberty.

- **Cloning and Identity**: Cloning raises questions about pre-determined traits and identity. The discussion delves into the concept that individuals may have predisposed characteristics, like favorite colors, even if they don't align with personal preferences.

- **Blue Symbolism**: The color blue is explored across various cultures and mythologies, symbolizing mysticism and divine connections. Examples include Krishna, Egyptian gods, and Elvis Presley's association with blue.

- **Association of Blue with Mysticism**: Blue is linked to mystical experiences, such as turning blue when asphyxiated or when experiencing spiritual transcendence, as depicted in literature and mythology.

- **Exploration of Consciousness and Brain Function**: The discussion shifts to consciousness, suggesting it may not reside solely in the brain but could involve other bodily systems, such as cranial spinal fluid, which is proposed as a carrier of consciousness.

- **Epigenetics and Identity Formation**: Epigenetics is highlighted as a factor in identity formation, suggesting that experiences and responses to them can influence genetic expression and, consequently, one's sense of self.

- **Hydrophobia and Identity**: Hydrophobia is metaphorically linked to identity, with membranes serving as barriers to water, symbolizing the fear of losing identity. This ties into the idea of cellular memory and the transmission of traits through water.

- **Epigenetic Contract**: The concept of an epigenetic contract is introduced, wherein experiences are encoded into cellular memory during RNA transcription, shaping future responses and behaviors.

- **Groovy Genetic Expression**: The idea that positive, empowering experiences lead to more graceful genetic expression is posited, contrasting with negative experiences that may result in less successful genetic outcomes.

- **Black Eye Club**: The title of the book, "Black Eyed Club," is explained as a reflection of the author's curiosity about why elites often have black eyes in photos, leading to investigations into potential medical procedures or rituals associated with this phenomenon.
