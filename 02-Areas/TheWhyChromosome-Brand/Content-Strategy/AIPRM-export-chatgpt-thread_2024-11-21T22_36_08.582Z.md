[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] this is a tape recordings being made February 3rd 1969 in the home of Frank Herbert in Fairfax California Frank and his wife Bev are sitting around myself
[00:14] dr. Willis II McNelly of Cal State mr. fireman in Thornton California sitting around talking about science fiction and Frank Herbert as we all know is the author of dune and many other science
[00:28] fiction novels Frank I wonder if you'd tell us a little bit about the origins of dune you started a little bit earlier and you said you can trace the germinal
[00:35] idea oh yes the idea came from a an article I was going to do an article which I never did about the control of
[00:51] sand dunes what made people don't realize is that the United States has pioneered in this how to control the flow of sand dunes and it started up your Florence Oregon there is a pilot
[01:06] project up there of the u.s. Forest Service which has been so successful that it has been visited and copied by
[01:16] experts related departments from Chile Israel India Pakistan Great Britain several other countries well I know I drove along the Oregon coast this summer
[01:35] and you had mentioned this a year ago that had begun with this what was happening along Oregon and I remember stopping at one fork there right south of the Columbia River it said yeah Oregon State Park now that's a story well Florida's considerably thought with
[01:50] that stuff again yeah it's about centrally located on the Oregon coast and it was an area where sand dunes blew across highway 1 US Highway 1 frequently blocking the highway and the Forest Service put in a
[02:03] test station down there to determine how they could control the flow of the sentence and I got fascinated by sand dunes because I'm always fascinated by the idea of something that is either seen in
[02:17] miniature and then can be expanded to these macrocosm teeth or which but for the difference in time in the flow rate
[02:28] in the entropy rate is similar to other features which we wouldn't think we're similar like all of the girl was this by the way whole this was in 53 this was
[02:42] considered 115 years ago yeah a long time ago sand dunes are like waves in a large body of water they just are slower
[02:53] and the people treating them as fluid learn to control them fluid mechanics another leg switch fluid mechanics with sand hmm and the whole idea fascinated me so I started researching steinem
[03:10] dunes and of course from sand dunes you it's a logical idea to go into a desert and the way I accumulate data is I start building file folders and before long I
[03:24] saw that I had far too much for an article and far too much for a story for a short story so I didn't know really what I had but I had enormous amount of data and evidence showing off at all
[03:39] angles to gather more and I was following them I can't read the dictionary you know I can't go look up a word everything else on the opposite page but then as I started accumulating
[03:53] these final folders which I'll show you later and as a result I finally saw that I had something enormously interesting going for me about the ecology of deserts and
[04:07] it was for a science fiction writer anyway it was an easy step from that to think what if I had an entire planet that was a desert and during my studies
[04:20] and deserts of course and previous studies of religions we all know that many religions began in a desert atmosphere so I decided to put the two together because I don't think that
[04:35] anyone's story should have any one thread I build on a layer technique and of course putting in religion religious ideas with ecological ideas you can play
[04:48] one against the other now this is you see I'm talking about the surface now that's right I'm not talking about the way things are layered in the novel itself that's right yeah and the way
[05:02] character has developed for various reasons in the storage this is just the germ of the idea but that's where it begins again 15 years ago then well what
[05:14] made you or at what point did you go from the sand dunes of Oregon and the ecological background there to the decision to utilize let's say the
[05:26] Arabian mystique as a as another counter notion or contrapuntal notion working within the novel well of course I'm studying Sandoz you immediately get into
[05:39] not just the Arabian mystique but the Navajo mistake and mistake of the Kalahari primitives and all of re
[05:52] primitives the Kalahari Desert the black book available of the Kalahari and how they utilize every drop of water and they you
[06:07] can't just stop with the people who are living in this kind of environment you have to go on to how the environment works on the people and how they work on their environment just I mean you could look at this thing on the Oregon cook
[06:22] specifically if you wanted to and say yes the sand was covering the highway and that's bad who say we play certain grasses and that stops the sand for moving in that school and that's the end of it yeah that's the end of it but if you start going into the mechanics of
[06:36] how the United States Forest Service set up this project and all of the internal politics undoubtedly that were involved I only know part of them but I know enough to know they were quite a few more then you would probably have a
[06:51] story there the main speak type type of story yeah but I got off on a different kick because of the science fiction angle and the emphasis on ecology it's been my
[07:03] belief for a long time that a man inflicts himself on his environment that is Western man I think we can see that just looking around us the simple thing
[07:17] of beer used to be packed in bottles which eventually disintegrated then it was packed in cans and that took at a 50-year half-life and now it's packed in aluminum cans and that you know lives forever and we're grabbing the karela
[07:31] garden yeah well alright but we're gradually corrupting our environment as a result of that kind of plastic is the favorite we do you know Bevin are up on the Washington coast last year and an
[07:43] area of unspoiled literally he very primitive area funded for the macaws tribes living Tony and even there down among the driftwood logs on that
[07:56] primitive beach that almost unspoiled H you frequent very much to people they come on these blue orange green white
[08:06] plastic containers Purex my result they and their virtually indestructible there they are they float well man is then as you view him a creature who
[08:21] ecologically is a destructive force and divisive force well we tend to think in western I talk about Western yeah you
[08:31] realize that we tend to think that we can overcome nature by a mathematical means we accumulate enough data and and
[08:44] then sander parameters of that data and yes of do we subdue nature this is a one pointed vision of man because if you really start looking at at man Western
[08:58] man you'll see that you can cut him right down the middle and he's blind on that backside you see this is a point that you made earlier been talking about the death of the planetary colleges in
[09:13] dune being a very touching spot I think you said it very moving Oh significant point a long story flowing around how the college ha ha I was very important that the
[09:27] planets kill the acknowledges even though the planet what I mean even though the ecologist was technically able to subdue anything within that well there he lay dying understanding I would
[09:40] happen exactly it was more than someone else died on desert were head completely understanding how do you made it more horrible he knew what was happy that woman understood it and was technically capable of controlling it he knew it and
[09:52] God yes this of course was done deliberately for that purpose me to turn is a turning point in the whole book but
[10:01] to pivot you might say and the very fact that Keynes who is the Western man in my
[10:16] original construction that was going to seize all of these things happening to him as mechanical things doesn't detract from the fact that he is still a part of
[10:31] his system because it is observing him he's lived out of rhythm with it and he got on the in the trough of a wave and it tumbled on him and we are polluting our atmosphere recruiting our rivers or
[10:45] polluting our beaches because we don't understand the principles of ecology among other things well ecology is somebody said and I use this I don't recall I'd like to tribute this but I don't recall where I
[10:58] encountered it I did read over 200 books in the background novels of somebody said that ecology is the science of understanding
[11:12] consequences remember that lovely extension I remember that and of course where each of us individually is the product of everything that has happened
[11:25] here and this happened to me and hit me and so I used it because as far as I was concerned one of the purposes of this
[11:35] story was to delineate consequences of inflicting yourself upon a planet upon your environment so you have a number of forces then that are inflicting themselves upon the planet you have the
[11:50] Freeman horses you have the forces of the house of treaties to brown the traitors Atreides parentheses I'd love to examine with you the possible implications of the house of Atreus in
[12:04] the Greek legend there in parentheses and you have the off-planet forces of the spacers guild and the entire Imperium also as being forces in flicking themselves on this planet hmm
[12:19] the name of the game is cholera is it you know if it is today we play the game today with counters called money and we talk about laws of supply and demand and
[12:32] so on and there is a law of supply and demand as long as you only have one form of exchange but once you start getting other media of exchange
[12:45] such as force then the law of supply and demand gets different beats on at different rhythms in a interest you to know that one of the D major question on
[13:00] my final examination for my science fiction course this last two two weeks ago was the asking the class to examine the effects of power in its various forms abuses and uses in two of the
[13:14] major works read during the semester and you're mentioning power just now as being the name of the game as far as Arrakis is concerned till you see
[13:26] Western man has assumed that if you have that all you need for any problem is enough force power um and that there is no problem which won't submit to this
[13:42] approach [Music] even even the problem of our own ignorance which if he throws it out the
[13:55] window right there because it's an asinine assumption and it is the basic fallacy of Western man's approach to living now I'm not saying that we immediately drop this and adopted the
[14:08] Dontos although that might not be a bad idea no we need what I would call a science of wisdom I think among the things that we need and this is indicated to a
[14:21] certain extent in the novel but we need a clear distinction in our minds in the minds of Western man between the ethical norm and the moral life the moral life
[14:34] is subject to change it is the law etc etc etc but the ethical norm are those things which we must do because they are the proper thing to do regardless of the law they're an abstract error they are
[14:48] an abstract and this conflict between the moral and the ethical norms we see obtaining in certain situations within doom as I recall well well the more least I could extrapolate yeah that's
[15:01] correct but look the moral norm is I saw it in dune was something that is imposed upon people by their environment yeah I mean it says fixed as how many wives a
[15:14] man in this culture might be able to support and thereby have or or what possessions he can carry from one stopping place to another and how this would control the moral laws they
[15:28] actually build up inside we see it in our society for example of out of our nomadic background and hurts miss background we see all kinds of moral injunctions which grew up
[15:40] out of that which we accept today logically I'm not trying to denigrate them but we can trace them this way now this is where moral law comes from
[15:52] ethical law takes a step in another direction and it says that I thinking animal see that the logical consequences
[16:04] of these moral actions are such as though and maybe I better modify the moral law slightly by a higher ethical law I find this then in one of the and some
[16:19] of the internal conflicts which are bothering Paul that the ethical norm which he sees as being an one of se absolute rightness as opposed with a the
[16:31] law of moral necessity and these are clashing in him these are tensions at work with the end Paul which caused him I think to have a depth of characterization that you do not normally find within the normal science
[16:43] fiction novel you hit under of course the way the character of Paul was constructed it was a conflict between of absolutes and the necessity of the moment yeah and it's almost an
[16:58] existential necessity incidentally as I caught it as I read it that's right that's absolutely right absolutely gee thanks sit down you see
[17:10] this is an exercise in I showing up you might say the fallacy of absolutism even to be absolutely about being non insolate because Paul is
[17:24] bothered with that very problem that rhymes how absolute can he be and get in his relationships with his subordinates with the still guard for example if he's
[17:37] - absolutely loses you know he gains up how did you put it in the novelty he saw he sees the loss of a friend and the gain of the worshipper almost I didn't gains of he loses a preference and
[17:52] gaining Tsar worship and worship her yes and this kind of conflict with you if he's - absolute here and not absolute there or in the necessity or in them
[18:03] when the tribe tries to force a pond Paul the apparent necessity for killing still gar and he has to talk to tribe out of one of their tribal rules nor tomorrow yeah right a moral rule immoral
[18:17] and you see how the moral rule was developed on the necessities of their background exactly and he has given them that an ethical role yes and yet this conflict is continual within Paul I think and it makes I think for certain
[18:32] added dimensions in the novel that again the normal science fiction novel does not have well you began to send in 53 you began doing research and filling file folders with facts and
[18:45] extrapolating to the the sand dune planet tell me further about the writing process itself well this was the first book
[18:59] where I really started carefully applying these ideas about the building of a rhythm within a story we do just define it's a little bit more for me I
[19:11] will be specific about it and I can use an analogy which is familiar to both of us poetry but it is used only as analogy
[19:21] okay you know how you choose a word in a given poem to control the beat of the poem are you from waiter quick Hopkins
[19:36] poem the wind / if not I'll get it up for you later and show you how there is one word in there which absolutely controls the total poem yeah this happens in many many poems yeah and the
[19:52] poem then develops a certain fixed rhythm now by changing the phraseology and placement of words you can change that rhythm you could slow it down you can speed it up well there is an
[20:06] analogous thing in prose I think this is yeah quite easily defensible with that length of sentence number one modifying clauses variety sentence structure
[20:19] variety of sentence structure all of these things control the pace of control reading or control controlled of silent reading or oral and I were Carly
[20:33] because I think that the language was spoken long before it was written and I think that unconsciously we still accept it as oral transmission that's something I'm going to have to
[20:47] try with some of my classes is reading parts of Duman aloud to them I've done this if God do this is the standard device in in when I think joy sir Yeats or Elliott I re great gobs of it a lot of the class well this was done
[21:01] deliberately as to control that oral case I by the length of sentence by the variety of sentence by the words in the second for the long convoluted words or
[21:14] shirt chopping word famous X anglo-saxon is against their Latin Lent I control the pace so I have several rhythms built
[21:27] into the story deliberately one is a long term rhythm and we'll get to the ending of the looking what is the ending is can I can
[21:40] deliberately and a number of people interesting we have seen it I wanted to say found a cheer action almost for the sake of action yes and overly dramatic
[21:53] maybe and you know in the future labor calls wives I said that almost but you call it high camp whom I hadn't thought of it that way well I wanted to change the story around
[22:06] them itself but in two very specific ways obviously you don't limit if you do the way it turns if you do that if you do one way string would know of one I
[22:19] was talking a little fun at the idea of the person who always sees things verbally and must write about them and record them you know the historicity of anything that happens to see you're not
[22:35] living it you're recording it yeah just we're doing right now yeah yeah we're having to say that again please man never he didn't accept service cam reviewer Tom sees the whole world you
[22:48] see and just do that little square for a project right yeah so I wanted to kind of get a little sticker about this you see right at the end and say you detected that shear action treatment
[23:02] there and you see how that this does what I'm describing yes and that is a limited point of view action of the shear action
[23:10] treatment yeah that's right and also by making it a amanda man battle at that point between
[23:26] Paul who is a an extremely complex character you know and this almost stick figure Black Sea who is sort of in many ways Paul's
[23:41] counterpart exactly he's a he's a foil in the classic sense of the word boy I would like to attend to another place right at this point he becomes that that impossible thing that non-existent thing
[23:54] the absolute evil yep you see there so if we turn the whole thing thrilling backward through the story there was another thing there if in the pacing of the story is very slow at the
[24:10] beginning of the colloidal rhythm all the way through the story it's a what a coil rhythm okay it's very slow paced increasing all the way through and when you get to the ending of it I've chopped
[24:22] it at a at a non breaking point so that the person reading the story skids out of the story trailing bits of it living now this I know I was successful because
[24:36] people come to me and say that they want more and I have said this to my classes that in many ways as satisfying as doing is I find it unsatisfying because there are so many unanswered questions you
[24:51] don't tie up the loose ends of safe Paul's sister unless you read what is the Huntress of a thousand worlds that marvelous little little foot those
[25:02] princes alia Bhatt or several other things the the whole question of the spacing guild itself and how it got to be the way it was is a handli very you know
[25:16] well let's extend something as far as fiction in general is concerned um now there are other reasons why stories are remembered and I'm talking about story and the classic sentiment of
[25:30] the genre who goes from Castle to Castle to earn his meal alright entertainment and the stories that are remembered are the ones that
[25:42] strike sparks from your mind one way or another it's like a grinding wheel they touch you and sparks fly whether this be something like the Millers tale of
[25:55] Chaucer or Sir Gawain and the grain of connection to a sleazy or well we could a deuce thousands of other examples of to say Treasure Island or or what you
[26:08] will there's sparks then okay and it's our return now we all have stories that we go on with after finishing reading them as children we can remember playing
[26:23] Treasure Island or playing Tom Sawyer or Tom Sawyer any of these we remember playing these the story stayed with us
[26:35] the characters and their conflicts their Joy's their play all state with us and it in Kindle sparks and our own imagination so that we have a little
[26:50] weed we were then active and creative play that's exactly right we went on and told the story ourselves young now I deliberately did this and do for that purpose I want the person to go on and
[27:02] construction for himself all of these marvelous flights of fantasy and imagination I wanted to you see you haven't had the spacing guild explained completely just
[27:17] enough so that you know its existence now with lots of people they've got to complete this yes so they build up in their own life yeah now this is right out of the story where's young or the whole lots of phone been a gesture at
[27:32] you pronounced it's been a gesture any gesture the their whole mystique and so on is relatively unexplained why do they want because that's how to rock in the first place you see is a road to the
[27:44] name of the game is power young and they want power that that explains it to a certain extent but they want power in a specific way a you know I've always been
[27:57] amazed by the statement or by the label of psychological warfare there could be no such thing as
[28:08] psychological warfare if you develop a psychological weapon sufficiently that
[28:20] it is destructive to any potential enemy it will destroy you with the enemy it's a two-edged sword without a handle and
[28:32] if you grab it hard enough to wield it you're going to do self-destructive yes so we could have a variation on the lord acton notion power corrupts both the
[28:48] user and the receiver of the power both absolutely right uh-huh Acton thought now how interesting I hadn't thought of the cruel power corrupts and not a very
[29:03] Jesuit see this you see how they keep themselves in the background yes that's true they want a user of power they can
[29:17] control I see with safety to them actually if I don't see devices huh yeah and I say that in several ways not in this way yeah
[29:29] not in this blatant way but in playing it with all of its presentations because they're much more to this we can go on for several hours discussing this aspect over the whole love attitude of Reverend
[29:44] Mother Gaius some way I am yeah for example Helen Gaius I am yes I see how we could various aspects of it well I'd like to I'd like to examine this a little bit further in some of the
[29:58] religious constructs before we get into the bouquet Title II I was up at Sonoma State last month to talk to a class up there and the question that seemed to
[30:11] attract the most attention from the class somebody asked back there what's all this nonsense about controlling people with voice oh yeah there seem to
[30:24] be a lot of agreement with this point of view that it's impossible to do this and so I think we do it all the time of course we do it and it's amazing to me that anybody could even begin to
[30:37] question this as a as a as a fact of our existence and they couldn't see it so I said well I'll give you an example I'm going to describe it a man to you you know this man

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
30:52] and I'm going to give you a task of controlling him by voice after I described it and after you recognize it I said this is a man who was in World
[31:05] War one as a sergeant came home from World War one to his small town in the Midwest married his childhood sweetheart and went into his father's business
[31:19] raised two children who he didn't understand they don't understand him he joined the VFW and the Legion went on every picnic every convention lived by
[31:37] the double standard II thought now on the telephone strictly fine voice I
[31:49] want you to make him mad any one of a hundred variation yeah certain yeah certificates thing in the world now what we're seeing here is that
[32:08] see I've drawn it grows Karen color of course letters but we're saying that if you know the individual well enough if you know the subtleties of his strengths
[32:20] and weaknesses that merely by the way you cast your voice by the words you select by the intonation whatever whatever you're right you can control them now if you can do it in a gross way
[32:34] obviously with refinement you can do it in much more subtle fashion and it does all the time in politics and this is one of the techniques incidentally the science fiction I think says it takes a possibility or something that does
[32:48] actually exist today and extrapolate from that perhaps refines it makes it more specific the science of control by voice yeah is that very in somatic three
[33:00] we get across what it was I met a message it's a well-recognized thing informatics and you see if Hayakawa uses
[33:13] the example of you're talking you've met somebody for the first time maybe in a business meeting at a convention and you've got acquaintance you're speaking
[33:25] you exchanged views at the end of it you say we must get together for lunch sometime now under one example of this the fellow will call you the next week
[33:41] or you'll call him and you will get together for lunch and he knows you're eat supposed to call you and make this luncheon date under the other example of the same phrase he knows that this is goodbye I don't care
[33:54] to talk to you anymore but it's the same phrase and they're both they're both polite oh yes and this is the meta message yeah the hidden message underneath the message and yeah you know
[34:08] I can understand that well I had I have no trouble understanding that question of the voice as I read the novel because among the other things which the novel gave to me it was the whole question of
[34:21] communication and how we communicate on multiple levels whether it be Paul communicating by shedding and tear that's an act of communication on a very profound level to the Freeman but
[34:38] whether or the communication of the voice of the communication by sword of communication by a dozen different ways that we all do constantly as we're doing in this room right now so you're communicating but in one sense by the
[34:51] way you're both watching me as I speak and watching Frank and watching the recorder and watching what you're doing with your hands there all sorts of communications just as I'm communicating and you are in a dozen hundreds of
[35:05] hidden different ways I have no problem with that in the novel and I thought it was rather well have done let me go off on another parenthesis here did you ever read the novel on Nostromo by Conrad no
[35:18] I was reminded very much as I read dumb Doon for the first time of the reaction that I had when I first read Nostromo I think that Nostromo is one of probably
[35:31] Conrad's greatest novel is certainly the most artistic achievement as well as his most profound and I found myself thinking about Nostromo as I read as I read Doon now I'm going to have to read
[35:45] it well I mean as very high praise because Nostromo is ultimately the creation of an entire universe it is the country of costaguana in Central America
[35:58] there is one thing in central Maine this country of costaguana that influences everybody and it is the presence of a gigantic silver mine and the silver corrupts everybody in the
[36:13] country there are one way or another it can corrupt the British people who are running the silver mine it corrupts the incorruptible Nostromo our man who is
[36:26] the sort of a folk hero of the thing yeah it corrupts everybody it totally controls the country and in watching how these people didn't relate to the problem of of asunder mind
[36:39] and the parallels there you say between doing and stromal to me as I read it as a professor of English we're we're very strong and this is one of the things I object to in among my own compatriots is
[36:54] that they are unable to see that something like Nostromo is in a very real sense a type of science fiction we have created a mythical country based upon reality where the people react in
[37:09] certain ways to things which we would react to in other ways but it's said over here just as the Fremen react to this my contention that in especially in doing and doing isn't an exposition of
[37:22] this point that man himself is going to change we have changed but our changes the the actual
[37:34] basic change is a gradual climb I don't see this is progress I see it as a sort of entropy and as a growth of complexity
[37:50] [Music] but that this is such a slow process that in thousands upon thousands upon thousands of years we would still
[38:00] recognize the emotions the reactions all of these things and given any set of forces which you can delineate the silver mine
[38:14] the geriatric spikes right the existence of certain hard lines of power control and communication as perhaps oversimplified by say these hard Conan's
[38:29] versus the Atreides yes families yeah you have a a classical feudal yes that's clear of
[38:40] it's my contention that feudalism is a natural condition of human beings not that it is the only condition not that it is the right condition but it is
[38:57] just a way we have a falling into organizations I like to use the example of the Berlin Museum navour's you ever
[39:09] come across this note well by the numbers are going to be wrong here but it's on this order yeah before World War two there were a number of families of Bieber in the Berlin Museum ever
[39:23] European Bieber they had been in there raised in captivity for something on the order of 70 beaver generations in cages
[39:37] world war two came along and a bomb free some of them into the countryside what did they do they went out they
[39:45] started building dams Wow Wow there's now a tribal organization feudalism it's tribal organization oh yes and that's
[40:01] what I'm talking about so tribal organization is a natural organization of humankind we tend to fall into it given any chance at all given the proper
[40:15] stresses or given the proper lack of stress and I think we could extrapolate from that notion and say we have many more feudal or tribal aspects in our society than we might have otherwise
[40:29] thought about it I would think that the existence of the Roman Catholic Church in its feudal state as long as it has existed is sort of proof of what you're saying the hippies are proof of it oh yeah the organization's they set up it's
[40:43] a tribal organizational business office you you know a company excuse me [Music] a University grad oh yes indeed an English department uh very true and
[40:57] wealthy of course what we're doing here is oversimplifying yes the complexities of it in the variations on the theme are multitude but the the framework is there
[41:10] the skeleton is there and you can recognize that skeleton so I set up the situation in Doom where the natural
[41:22] evolvement was a classic feudalism and for a very specific purpose I wanted the lines of power to be clear yeah at the same time feudal lines of
[41:37] power we're extremely we're extremely complicated I don't mean to contradict you but though I really like I said while I was example they were nonetheless multi-leveled yeah as you
[41:49] indicate with the Baron Harkonnen and the non Barone and and so on all of these things of the relationship to the Imperium this you want to go back to the 14th there no 14th century in England of
[42:04] the War of the Roses though by clear in that I meant in this sense recognizable by anybody who knows those the first damn thing about this precisely the thief is a set of obligations from top to bottom and from bottom to top mutual
[42:17] back and forth ultimately yeah it's a feedback that you exactly and this kind of thing the kind of loyalty to say gurney Halleck gave Paul yeah or gave Paul's father oh yeah this is the kind
[42:31] of thing that you the loyalty to the family yes certainly and I am the rightful Duke of treaties yes at the very end of the thing not as he is speaking this out our car gear announced
[42:43] in the Sutter car yeah very interesting I know my students have had a lot of fun tracing down the background of the Freeman as far back as they can from the
[42:56] hints you drop of the novel and coming to the surprise delighted surprised that they were once probably I'm SaLuSa secundus and that this accounts are part
[43:12] of the way they are even hardening there and further the tracing the lifecycle of Shia look is really an interesting thing for them because you don't quite
[43:25] complete the whole thing in your in the appendices because what if I set up there we know our information about the cyclic nature the interdependence in our own environment it's still quite sketchy
[43:38] in many areas but we do know this we know that you need to create large bodies of sand dust what not yeah any
[43:49] water actually sub anyway yeah oh so I've set up multitudes of creatures cool substitute for this yeah quite logical yeah they aren't they do
[44:04] this ah [Music] and I've postulated that in one vector
[44:14] of their life circle water is placed into them right we see this sort of thing down planet earth right now where a creature can
[44:32] live in what environment in one vector but that environment will kill it in another vector in the Anopheles mosquito is a good example and it doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to
[44:46] carry this further in that classic science fiction way saying that given other circumstances right on another planet a creature could develop something that we could see was announced
[45:02] and but would do these other things so there's another element of shy hello to shailu serves a specific function among other things story but a specific late
[45:15] looks function all right it's the unthinking Beast it's the black beast [Music] it's the personification of the bull in
[45:30] the arena not the way the bull in the arena actually is but the persona by mistake of the back the mystique of it and it there it is I never took the
[45:44] black beast has connotations that I never gave it may be it's my my taking it wrong from your terminology it's the the mythic beast to the the archetypal beast is they are entitled to me by
[45:58] black bees that's right nothing else because of your mentioned earlier of the tracing the archetypal backgrounds yeah and I meant it classically the
[46:09] archetypal black beast the one that lives underground in the cavern with the gold I see okay right so this is a dragon available who lives in the cave
[46:21] no guarding we go golden dagger right precisely incidentally frank baum use the in one of his Oz books use the
[46:31] dragon Garda hoarding gold guarding go well this that was why I put this in there it's a familiar any gold of course becomes the geriatric spikes x-ray in another element which I once figured out
[46:47] there one of my students figured out the geriatric spice itself is probably the defecated method which I and whether its vectors or it might have been no not not
[47:00] dedicated medical also no no wisdom the eggs perhaps way to heal and that's why they're guarded among other things the value of that one
[47:12] yeah yeah look true and lots of kids have lots of fun with this of course Lee and I did that delivery the value of a good story in the entertainment sense was how much of this it tips on how much it starts rolling
[47:28] sure so that you start creating your own story so what the Federal Emergency and in that sense there is no right answer to the final let's say complete lifecycle Shia hood yeah do you want me
[47:42] to pit it down for you I can I mean I had it in my head it in mind yeah but I had it worked out - let's let's compare notes well I'd be interested before I say anything it would good to hear what
[47:56] you had to say I got to get my book I'm going to turn this off for a minute now we're back again we were talking about the archetypal patterns in doom for a moment off on this tangent now well we got onto the sequel for well yeah and
[48:08] there's a point here that I think should be they is Campbell turned down the sequel hmm not his argument was that I
[48:19] had created an antihero in Paul in the sequel and he has built his magazine I'm oversimplifying grossly over substrain but this is the excellence of it really
[48:34] improve the accuracy yeah but he built his magazine on the hero now that's my contention that the difference between a hero and then antihero is where you stop
[48:47] the story and if you're true to life if you're true to life giving these these ingredients then the story goes on because human
[49:01] beings go on now you can confine your story to one individual and therefore as far as he's
[49:13] concerned story begins with birth demesne with death but if you're dealing with larger movements it the parameters are much broader that's right as they
[49:25] are this book yeah then there is no real ending it's just a place where you stop the story and one of the reasons by the way why in the book do I stop it the way I do
[49:40] deliberately building up a carrying momentum as though you were going down a slide and then just chopping it to a moment of triumph and then that's it and you skid out of the scenery with all of this cream - yeah I can see that you
[49:54] know but because I understand the Jungian archetype of pattern you know the Lord Raglan yes steps of the hero why don't aches up about the first 15 of them more or less and if I know nothing
[50:09] about the sequel other than a few words you've told me but I would be willing to predict that if you follow the pattern the archetypal hero battered he goes through many of the things that Lord
[50:22] Raglan sets out in the in the notion of the hero in the quest hero ultimately some fall has to die it's a question of how and under what circumstances and probably as a result
[50:37] of some of these tensions which have been previously operating yes several of them and one of them of course is the tension of prognostication yeah this is foreshadowed in here yeah he
[50:50] never sees his own death moment but he's always concerned about it yeah we bring this that's right we bring this to a head this idea that I'm expanding that you know when you talk to any of the
[51:04] average individual and he says oh I can only know everything that's going to happen tomorrow we might be wonderful pieces what he is talking about is the fifth grade at Hialeah yeah or will that girl say yes or no that's
[51:16] that's what he's talking about and he doesn't really want to know everything that's going to happen tomorrow because this is precisely what I do to Paul we
[51:28] carry this to its logical outcome they reach a point in the sequel where he is physically blind it is without sight I
[51:42] think this is what ii can't belong to those time well becomes an antihero in that sense yeah yeah yeah but here's Paul he's physically blinded and yet he knows everything everything it's going
[51:57] to happen he's lived this one before well think of how boring that is but think of how mysterious and terrifying they meet avoid everybody else you know a guy it would be as though I without sight you could see I have nothing but a couple of sockets here and my wife comes
[52:11] in and picks up a cigarette out of a package I lead over and lightest border and say it's a Pall Mall yes hey you're back to Pall Mall yeah I Paul does such things as grabbing a
[52:24] microphone out of the troopers hands and relaying orders immediately after the accident which is either lost and greeting people in the hallway as he passes them
[52:41] say well the question builds up this terrifying this odd head among the people around him but in also foreshadows they're turning against him because you know if a person really does this sort of thing to you you're going
[52:54] to get away from it one way or another hey crucifying yeah in in many ways they would I would I could I can see this and this would lead us to all sorts of
[53:05] possible symbolic interpretations of knowledge and some going back beautiful yeah it's like contention where I've always wondered about the eatable aspects of the oh they're there the
[53:18] novel but let's not go to that they're there and deliberately yeah the so it's my contention I think I'm probably right on this but the thing that got to Campbell was not that I had an antihero
[53:32] in this sense but that I had destroyed one of his gods Oh see because prediction and s o course with Campbell lets you know obviously
[53:46] yeah yeah you see if you know that the magazine is there are you sure I've been reading it since 1940 all right then you know that he is completely devoted to this I am and I'm not I go against him
[53:59] but I'm merely saying that this is just point of view and this folks a great deal of fun and not so much fun as it cooks a big hole the whole theory then yes it would be great to know everything that's going to happen tomorrow and so
[54:14] he rejected it if I rejected that he's in that huge the galaxy slapped it right up and pay Campbell's rate well well-known looking for another nebula for that animal I didn't even look for a nebula
[54:28] for the first one I didn't write it with that in mind all right my chief concern is to tell a good story it really is Virginia High Line says this too
[54:38] every time that Bob wanders away she says cut to the chase there's a classic
[54:52] Hollywood approach yeah well could we go back a little bit and tell us more about the the novel as it developed in your mind but you were going to do something though I was going to trace China
[55:05] looking for you well I can't quite do it completely without referring to the text and I'm afraid that most of it is given in the text but I think that the the question of the sand trout and the is
[55:19] one of the vectors from the sand trout to the dry leathery to the Sancho dry
[55:28] leathery think sand child to little maker to a trooper but took to the worm to the big look to the guess well but it goes to does little maker just go directly into the worm or is there
[55:44] another no less it goes directly into the matter in growth process from birth all right to to the to shallowed itself and then childhood spice I think becomes the eggs
[55:56] well the spy chromatic material a spy toward I conceived it was necessary for the development from let's say the pupil stage you know
[56:09] to go beyond the pupil stage they had to have be in the presence of the spices now that's the way I can see anything and I feel like Isis itself is almost as
[56:22] being spermatic material that's right then the Sykes growing into the all of the little maker / as I saw it is
[56:33] nothing like runs round it the way I thought is slightly different but I the
[56:42] spiced in the presence of a of a debt full verb yes to kill by the water of life then this becomes and you're off in the spice blow that's right right thing
[56:58] comes yeah the fee of the new life cycle yeah it's almost orgasmic in that sense that's right no probably deliberately yeah I know anything in there yell everything all the way throw it down
[57:11] how interesting well if we can go back then and talk about a little bit more about the formation of the novel from say 1953 and the terminal ideas and your
[57:24] file folders and so on rook up to about there a little while while ago line up to clearance rate certain age they don't concern me I know I'm more involved with
[57:40] the actual what on paper in front of our how long a writing process did this take them from the time you this began to the time you fazer actual physical writing run use of about
[57:53] two years about two years you wrote it when you're in Mexico felt I wrote here rose here oh but I had the idea Whitney in Mexico was adding to it if he were
[58:08] talking about two different things here the accumulation of data and the physical writing and the physical rhyme sitting down in front of paper next week putting a story down it's almost as though you're filling a container i co
[58:21] that has been pretty well built up stay outside it's interesting Harry Harrison describes the writing process with him
[58:33] rather well in a tape I made with him a few months ago he is absolutely uninterruptible from say 12:30 in the afternoon till five o'clock at night
[58:48] because the ideas as they form in his mind sort of become into the extension of its excuse me fingers in the typewriter and that they are up here and at the faith and that any interruption
[59:04] whether it be a telephone ringing or his wife knocking at the door or anything at all is liable to shatter that idea as it transforms itself into paper this is a very heaven exit thing yeah there's a I
[59:16] I have to fight this but that was very nice to me about that she keeps the writers children there and always they learn to tiptoe and his daddy ride agent in effect you SAT quiet
[59:30] you say your father is riding in silence what is your writing schedule well it varies depends on what I'm doing writing for the magazine down here but
[59:46] as a general rule it goes like this I'll get home somewhere around five o'clock when bath is here when she's not working as she has been the last couple of weeks she'll have dinner ready at
[01:00:00] that time very close to that time I'll then take an hours down and then work sometimes til one o'clock in the morning then I hit the sack and get up and
[01:00:15] sometimes if a story is strong to me I get up in the morning right you get up at five o'clock in the morning or so and right for an hour or two sometimes before going down to San Francisco to
[01:00:29] camp this is the thing I want to get out of because I can write eight hours a day in two bursts and I don't see any reason why I
[01:00:42] shouldn't be doing what I want writing what I want to write during those times I know temptations supporting myself entirely by science fiction writing in
[01:00:56] the sense of writing only science fiction of because I have other axes to grind to you know I'm going to do a a nonfiction book on air pollution for

01:01:11] example I really hit on this ecology thing the consequences of some of the things that we're doing to our planet and I don't mean in the lock it up and throw it away sense of the classic
[01:01:26] conservationist in other words turn it all in the wilderness I don't mean that but there are ways of living with our planet not against it and this is the attitude that we have to develop and it
[01:01:40] is an attitude Thank You mr. Keynes part of games so it is an additive sure it's it's something it has to be ingrained into us as children is my wife is fond of telling my
[01:01:53] children a fountain-pen is not a screwdriver very good and each has its own purpose for whatever it may be and if you misuse that thing it will turn
[01:02:08] around and bite you you'll ruin a screwdriver or ruin a bottle 10 and trying to make it work like a screwdriver and we're rapidly ruining our air our water our planet I've found that you're talking about the economics
[01:02:21] of writing and selling du has made made us at this point about $15,000 since the first sale this includes the sale of what was it something like eight chapters to
[01:02:37] Campbell that's right uh by the way uh I did not read it in analog I read it first in book form how much of it did appear in almost all almost all of it a
[01:02:48] good kick in fact in one set a little more because there were capsule
[01:02:57] recapitulation these synopses yes did you write those yes I didn't um the the
[01:03:09] way it comes in I found and this is broad for a novel it makes somewhere between five and seven thousand dollars on me in the first 12 months of sale
[01:03:27] and this depends on how far yourself how many times your sell it then I found that with my own work it'll go on training for a long time we received old several hundred dollars out of the
[01:03:42] Dragon in the sea this last year is that round yeah yeah but still on my favorites yeah still one of my favorites no it's still selling selling it
[01:03:53] beautifully in Japan I understand that you speak Japanese no no where did I hear that no I I don't speak Japanese I
[01:04:04] can read a bit of videogram that's so the sky absolutely sky high gothic but I was raised with Japanese Americans in
[01:04:19] the Pacific Northwest in an area where there were a great many of yahwah's put it that way place called fight between Seattle and Tacoma
[01:04:29] and Matt's up near glorious Tumwater yes it's north of time why often Olli fans that's it cuz I know that I would have brought in a recipe finally we have another YT page no I'm going to stick to coffee for a
[01:04:44] while thanks I'll be up all night reading but then what differences was making so anyway I was raised with them and eat in Japanese and I know a few
[01:04:56] phrases yeah I learned quite a while we were speaking of your writing plans for the future you say the sequel to dune will be out this fall sometime or
[01:05:09] earlier over there yeah possibly in October possibly earlier there's a some question I requested that it be holdup of it and I'm not sure that everyone's
[01:05:24] in agreement and maybe that's this I mean I'm not - you know I just thought it would be a better idea for several reasons so that we publish it earlier one of the reasons is that I have built a dude taro
[01:05:37] into the sequel and do that one again you know what the tarot deck is of course yes yeah okay yeah oh I missed that and I built a dude Terrell into it and that's hot right now yeah and I'm
[01:05:53] just thinking economically they ought to capitalize I'm sure why not I do tell well see I teach Yeats and Elliott and Marcella so I know yeah great a very well
[01:06:06] together yeah I guy I own my own private deck and we have one it's my contention that if you immerse a society in a great deal of what we call fortune-telling you
[01:06:20] know that you cloud the whole process boom you see what happened in classic times
[01:06:35] and in Greek the historic times when the Oracle was had terrifying accuracy the Eco cycle for example the word a lot of
[01:06:48] Oracle's around you went to Del Phi L Phi right or to the local madman you know the birds you cast a few Audry's here and there yeah and who might have
[01:07:02] might kill a chicken and look at the end rolls or note which way the blood spurts and react as you cut a batch item any
[01:07:12] one of these methods which I called ignition principles as far as prediction is concerned I contend that very such a
[01:07:25] thing that you can do it whether you do it by Oh a subliminal thing fifteen percept Hill this or whether it is a you
[01:07:38] use the petty perception in that scene in the conservatory and I thought was worked rather well done with them kind of spending that's right leaving that to the things for lady
[01:07:51] Jessica to pick up in parentheses yeah that's right well whether our predictive faculties are prophecy and we've had our profits is a product
[01:08:05] of an accumulation in the sense of a computer's accumulating data yeah or something mystical in the sense that it's unexplained thus far unexplained
[01:08:20] looking at it through Western eyes now you can undoubtedly see that it is that it's a mechanical scientific principle and if you get enough data to bear on it you'll understand it though this doesn't necessarily follow of course that we can
[01:08:35] understand everything in the universe ask me about the basic what I think is the basic fallacy in science all right what is the basic fallacy in science tell us pray tell you want to
[01:08:49] prognostication okay you know i think i think it's the idea that we can invent of course science fiction is based on
[01:08:58] this the idea that we can invent anything we imagine and having invented
[01:09:11] it we must use it and then live by the consequences of it exactly yeah now this is the Western see this is the Western fallacy and this is one of the great
[01:09:26] things about the East that it does not it's of course what we problem of it because they achieve their ignition by by methods that we can see are hogwash right
[01:09:40] and or we misinterpret their methods for example if we were to consider say the tantric yoga or all we would think of is that you know either achieving Nirvana by means of sex and it's much more than
[01:09:52] that yeah for as one specific example we we take only one aspect of it and make sort of an end of it well there you go back to the slitting the neck of the chicken and watching which way the blood spurt yeah you see
[01:10:06] what I'm saying by ignition huh this ignites a you see you have that confidence that you can do it you have to believe you can do it and believe you can do it
[01:10:18] the process is ignited by any one of a million methods we've experimented with many the direction the bird flier or any of this is a well I have a student a few
[01:10:31] years ago who's whose wife was so accurate with the Tarot debt that she stopped using it completely I was told she frightened herself I terrified a gal
[01:10:43] one time little bit I was about ten teen we were uh sitting in a her aunt's house that her aunt and an uncle were out of sight but within hearing distance endow
[01:10:57] them with some stacks of their libraries which was nearby we were sitting across them from each other on Catholics the mouth of the fireplace a big stone fireplace between
[01:11:10] us elope down the embers we'd been out on a date I brought her home we didn't have anything going this she was just a gal I knew I hadn't have had a crush on her younger sister and and she knew it
[01:11:23] it and unrequited love at seventeen is a hideous thing you know oh yeah anyway that was a there was a great upsurge of Ryan consciousness at the time
[01:11:39] predicting the cards of course our interpretation of predicting the cars was you know wielding the one kind of cars I was a decade card sure so she broke out a brand new deck of cards and shuffle them we've been talking about it
[01:11:52] on the way home and quick shadowy over there was the firelight and the Pat was sitting across the fireplace and the light from where her aunt and uncle were playing cribbage
[01:12:07] in the back and they're both of them death by the way and you can hear this 15-2 and Joey faucet right all right killing Herod X Y a that's right well there was a light from Beckham in so she could see the cars and she said see if you can predict the car cheap and
[01:12:21] shuffling a busy so she picked up the first car and I closed my eyes and I saw that car so I told her that was it did you put it down that's the car I swear
[01:12:35] you will I went through that entire deck addicting every card that she was going to see and there wasn't a failure at all I told her every kind as it is the same way every time now whether I saw a reflection in her eyes in other words we go back in 50
[01:12:48] percent - yeah or whether this was some actual keyed in transmission we were sympathic over something tuned in on our way of life empathy rampant to this day
[01:13:01] atmosphere uh I don't know what it was but I predicted what the cards were and I said my goodness Isis fascinating do it again show them again so she shuffled the deck again and cut them a few times
[01:13:14] we start going through it again hmm and we got down old five or six cards into the deck and suddenly she threw the whole deck down on the part of the fireplace but scared of me I don't do this anymore hmm
[01:13:28] do you ever have that kind of success never never again but it was a um the odds against being able to do this by
[01:13:38] anything but some unrecognized contact or force because I'm not ruling out the fact that I may have seen she wasn't wearing glasses but the light may have been such that without even recognized
[01:13:54] and I saw a reflection of them in her eyes or something of that nature this is possible there are more things to extender for ratios are dreamt of all Oh will well
[01:14:08] you manage especially like that particular teacher don't you think I like to ask a couple of more questions I wanted to talk about the religious
[01:14:21] constructs behind the novel it's obvious that some of the Arabian mystique is there yeah and I think any perceptive reader can pick this up but part of the
[01:14:34] questions relates to the identity of Paul as a as an avatar as a new Messiah right or is a new prophet or what you will we can kind of talk about that a
[01:14:48] little for one of the one of the threads in the story is to trace a possible way a messiah is created in our society and I hope I was successful in in making it
[01:15:01] believable here we have the entire process or at least the large in some of the subtle elements of the construction of this both from the individual standpoint and from the way society
[01:15:15] demands this subject it's the reference in there you know that the man must recognize the NIP he is living in because the creation of an
[01:15:27] avatar is a myth making process we've done it in art in recent times look at what's happening to John F Kennedy torture for with a very earthy
[01:15:38] real yes and not totally Coley mad yes yes so here we have a likeable person now you see here but real in the flesh
[01:15:54] and blood sense who by the process of emulation become something larger than
[01:16:03] life are well and I just explored all as many permutations as I could recognize in the process well I caught overtones of Lawrence Arabia in the thing he could
[01:16:19] very well would become another time for the Arabs right if Lawrence of Arabia had died at the crucial moment of the
[01:16:32] British say when Allenby walked into Jews yeah if he had died if if for example he had gone up and killed the people who were destroying his dream yeah
[01:16:45] walked into that conference said gentlemen I have here under manager Bala a surprise my bang bang and he has been killed
[01:16:56] even deified he was the deified and it would have been the most terrifying thing we should ever encounter because the Arabs would have swept that entire
[01:17:09] peninsula with that social possibilities one of the things we've done in our society is exploited to this power let you learn has exploited this avatar power well if I could ask them one more
[01:17:29] question along this same line you mentioned a little bit earlier that you studied comparative religion at one time or our student of it was it from your experience in reading and comparative religions that brought
[01:17:43] you to this particular notion of an avatar that was part of it of course it was ignited by the idea by the ideas that I encountered in reading
[01:17:53] about desert societies yeah and I think that the idea of the way Western society has exploited this force we have yeah
[01:18:06] we've used it as a quick consciousness we've set out our missionaries and to do our dirty work for us and then come along behind them with the certain belief that we are
[01:18:19] right in anything that we can right now because God has told us so you know God in the person with the opposite well one one last personal question then it's one last personal question that if you don't
[01:18:33] mind do you profess any specific religion yourself we mentioned the data earlier or other backgrounds I'm a little curious if it's not at all pertinent I say so oh I don't right thanks I mean isn't that I don't really protect the religion
[01:18:48] in the sense that they normally recognize religion I believe in more in self-development in Zen set well I caught those the Zen elements
[01:19:02] from time to time I thought in in dune and in fact of all Zen Zuni school I thought was an aspect of that you know don't you that one element of the construction of this book it's all the
[01:19:17] way through there that I wrote certain parts of it in haiku and other political forms and then expanded them to prose to
[01:19:28] create a pace I hadn't picked those out specifically but died I sort of caught something of that and that's some of my friends have come back to me with the examples out of it said was this a I

[15:00] condition they call Peace even as they speak they create the seeds of turmoil and violence if they find their quiet security they squirm in it how boring
[15:12] they find it look at them now look at what they do while I record these words ha I give them enduring eons of enforced Tranquility which plods on and on
[15:26] despite their every effort to escape into chaos believe me the memory of Leo's peace shall abide with them forever they will seek their quiet
[15:39] security thereafter only with Extreme Caution and steadfast preparation when the tyranny of the worm God Emperor leato finally ended there
[15:53] was a great scattering under the rule of the god Emperor the people of the Imperium lived peacefully but not happily leato had exposed the Deep anxiety that existed within all of
[16:07] humankind a kind of restlessness deep rooted within a collected human consciousness when they were finally allowed to travel throughout the Universe freely Humanity spread well
[16:20] beyond the reaches of the Imperium into the vastness of space ensuring the survival and the diversity of the species but leato had done
[16:32] something else to humanity he had taken over the Ben jeser breeding program but used it for a different purpose after generations of trying Leo created
[16:45] CA only she was blocked from his vision leato introduced a no genene into humanity and following the famine times preceding Leo's death this Gene was
[16:59] spread out through the reaches of space ensuring that never again could all of humanity be seen by prean leato foresaw an
[17:11] enemy The Great enemy threatening all of humanity something that would use prean to seek out and destroy all of humanity by breeding this no Gene leato saved
[17:25] Humanity from this threat at his death leato II went back into oracus the individual sand trout of his skin separating and returning to the
[17:39] Sands the new worms that would form from them would each have a pieace of the god Emperor inside they would be more intelligent and more terrible than the worms of ancient
[17:53] oracus the events of the last two novels in Frank Herbert's original Doom Saga take place 1500 years after the death of the god Emperor at this point the planet
[18:06] oracus which had been terraformed by the god Emperor has returned to Desert the Great Sand worms have returned and brought with them a new flow of the spice malange a new civilization has
[18:21] arisen during the chaos of the famine times and the great scattering this civilization is made of of three major players the iians whose no ships have the ability to navigate
[18:34] space without the use of spice mange alongside the bacs who have learned to create spice within their axotal tanks and who have manufactured a new kind of shape-shifting face
[18:48] dancer and of course the ever evolving B jeser Sisterhood and it is also at this time a millennia and a half after after the death of leato II that some from the
[19:02] scattering began to return among them are the honored matr a violent matriarchal order of women who were selectively bred and taught powerful skills of combat and
[19:16] gain power through the sexual control of others especially men they seek to control the old Empire with violent force and gain B JZ knowledge lost to them certain characteristics along with the military and sexual skills possessed
[19:30] by the honored matr seems to indicate that they are in fact the result of a combination of the fish speakers who were the female Servants of the god Emperor leato II and the Ben jzr who fled out into the scattering 1500 years
[19:44] earlier an honored mree of the scattering demanded his presence a PA of paas descendants of tacu from the scattering had told him all they could about these terrible women
[19:59] far more terrible than the Reverend mothers of the B jeser they said and more numerous Waf reminded himself the honored matr make several attacks on the bzr planets throughout the bounds of the
[20:13] old Empire including lampidis a world which contained their most PRI School the other matr eventually even scorched the surface of the planet ARA as itself killing every sandworm in existence except for the one the B JZ sister could escapes with the worm they had taken
[20:28] contained a pearl of the god Emperor leato II's awareness in response to the destruction caused by the honored matr the B jeserich now led by darwi o'r a descendant of Paul L Tres continues to develop her plan to defeat the honored
[20:42] matr the B jesid have shielded their secret Planet chapter house behind a wall of no ships which cannot be seen by long range scans and also cannot be penetrated by the powers of prean it is here on the planet chapter
[20:57] house that they specifically Shan brug begin to breed the sandworms by Drowning the worm they saved from oracus in a mixture of spice and water they force this creature back into its earlier form it becomes Manny sand trout and so the
[21:11] cycle begins again The Sisterhood terraforms the planet Chapter House to accommodate the worms slowly Chapter House begins to form into a desert Planet a mirror of what Dune had once been Shiana was a girl born on a racus
[21:26] who discovered at a young age that she had the ability to control the desert worms who each inside contained a pearl of the god Emperor lato II some said she had been the sand riter
[21:38] predicted by leer II eons ago at this point the entire T laxu civilization has been mostly destroyed by the honored matr the only remaining Survivor is sael who offers up secret tacu knowledge to
[21:53] the Ben JZ in exchange for protection from the matr the Ben jzr for the first first time now have access to the T laxu secret of goola production which they used to produce agola of od's Father miles teg the atres military leader who
[22:08] was killed a book earlier after unlocking strange abilities agola is a kind of Clone on chapter house the B jzd also keep two prisoners on board a no ship a Duncan Idaho goola produced by the T laxu this goola has the memories
[22:22] of all previous Duncan Idaho golas knowledge stretching back since the time of leato the the Benz were interested in the god Emperor's fixation on Duncan Idaho and merbella a former honored
[22:34] matre who the Ben jzr have taken as a novice this Duncan Idaho goola also has a kind of preent vision in it he glimpses an older man and woman staring back at him he is very confused by the
[22:50] Visions he is seeing but does not mention them to the bz he wonders about the strange man and woman he had seen if it is revealed in the final two novels that the honored matr were fleeing an unknown enemy out of the scattering the
[23:03] enemy was more powerful and had conquered the hon mre's own large empire which had formed in the scattering it is unclear whether or not this is the great enemy that leato II forsaw but it was likely a powerful threat to humanity
[23:17] nonetheless in the end odra stages an attack on the honored matr striking the planet Gamu Victory seems near for The Sisterhood until the honored mre's Rel a powerful weapon brought out of the
[23:30] scattering a weapon of bloodless death odra realizes the Trap too late and is captured merbella the former honored mree who has shared memories with odrade
[23:42] Pilots a small craft down to the surface she uses the chaos to her Advantage telling the matr that she has escaped the Ben jzd and possesses all of their secrets but when she came face to face
[23:55] with the great honored mree now logno she uses the benzar power of voice to provoke her logno is easily manipulated due to marbella's Benes training your
[24:08] fluency and lies does not hide them merbella said she swept a scornful gaze across the ones behind log no like the ones I know in other memory you are
[24:21] headed for extinction the problem is you take so infernally long at dying inevit but oh the boredom meanwhile you dare call yourself great honored mree
[24:33] returning her attention to logno everything about you is a Cess pool you have no style it was too much logno attacked left foot slashing outward with
[24:46] blinding speed merbella grasped the foot as she would catch a wind blown leaf and continuing the flow of it levered logno onto a threshing Club that ended with her head pulped on the floor without
[25:01] pausing merbella petted left foot almost decapitating the honored MRE who had stood at logo's right the right hand crushing the throat of the one who had stood at logo's left it was all over in two
[25:16] heartbeats merbella kills the honored matre leader logno and as was their way the matr are forced to accept her as their leader noting her prowess in combat mbella again shares memories with
[25:29] the dying odrade solidifying herself as the Reverend mother of the Ben JZ as well as the leader of the honored matr not all B jzr accept marbella's Ascension however Shana who has also
[25:46] shared memories with odr before leaving Chapter House escapes into a no ship where she has brought some of the new worms which were born from the chapter house desert
[25:58] she leaves along with Duncan Idaho sael and Miles T merbella realizes their plans too late and is unable to intervene in the final chapter of the
[26:11] Dune series it is revealed that the man and woman glimpsed in pressence by Duncan Idaho are named Daniel and Marty the two referred to themselves as face
[26:24] dancers who for thousands of years had been the shape-shifting minions of the tacu capable of absorbing memories and taking the form of other people they have had such a hard time
[26:39] accepting that face dancers can be independent of them I don't see why it's a natural consequence they gave us the power to absorb the memories and experiences of
[26:53] other people gather enough of those and it's personas we take Marty whatever the master should have known we would gather enough of them one
[27:05] day to make our own decisions about our future the two hint that they observe and are familiar with various groups in the universe and for some reason are very interested in capturing and
[27:21] studying the passengers of Duncan's noip the role or purpose of these two was never revealed in Frank Herbert's original six Doom novels their
[27:33] technology seems to be almost Godlike Duncan 2 recognizes them as face dancers and understands that the two belong to no one but themselves the final novel in Frank
[27:48] Herbert's Dune series ends on a cliffhanger for Herbert did not live to complete the seventh novel planned for the series several questions are left unanswered What Becomes of the merging
[28:02] of the honored matr and the B jzer what are the fates of those escaping on the no ship who are these Godlike characters in chapter House's
[28:14] final chapter and of course what exactly chased the honored matr back into the old Empire in the first place these are merely the events of the
[28:27] Dune Saga Dune is a humanist book series that is highly concerned with the cycles of governmental systems Dune shows how the masses can be manipulated through religion and social engineering Dune
[28:42] explores the damage that can be caused by the joining of government and religious Faith most of all Dune exposes the cycles of humanity and the constant structure of giving and taking that is

[32:20] Guild whose preent powers granted by the spice mange make safe and instantaneous space travel throughout the Universe possible the galactic feudal Empire which would arise after the butlerian
[32:33] Jihad would last for many thousands of years until the rise of the god Emperor at the start of Dune the human race has scattered throughout the Galaxy and populated many planets each ruled by
[32:47] aristocratic houses who each owe their loyalty to the Imperial house Corino Emperor shadom Corino IV now s the Imperial IAL throne in this time the Lancer was the group that represented
[33:01] all the great houses throughout the Galaxy within the lanc cerad the High Council ruled and was overseen by the emperor at the start of dun the emperor has grown to fear house at trodes the
[33:15] Duke leato at trodes had become more and more popular within the lanered and it was said that the talent of Leo's own fighting force was beginning to rival the emperor's own dreaded imp Imperial
[33:27] Sardar Soldiers the emperor shadam Kino IV decided that he must do away with house atres the feud between the atres and the har conans had been going on for centuries the emperor would use this to
[33:42] his Advantage the planet oracus was currently lorded over by the genius and Despicable Baron Vladimir Honan with the help of the baron the emperor created a plan designed to trap and eliminate
[33:56] houses atres the Thom of the desert Planet oracus the source of the spice mange had been given over to the Duke leato atraes but the gift was poisoned
[34:08] and house atraes expected as much the Duke leato atres lived the majority of his life on the paradise world of kaladan in the 20 years prior to the start of dun he had ruled over the
[34:23] planet with his concubine the B jeser lady Jessica by his side Jessica was the result of the Benny jeser breeding program The Sisterhood had intended to breed her with the Duke
[34:34] leato and produce a daughter who could then breed with a haran son this Union they believed would produce their quizat hatak the lady Jessica was provided with
[34:47] the most advanced B jesar training available and carried the fate of The Sisterhood within her genes but she betrayed them her love for leato eventually grew so strong that Jessica
[35:01] disobeyed her orders to have only daughters and produced a son their first child Paul at trades in doing this Jessica not only disobeyed direct orders
[35:13] from The Sisterhood she betrayed a general understanding held within The Sisterhood the B jate are Beyond love love had nothing to do with it Reverend
[35:26] mother did not act from such mundane motives love clouded reason it diverted the sisters from their duties love could be tolerated only where it caused no immediate and obvious disruptions or
[35:41] where it served the larger purposes of the Ben jarat otherwise it was to be avoided always though it remained an object of disquieting watchfulness a
[35:54] life without love can be devoted more intensely to The Sisterhood love damnable love weakening love love leads to misery The Sisterhood
[36:08] had planned to breed Jessica's daughter with a haran son uniting the two houses and producing their long awaited quizat hatak but now they would have to adapt
[36:20] their plans the son Paul was raised on caladan and trained in the bzr when The Sisterhood realized what Jessica had done they were Furious but
[36:32] the B jerit adapt and the boy was either the quizat tatarak or he was not accompanying house at trodes to araus were several servants and teachers

[37:38] hunter Seeker attacks Paul in his room and nearly kills him Paul slipped out of bed headed for the bookcase door that opened into the closet he stopped at the sound behind him turned the carved
[37:53] headboard of the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping Paul froze and immobility saved his life from behind the headboard slipped a tiny
[38:04] Hunter Seeker no more than 5 cm long Paul recognized it at once a common assassination weapon that every child of Royal Blood learned about at an early age it was a ravening sliver of metal
[38:20] Guided by some nearby hand and eye it could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ Paul knows that if he calls for help the device will kill whoever
[38:33] opens the door he manages to survive the situation by utilizing his unique skill set and ultimately destroying the device in doing so Paul also Saves a Life of
[38:46] fan housekeeper the shout out Mapes as thanks she gives Paul a valuable piece of information there is a traitor in their midst though she canot not say who Duke leato is furious over the attempt
[39:00] on his 15-year-old son's life Paul tells his father of the traitor in their midst and leato admits to discussing the possibility several times before with the traes mtat thuir howt when speaking
[39:14] with thuir later leer receives another piece of information a scrap of a letter bearing the baron haran's own seal has been discovered and it seems to identify the the
[39:27] traitor it says AEL will never suspect and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand its source alone should be enough to destroy him the note was Under The Baron's own
[39:42] seal and I've authenticated the seal your suspicion is obvious the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold I'd sooner cut off my arms than hurt you
[39:53] howt said my Lord what if the lady Jessica leato said and he felt the anger consuming him couldn't you ring the facts out of this party unfortunately party was no longer among the living
[40:09] when we intercepted the corer the corer I'm certain did not know what he carried I see leato shook his head thinking what a slimy piece of business there can't be
[40:23] anything in it I know my woman my my Lord if no the Duke bar there is a mistake here that we cannot ignore it my Lord she's been with me for 16 years
[40:37] there have been countless opportunities for you yourself investigated the school and the woman howt spoke bitterly things have been known to escape me it's
[40:51] impossible I tell you the Honan want to destroy the atres line meaning Paul too they've already tried once could a woman conspire against her own
[41:03] son in the days before House of trodes left the planet kaladan for Dune the Benny jeser Reverend mother gas Helen moim came to visit the lady Jessica Jessica had betrayed The Sisterhood used
[41:18] her Ben jeser skills to Bear a son against their orders and trained him in the benzar way the sister hood is furious with Jessica for her transgression but the boy Paul must be
[41:31] tested with the gum Jabar nonetheless the G Jabar which is also known as the high-handed enemy is a metas cyanide poisoned needle that sits upon a thimble which is attached to a
[41:45] person's fingertip the B jzer make use of the gum Jabar when they test the humanity of certain people the device would be held against the person's neck and used used as a deterrent for the
[41:57] person backing out of the test this test would be to find out whether or not a person had enough control over themselves body and mind to override
[42:10] their instincts to end their suffering and the test did involve a great amount of physical suffering one does not obtain food safety Freedom by Instinct alone animal
[42:23] Consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct an animal destroys and does not produce animal Pleasures remain close to sensation
[42:37] levels and avoid the perceptual the human requires a background grid through which to see his Universe focused Consciousness by choice this forms your
[42:49] grid bily Integrity follows nerve blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs all things cells beings are impermanent strive for flow permanence
[43:03] within the test of the gam Jabar was so that the B jzer could find out exactly who Paul atraes was could he control
[43:16] himself in the face of great pain was he a liability to The Sisterhood and their minations Paul was raised outside of their control on the world of
[43:29] kaladan they needed to test him to find out how they could most optimally use him or if they even could there was in fact a possibility that he should be terminated alt together the Ben jzr
[43:43] operate through manipulation she only gives Paul some of the truth it is a test of awareness a test of human will but it is also so much more the Reverend
[43:56] mother is gathering information creating a profile the actions of the Ben jzr are always layered and often their simplest of actions possess many significant
[44:09] implications Paul in fact ends up withstanding more pain than any female child before had with stod Paul passes the test he is human the Reverend mother
[44:22] then tells Paul of the quizat hadak and of his foretold power and also of the fact that any man before who has been tested for being the quizat haak had died the Reverend mother then reveals to
[44:36] Paul and Jessica a terrible prophecy when you live upon arus she said kala the land is empty the moons
[44:48] will be your friends the son your enemy Paul sensed his mother come up beside him away from from her post guarding the door she had looked at the Reverend
[44:59] mother and asked do you see no hope your reverence not for the father Helen Mam's words seemed to suggest that something terrible will befall house at Tres after
[45:13] its arrival on oracus and the Duke will not survive leato did not truly believed that Jessica was the traitor he knew that the letter was merely a ploy by the
[45:25] baron AR Conan to wound and confuse house at trodes THU howt however does not trust Jessica Jessica discovers howt mistrust of her when a drunken Duncan
[45:38] Idaho stumbles into the atraes castle and reveals that he too suspects Jessica the lady Jessica is shocked and confused by this Revelation and attempts to convince Howard that his beliefs are
[45:51] illogical Jessica tries to explain that it is more logical to believe believe that it is the har conans that are making him suspicious of her but howt will not listen Jessica decides that the
[46:04] only way to convince howt that she is innocent is to prove that if she wanted leato Dead she could have done so long ago I don't trust your B jerat motives he said you may think you can look
[46:19] through a man you may think you can make a man do exactly what you you poor fool through fear she raged he scowled pushing himself back in the chair whatever rumors you've heard about our
[46:32] schools she said the truth is far greater if I wish to destroy the duke or you or any other person within my reach you could not stop me and she thought
[46:46] why do I let Pride Drive such words out of me this is not the way I was trained this is not how I must shocked him how it slipped slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of
[46:59] poison darts she wears no Shield he thought is this a brag she makes I could slay her now but ah the consequences if I am wrong Jessica saw the gesture
[47:12] towards his pocket said let us pray violence shall never be necessary between us a worthy prayer he agreed meanwhile the sickness spreads Among Us
[47:24] she said I must must ask you again isn't it more reasonable to suppose that the har conans have planted this suspicion to pit the two of us against each other we appear to have returned to stalemate
[47:38] he said she sighed thinking he's almost ready for it the Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people she said the position he hasn't married you
[47:51] how it said she forced herself to calmness thinking a good repost that but he'll not marry anyone else she said not as long as I live and we are surrogates
[48:05] as I've said to break up this natural order in our Affairs to disturb disrupt and confuse us which Target offers itself most enticingly to the har conans
[48:19] he sens the direction she was taking and his brows Drew down in a lowering scowl the Duke she asked attractive Target yes but no one with the possible exception
[48:31] of Paul is better guarded me I tempt them surely but they must know the Benny jeser make difficult targets and there is a better Target one whose duties create necessarily a monstrous blind
[48:46] spot one to whom suspicion is as natural as breathing one who builds his entire life on inuendo and M myy she darted her right hand toward him you how it started
[49:00] to LEAP from his chair I have not dismissed you through fear she flared the old mtad almost fell back into the chair so quickly did his muscles betray him she smiled without mirth now you
[49:15] know something of the real training they give us she said how it tried to swallow in a dry throat her command had been Regal preemptive uttered in a tone and manner that he found completely
[49:30] irresistible his body had obeyed her before he could think about it nothing could have prevented his response not logic not passionate anger nothing to do
[49:43] what she had done spoke of a sensitive intimate knowledge of the person thus commanded a depth control he had not dreamed possible she had used the mini jeser power of voice on him forcing him
[49:57] to obey her words this however does not go as planed instead of thuir being more confident in the fact that lady Jessica is not interested in hurting leato thuir is even more Disturbed and considers
[50:12] Jessica even more dangerous than he had before but Jessica was not the traitor there is a traitor amongst them but someone that could have never been suspected all the while house at Tres
[50:27] had been on arus the baron Vladimir Honan had been plotting their destruction he indeed planted the letter to frame Jessica and to move suspicion even further away from the true traitor
[50:40] the baron Haron is a monstrosity of a man a sadistic pedophile and rapist he is grossly fat and must be held up by suspencers despite of all this the baron is also a
[50:53] genius and is recognized for his his remarkable Insight in knowing people this is demonstrated in the way he has developed the roles of his nephews the bruus glasur raban and The Baron's
[51:05] favored fade rala and also demonstrated in the maintenance of The Baron's own mtat the Twisted pyer de the baron has proven throughout his time as the leader of a major house to be incredibly cruel
[51:20] and has earned house har Conan its reputation slavery murder and torture on a wide scale find no fault in The Baron's mind the har conans and the atres have been feuding for Generations
[51:34] the baron now had the chance to destroy the house once and for all and with the emperor backing him he did not know how he could fail and he knew that the traitor amongst the atres would not be
[51:46] detected because he had recruited the help of a man conditioned against doing harm to eliminate house at trodes Vladimir har Conan had taken the soup Dr
[51:59] yui's wife Moana prisoner threatening her with torture and even death unless yui complies with his demands Dr yui would go down as the first instance ever
[52:11] of Imperial conditioning being broken yui could avoid detection from Jessica's truth sensing abilities due to the skills he had learned from his wife Wana who was trained by the B jerat school as well under the the cover of night house
[52:26] har Conan launches a devastating attack on house at trodes yui disables the protective Shields around the atra's palace and house atra soon falls to the emperor's own Sardar soldiers disguised
[52:40] as Harin the emperor does not wish his hand in this to be known leato and Jessica and Paul are sedated with drugs yui also replaces one of the Duke's teeth with a false one that could emit a
[52:54] poisoned gas yui encourages the Duke to kill the baron with the poison gas when he is close enough to him the Duke himself would die as well but the baron would be no
[53:07] more leato is taken prisoner by the baron and Jessica and Paul are taken to the Deep desert to die in the sun without still suits or be consumed by the sandworms survival on AR racus is brutal
[53:21] water is the most precious thing on the planet rather than spice Frank Herbert has stated that the scarcity of water on AR racus is meant to be an analog for the scarcity of oil on Earth the surface
[53:33] of the planet is almost entirely dry Dune deserts hence the planet's less formal name Dune the heat in the desert is sweltering and miserable without a
[53:46] still suit to recycle the body's water one will be dead within hours during the daytime the fan inhabitants of the desert even with still suits only travel at night while in the owner thopter a
[54:01] flying vehicle driven by Haron and henchmen Paul and Jessica used their Ben jeser skills to get free of their bondage understanding some of the strange Powers possessed by students of
[54:14] The Sisterhood the baren insisted that the lady Jessica be gagged the entire time he also insisted that one of the three captors be deaf and therefore immune to Jessica's ability of voice
[54:27] Paul for the first time manages to use the Ben deser power of voice convincing the men to remove Jessica's gag and when it is done the highly skilled Jessica manipulates one man to kill the other
[54:42] and remove Paul's bonds as well Paul then skillfully crushes the man's heart killing him instantly this is the first man Paul has ever killed hidden within
[54:54] the or thopter Paul and Jessica discover a bundle containing Leo's ducal ring still suits food and other Provisions clearly this bundle was left by the doctor yui he is the only one that would
[55:08] have had access to the thopter and Leo's ring yui does this out of some sense of guilt and responsibility for his betrayal of house at trodes after the assault on house at
[55:21] trodes yui finally confronts the baron demanding to know what has become of his wife and as yui has already suspected the baron had killed her but no matter
[55:33] to him he had already set a deadly trap for the baron Dr yui was killed then by The Baron's Twisted mint at pyer and would forever go down in history as a traitor the baron then has Duke leato
[55:48] brought to him he demands to know where Jessica and Paul have fled but the Duke truly does not know and would never tell the Despicable Baron even if he did the baron threatens to torture the Duke but
[56:02] leato remembers the secret weapon that Dr yui had planted on him leato stared across the table wondering why he waited the tooth would end it all quickly still
[56:15] it had been good much of his life he found himself remembering an antenna kite up dangling in the Shell Blue Sky of caled den and Paul laughing with joy
[56:28] at the sight of it and he remembered the sunrise here on oracus colored strata of The Shield wall mellowed by dust Haze too bad the baron muttered he pushed
[56:42] himself back from the table stood up lightly in his suspensors and hesitated seeing a change come over the Duke he saw the man draw a deep breath jawline
[56:54] stiffen the Ripple of muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut how he fears me the baron thought shocked by the fear that the baron might Escape him leato bit sharply on the capsule tooth
[57:08] felt it break opened his mouth and expelled the biting Vapor he could taste it as it formed on his tongue the baron grew smaller a figure seen in a tightening tunnel leato heard a gasp
[57:20] beside his ear the silky voiced one pyer I got him too pter what's wrong the rumbling voice was Far Away leato sensed memories rolling in his mind the old toothless mutterings
[57:34] of hags the room the table the baron the pair of terrified eyes blw within blue the eyes all compressed around him in ruined symmetry there was a man with a
[57:47] boot toe chin a toy man falling the toy man had a broken nose slanted to the left and offbeat metronome caught Forever at the start of an upward stroke leato heard the crash of Crockery so
[58:01] distant a roaring in his ears his mind was a bin Without End catching everything everything that had ever been every shout every whisper every silence
[58:15] one thought remained to him leato saw it in formless light rays of black the day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes the thought struck him with a
[58:28] sense of fullness he knew he could never explain silence the Twisted mtat pyer is killed instantly and the rest of the men in the room die as well including The
[58:41] Noble Duke leato but the baren manages to escape in the nick of time and preserves his own life now lost in the desert Paul and Jessica must find a way to survive
[58:55] it is during this time however that Paul's Powers truly begin to awaken Paul sense the hyper alertness of his mind reading her reactions Computing on minutia you see it now he said
[59:10] satellites watch the terrain below there are things in the Deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection you're suggesting that the guild itself controls this planet she
[59:22] was so slow no he said the Freeman they are paying the guild for privacy paying in a coin that is freely available to anyone with desert power
[59:36] spice this is more than a second approximation answer this is the straight line computation depend on it Paul Jessica said you're not a minat yet
[59:49] you can't know for sure how I'll never be a minat he said I am something else a freak Paul how can you say such leave me

01:00:00] alone as Paul's abilities heighten more and more becomes clear to him for one the fan hold much more power than initially believed the Freeman people who exist in greater numbers than anyone
[01:00:14] had ever expected are the secret power on arus they are overlooked by most members of the Imperium and are considered to be primitive Savages Frank Herbert based several parts of their
[01:00:27] society and culture off of real life Arabic Traditions the Fran had come to the planet oracus thousands of years ago over the centuries that they have been on Dune only the fittest have survived
[01:00:41] their culture has adapted a way of life to survive and even thrive in the harsh conditions of the planet the Freeman are also known to be amazing Fighters Freeman Society is organized in into
[01:00:54] communities of people called CES leading each C is aab the Arabic word meaning Deputy or representative of authority who ascends to leadership upon defeating his predecessor in combat proving
[01:01:10] himself to be the strongest member of the tribe A notable characteristic of the Freeman is their blue in blue eyes the result of spice addiction the spice
[01:01:22] is everywhere on arus all Fen develop blue and blue eyes well before they reach adulthood now in the desert Plains of oracus exposed to more spice than
[01:01:35] ever before Paul's awareness expands dramatically his vision is clearer than anyone before him if you are not the quizat hadak
[01:01:47] Jessica said what you couldn't possibly know he said you won't believe it until till you see it and he thought I'm a seed he suddenly saw how fertile was the
[01:02:01] ground into which he had fallen and with this realization the terrible purpose filled him creeping through the empty space within threatening to choke him with grief he had seen two main
[01:02:15] branchings along the way ahead in one he confronted an old evil baren and said hello Grand father the thought of that path and what lay along it sickened him
[01:02:29] the other path held long patches of gray obscurity except for peaks of violence he had seen a warrior religion there a fire spreading across the universe with
[01:02:42] the atra green and black Banner waving at the head of fanatic Legions drunk on spice liquor gurnie HCK and a few other of his father's men a pitiful f were
[01:02:54] among them all marked by the hawk symbol from the shrine of his father's skull I can't go that way he muttered that's what the old witches of your school really want I don't understand
[01:03:08] you Paul his mother said he remained silent thinking like the seed he was thinking with the race Consciousness he had first experienced as terrible purpose he found that he no longer could
[01:03:22] hate the benzar or the Emperor or even the har conans they were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance to cross and mingle and Infuse their bloodlines in a
[01:03:37] great new pooling of genes and the race knew only one sure way for this the ancient way the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path
[01:03:51] Jihad surely I cannot choose that way he thought but he saw again in his Mind's Eye the shrine of his father's skull and the violence with the green and black
[01:04:03] Banner waving in its midst Jessica cleared her throat worried by his silence then the fan will give a sanctuary he looked up staring across
[01:04:16] the green lighted tint at the inbred Patrician inlines of her face yes he said that's one of the ways he nodded yes they'll call me
[01:04:29] muad the one who points the way yes that's what they'll call me and he closed his eyes thinking now my father I can mourn you and he felt the tears coarsing down his
[01:04:45] cheeks book one of the first novel ends here with the revelations that the baron har Conan is actually the maternal grandfather of Paul PA the lady Jessica's own father though this information is not known to her or the
[01:04:59] baren and also that they will find Sanctuary amongst the desert people the Freeman Paul also senses a terrible purpose a great jod of violence that
[01:05:11] will spread a religious war in his name after managing to survive in the desert for a while on their own Paul and Jessica eventually do encounter the Freeman the naive of this tribe sgar
[01:05:26] after viewing the fighting prowess of Jessica her weirding way the special martial arts of the Ben jeser he agrees to allow Jessica and Paul to enter the tribe under the condition that they will
[01:05:39] teach them the weirding way Jessica must play a very delicate game using her knowledge of the sisterhood's mishara protectiva she will manipulate the fan
[01:05:51] people in order to preserve house TR the superstitions maintained by the Freeman detailed the coming of a preent son of aini chz who would lead them to
[01:06:03] Freedom this figure is referred to as the leis son Al gim in fan myth and this is the son that will become the Mii the Arabic word meaning the guided one of
[01:06:16] the fan and lead them to Freedom long have the fan people been spat upon and oppressed by the Imperium and a myth such as this was highly appealing to them thus from the moment Paul and
[01:06:30] Jessica arrived on arus the Freeman had believed that their prophecies were being fulfilled the fact that the Mii Legend specifically had been planted on Dune
[01:06:42] indicates to Jessica that conditions on Dune are truly horrible the M Legend she knew was reserved for only the harshest environments where the B Des would need
[01:06:54] significant advantages over indigenous influences over the course of the next 2 years Paul would amass more and more power respect and influence amongst the fan people to the fan Paul is a
[01:07:09] spiritual and religious leader his fighting prowess is also well known among the Freeman and he has trained a group of death Commandos called fedin The fedin Warriors were highly loyal to Paul and some of the
[01:07:23] deadliest soldiers in the known universe at this point the emperor shadom along with the baron haran and the rest of the Imperium assume that Paul and Jessica are dead during this time Paul has taken
[01:07:38] the fman woman Chi daughter of leat kindes as concubine they have a son together named leato for Paul's father Jessica has become sadena of the fan a
[01:07:51] rogue Reverend mother due to the the missiona protectiva many French cultures such as the fan have produced so-called wild reverent mothers who possess many of the skills of the bzar Reverend
[01:08:05] mothers but without official training Jessica encounters one of them during the splice Agony she absorbs the dying Reverend mother's Consciousness and unblocks her own genetic memory by
[01:08:20] converting the deadly truthsayer drug The Watcher of life but the cost was greater than she understood Jessica since before the haran attack had been carrying the
[01:08:33] daughter of Duke leato atraes Aaliyah and when Jessica underwent the spice Agony unblocking her genetic memory Aaliyah's genetic memory is unlocked as
[01:08:46] well and in that instant she becomes a reverend mother too Aaliyah is her mother mother and her grandmother and her grandfather the full maternal
[01:08:59] genetic bloodline in one mind the Ben jzr consider a child such as this to be Abomination you should have told us you were pregnant Jessica found the voice
[01:09:13] that talked within the mutual awareness why this changes both of you holy mother what have we done Jessica sensed a forced shift in the mutual awareness saw
[01:09:28] another moat presence within the inward eye the other moat darted wildly here there circling it radiated pure Terror you'll have to be strong the old
[01:09:40] Reverend mother's image pressed said be thankful it is a daughter you carry this would have killed a male fetus Aaliyah you see was pre-born the shock and Trauma that this
[01:09:55] brought onto the unborn child was catastrophic what happens when a person does not have the time to establish their own personality the weight of the egos stretching back through the genetic
[01:10:09] history becomes unbearable eventually the ego memories of the person's ancestors could assert themselves and eventually govern the person's Behavior
[01:10:22] possession alias strangeness is frightening to the fan she is a child but not a child they do not understand her there is yet misunderstanding because of Aliyah's
[01:10:37] strangeness the women are fearful because a child little more than an infant talks of things that only adults should know they do not understand the
[01:10:48] change in the womb that made Aaliyah different likely the most crucial aspect of the first dune book is Paul's terrible
[01:11:01] purpose it is his awareness that his actions on arachis will lead to Jihad essentially a holy war this would be a
[01:11:13] holy war in his name the Freeman would Gallop across the known universe and in their fanatic assuredness they would lay waste to all non-believers spreading death across the Galaxy Paul throughout
[01:11:29] this book makes attempts to avoid this future and yet no matter what path he looked into it seemed that victory for house at trodes would come at the cost
[01:11:39] of countless lives a longlasting brutal War paulit Tres is tormented by this knowledge and the weight of it so Much Death In His name during the time with
[01:11:54] the freman Paul encounters the now dead leet K Imperial planetologist who was in all but name one of the fan Paul learns of the fan plans to terraform the planet
[01:12:08] Dune into an Eden full of life Guided by K after KES is murdered by the har conans it is Paul who begins to replace him as the spiritual and military leader of the Freeman the final test in Paul
[01:12:23] becoming a fan is for him to mount a sand worm the worm riding ritual is a Coming of Age ritual among the fman people and in that moment his vision is
[01:12:35] blocked he has not seen this moment in his prience and therefore he does not know the outcome it came from the southeast a distant hissing a sand
[01:12:50] whisper presently he saw the far away outline of the creature's track against the dawnlight and realized he had never before seen a maker this large never
[01:13:04] heard of one this size it appeared to be more than half a league long and the rise of the sand wave at its cresting head was like the approach of a mountain
[01:13:16] this is nothing I have seen by Vision or in life Paul cautioned himself he hurried across the path of the thing to take his stand caught up entirely by the
[01:13:28] rushing needs of the moment Paul of course survives this test and mounts his first Worm but the young men of the tribe are not content they clearly see Paul as the strongest member of the
[01:13:42] tribe and wonder why he has not called out sgar yet who has grown close to Paul the idea of replacement or recycling is important important to the fan water is
[01:13:55] scarce on oracus so the fan used the water from the dead corpses to replenish their Wells even in light of this Paul has no wish to kill sgar later the fan discover a spice
[01:14:10] smuggling operation taking place in their territory Paul realizes that the operation is being led by none other than gurny HCK former Master of Arms to house at trodes he survived the har
[01:14:23] Conan raid Paul reveals himself to gurnie who confirms to Paul that he is still his Duke and he remains loyal to him after leading gurnie and his Smuggler men into a fan Cavern several
[01:14:38] of the so-called Smugglers reveal themselves to be Sardar soldiers in Disguise they attack but the fan kill all but a few of them Paul allow a few to escape so that they can report back to house har Conan of the fighting power
[01:14:53] of the Freeman the baron har Conan in the time since the raid on House of Tres has regained the fom of arus he has manipulated aging Menat thuir howt into
[01:15:07] serving him the baron who resides on gidi Prime has placed his cruel nephew the beast raban in charge of the people on the planet Dune fade rtha who the
[01:15:19] baron intends to preedee him has grown impatient and want the baron dead in one instance while a slave boy the baron is almost killed by a poison needle that was implanted into the boy's thigh the
[01:15:33] baron knows that fade is to blame it doesn't take the baron much time to find and kill without hesitation fade Roth's spies among his own guard meeting with fade the baron attempts to explain to
[01:15:47] fade the Folly of his actions stating that fade will eventually secede him as baren and that that day may be soon the baron also assigns thuir to watch over fade from this point on for
[01:16:01] now fade decides not to make another attempt on The Baron's life eventually the fan attempt to force Paul to call out sgar but he refuses Paul
[01:16:13] acknowledges who he was to the Freeman a religious leader muadi his role as Messiah could not be compared to sar's non-mystical role at this point in time
[01:16:26] the baron who rested his hopes on fade rraa had stopped sending resources to Rabon in the form of supplies and reinforcements this made Rabon very vulnerable it will then be easier for the fan people to take control of
[01:16:41] arachis from the har conans and they are ready to fight they are willing to die for their Liberation gurny helik upon seeing the lady Jessica quickly attacks her still
[01:16:54] under the belief that she was the traitor to house at trades he threatens to kill her while he holds the knife to her throat Paul however convinces gurnie that Jessica was not the traitor but
[01:17:07] that it was instead the doctor yui who betrayed house at trodes gurnie becomes overwhelmed with shame and asked to be killed but Paul refuses in the religious
[01:17:20] mythology of the real world messiah's are almost always peaceful figures Jesus would be the most famous and obvious example he was a peaceful figure and his name has been used to commit violence
[01:17:34] but the world of fiction is an utterly distinct animal in fiction The Chosen hero guides the people he has chosen to Triumph often through violent means Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings daer
[01:17:48] from A Song of Ice and Fire Paul represents an extremely well known Trope in fiction the hero that is Victorious through violence what makes Paul different is that he acknowledges and is
[01:18:01] fully aware of the horror of this and of the potential consequences but Paul was not the quizat hadak yet he had realized something during gurn's attempt on his mother's life he had not foreseen it in
[01:18:16] any Vision his body had slowly acquired a certain spice tolerance that made made preent Visions fewer and fewer dimmer and dimmer the solution appeared obvious
[01:18:29] to him I will drown the maker we will see now whether I am the quizat hadak who can survive the test that the Reverend mothers have survived Paul decides to take the deadly
[01:18:43] watch of Life the truthsayer drug which no male has ever survived and it came to pass in the third year of of the Desert War that Paul muad lay alone in the cave of birds
[01:18:59] beneath the kis swwa hangings of an inner cell and he lay as one dead caught up in the revelation of the Water of Life his being translated beyond the boundaries of time by the poison that
[01:19:12] gives life thus was the prophecy made that the Le son alib might be both dead and alive after 3 weeks in a coma Hall
[01:19:25] emerges as the quizat hatak he looks into space and sees that the emperor and the har conans have amassed a huge Armada to invade the planet to regain the control that Rabon has lost sometime
[01:19:39] later the cat where Aliyah and leato II reside is attacked and the Sardar soldiers kill leato and take Aaliyah prisoner Aaliyah is then brought to the capital city of arachis arim
[01:19:53] by the emperor shadam himself it is here that the story comes to its climax my dear Baron the emperor said become acquainted with the sister of mu Adib
[01:20:07] the sister the baron shifted his attention to the emperor I do not understand I too sometimes air on the side of caution the emperor said it has been reported to me that your unhabited
[01:20:21] South polar region exhibit evidence of human activity but that's impossible the baron protested the worms there's sand clear
[01:20:33] to the these people seem to be able to avoid the worms the emperor said the child sat down on the deis beside the throne dangled her feet over the edge kicking them there was such an air of
[01:20:47] shess in the way she appraised her surroundings the baren stared at the kicking feet the way they moved the black robe the wink of sandals beneath the fabric unfortunately the emperor
[01:21:00] said I only sent in five troop carriers with a light Attack Force to pick up prisoners for questioning we barely got away with three prisoners and one carrier mind you Baron my Sardar were
[01:21:14] almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women children and old men this child here was in command of one of the attacking groups you see your
[01:21:26] majesty the baron said you see how they are I allowed myself to be captured the child said I did not want to face my brother and have to tell him that his
[01:21:37] son had been killed only a handful of our men Got Away the emperor said got away you hear that we'd had them too the child said except for the Flames my
[01:21:51] Sardar used the attitudinal Jets on their carriers as flamethrowers the emperor said a move of desperation and the only thing that got them away with their three prisoners Mark that my dear
[01:22:04] Baron Sardar forced to retreat in confusion from women and children and old men we must attack them in force the barren rasp We Must Destroy every last vestage of Silence the emperor roared he
[01:22:19] pushed himself forward on his throne do not abuse my intelligence any longer you stand there in your foolish innocence and Majesty the truth Sayer said he
[01:22:31] waved her to silence you say you don't know about the activity we found nor the fighting qualities of these superb people the emperor lifted himself half off his throne what do you take me for
[01:22:46] Baron the baron took two backward steps thinking it was Rabon he has done this to me Rabon has and this fake dispute with Duke leato the emperor purred
[01:22:59] sinking back into his throne how beautifully you maneuvered it Majesty the baron pleaded what are you silence the old Ben jzer put a hand on the emperor's shoulder leaned close to
[01:23:13] whisper in his ear the child Seated on the Das stopped kicking her feet and said make him afraid Sor shadam I shouldn't enjoy this but I find the pleasure impossible to suppress quiet
[01:23:27] child the emperor said he leaned forward put a hand on her head stared at the baron is it possible Baron could you be as simple-minded as my truth say suggest
[01:23:40] do you not recognize this child daughter of your ally Duke leato my father was never his ally the child said my father is dead and this old har Conan Beast has
[01:23:54] never seen me before the baron was reduced to stupified glaring when he found his voice it was only to rasp who
[01:24:06] I am aiyah daughter of the Duke leato and the lady Jessica sister of Duke Paul muad the child said she pushed herself off the Das dropped to the floor of the
[01:24:19] audience chamber my brother has promised to have have your head a top this battle standard and I think he shall be hush child the emperor said and he sank back
[01:24:31] into his throne hand to Chin studying the baren I do not take the emperor's orders Aaliyah said she turned looked up at the old Reverend mother she knows the
[01:24:44] emperor glanced up at his truthsayer what does she mean this child is an abomination you Babble old woman aiyah said you don't know how it was yet you
[01:24:57] rattle on like a per blind fool Aaliyah closed her eyes took a deep breath and held it the old Reverend mother groaned and staggered Aaliyah opened her eyes
[01:25:09] that is how it was she said a cosmic accident and you played your part in it the Reverend mother held out both hands Palms pushed the air toward Aaliyah what
[01:25:22] is happening here the emperor demanded child can you truly project your thoughts into the mind of another that is not how it is at all Ayah said unless
[01:25:34] I am born as you I cannot think as you kill her the old woman muttered and clutched the back of the throne for support kill her the sunken old eyes
[01:25:47] glared at Aaliyah silence the emperor said and he studied Ayah child can you communicate with your brother my brother knows I'm here Aaliyah said can you tell
[01:26:00] him to surrender as the price of your life Aaliyah smiled up at him with clear innocence I shall not do that she said the baron stumbled forward to stand
[01:26:11] beside Aaliyah Majesty he pleaded I knew nothing of interrupt me once more Baron the emperor said and you will lose the powers of inter Interruption forever he
[01:26:24] kept his attention focused on Aaliyah studying her through slitted Lids you will not a can you read my mind what I'll do if you disobey me I've already
[01:26:37] said I cannot read minds she said but one does not need telepathy to read your intentions the emperor scowled child your cause is hopeless I have but to Rally my forces and reduce this planet
[01:26:52] to it is not that simple Aaliyah said she looked at the two guildsmen ask them it's not wise to go against my desires the emperor said you should not deny me
[01:27:05] the least thing my brother comes now Aliyah said even an emperor May tremble before muad for he has the strength of righteousness and Heaven Smiles upon him
[01:27:19] the emperor surged to his feet this play has gone far enough I will take your brother and this planet and grind them too the room crumbled and shook around them there came a sudden Cascade of sand
[01:27:32] behind the throne where the hutment was coupled to the emperor's ship the abrupt flickering tightening of skin pressure told of a wide area Shield being activated I told you aiyah said my
[01:27:45] brother comes it is at this moment under cover of a giant Sandstorm Paul and his army of fan Warriors attacked the capital city riding on the backs of dozens of giant sand worms they destroy

[01:31:26] screamed silence him silence him yourself Jessica said Paul glared at the old woman for your part in this I could gladly have you strangled he said you
[01:31:39] couldn't prevent it he snapped as she stiffened in Rage but I think it better punishment that you live out your years never able to touch me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires
[01:31:53] Jessica what have you done the old woman demanded I'll give you only one thing Paul said you saw part of what the race needs but how poorly you saw it you
[01:32:06] think to control breeding and intermix a select few according to your master plan how little you understand of what you mustn't speak of these things the old woman hissed Silence Paul roared the
[01:32:20] word seemed to take substance as it twisted through the air between them under Paul's control the old woman reeled back into the arms of those behind her face blank with shock at the power with which he had seized her
[01:32:34] psyche Jessica she whispered Jessica I remember your gum Jabar Paul said you remember mine I can kill you with a word the fan around the ball
[01:32:49] glanced knowingly at each other did the legend not say and his word shall carry death Eternal to those who stand against righteousness it is here that fade rraa
[01:33:02] har Conan comes forth if Paul had been born a girl as The Sisterhood intended he would have likely married fade rala but instead they cannot coexist fade
[01:33:14] challenges Paul to a duel fade cheats but still Falls to Paul muad nonetheless the Emperor's Last Hope is that fin ring also a product of the Ben Jes breeding
[01:33:27] plan who is almost a quizat hadak himself would slay Paul but fin ring refuses feeling a special connection with Paul the emperor is out of options Paul ascends the throne and is allowed
[01:33:42] to marry the emperor's daughter the princess iron he ensures Chie that the marriage is strictly political and that he will remain loyal to her book one in
[01:33:54] the dun Saga ends here with Paul's Ascension to emperor of the Imperium by the end of the first book in the Dune Saga Paul does not know how he will avoid the Jihad and neither does the
[01:34:07] reader Paul's future plans are hinted at in this specific quote at the end of the novel they sense that I must take the throne but they cannot know I do it to prevent the Jihad each chapter in Dune begins with
[01:34:21] the quote mini by the princess iron the odd thing is based on the way the quotes are written especially irons it is ambiguous as to whether Paul
[01:34:35] eventually brought peace to the Galaxy or whether his femen became the very face of death itself in the end the fate of the fan
[01:34:47] and the Empire is left open until till the next book that is the action in Dune reaches a cresendo towards the end of the novel The Novel has a sudden and
[01:35:02] relatively anticlimactic ending many Avenues remain unexplored Paul rising to ruler of the Imperium alongside the fman acquiring full control of arus by the end of the
[01:35:16] book shows how quickly the status quo can change after significant events occur earlier in the novel house sat trades is nearly destroyed by the work of the emperor and the baron but now
[01:35:30] Paul is not simply Duke of araus he is Mii of the fan and ruler of the Imperium in the eyes of the fan people oracus will soon be a paradise as the Legends
[01:35:44] foretold but how will changing oracus change the fan themselves what aspects of their culture will wither with the desert Dune is possibly the most
[01:35:56] influential sci-fi novel of all time it combines sci-fi and fantasy with the multi-layered interactions of important social issues concerning human social interaction religion and genetic
[01:36:12] development Dune is widely considered to be far ahead of its time in pointing out the importance of preserving the Ecology of a planet the con conservation of resources and by addressing the complexities of religion dun explored a
[01:36:26] topic that surprisingly was rarely addressed in science fiction [Music] prior dun's portrayal of the downfall of the Galactic Empire has been compared to
[01:36:40] Edward Gibbon's Decline and fall of the Roman Empire Lorenzo damaso outlined similarities between the two Works highlighting the excesses of Emperor shadam and the baron
[01:36:54] haran the emperor loses his Effectiveness as a ruler from excess of ceremony and pompousness D Tomaso points out that the baron is similarly materially indulgent corrupt and
[01:37:08] sexually decadent Gibbon's Decline and fall blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity complacency weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to
[01:37:20] attack similarly the emperor Sardar Fighters are no match for the Freeman of oracus because of their own overconfidence and the Freeman willingness to sacrifice their own individual bodies for the good of the
[01:37:35] tribe to the Freeman the community always comes before the individual in contrast to the humans of the lad who live decadent lives at the cost of the rest of humanity Dune has before been criticized
[01:37:47] for presenting a sexist portrayal of women this couldn't be further from the truth Paul's approach to power required his upbringing under the female oriented Ben jeser without his mother's training
[01:38:01] he would have never become the quizat hatak though The Sisterhood claims that they only exist to serve they secretly operate as a long dominating Shadow government behind all of the great
[01:38:13] houses and their marriages or divisions the Dune Universe only appears to be patriarchal at first glance throughout the novel as Paul becomes more and more powerful more alien to the reader
[01:38:27] Jessica remains human mentoring Paul at crucial moments Frank Herbert did six years of research before he began writing Dune he spent a year and a half writing the
[01:38:39] first novel he conceived of a long novel what became a Trilogy was initially one book about the Messianic convulsions that periodically overtake mankind kind
[01:38:52] demagogues Fanatics con game artists the innocent and the not so innocent bystanders all were to have a part in this drama this grows from my theory
[01:39:05] that superheroes are disastrous for humankind even if we find a real hero whatever or whoever that may be eventually fallible Mortals take over the power structure that always comes
[01:39:20] into being around such a leader Frank Herbert doomed Genesis Frank Herbert understood that during difficult times people become perfectly willing to give over their agency all decisionmaking
[01:39:35] capacity to any leader who can quote wrap himself in the myth fabric of society Hitler Churchill Franklin Roosevelt and Stalin are among the examples Frank Herbert names Frank
[01:39:50] Herbert points out out that although these figures often have larger than life appearances each possesses human faults this is a major theme of the Dune
[01:40:02] Saga never give your critical faculties away to people in power regardless of how admirable these people may seem to be the novel Dune understands that power attracts the corruptible people who want
[01:40:17] power for the sake of it Frank Herbert suggest that a certain proportion of such people are imbalanced or perhaps even insane Frank Herbert believed that
[01:40:29] Humanity must continue to evolve or it would die I now believe that Evolution or de Evolution never ends short of death that no Society has ever achieved
[01:40:42] an absolute Pinnacle that all humans are not created equal in fact I believe attempts to create some abstract Equalization create a morus of injustices that rebound on the
[01:40:57] equalizers Equal justice and equal opportunity are ideals we should seek but we should recognize that humans administer the ideals and that humans do not have equal
[01:41:11] ability this quote may be off-putting to some but all it is saying is that yes some humans are smarter than others some have greater physical prowess regardless of this we should embrace these
[01:41:25] differences while still providing Equal justice and protection under the law and not pretend that all humans are the same in the next part of this series we will explore the second novel in Frank
[01:41:38] Herbert's original Doom series Doom Messiah which details the consequences of Paul's Ascension to ruler of the universe for more Dune check out the videos in the Dune playlist on my
[01:41:53] Channel I wrote The Dune series because I had this idea that charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on the forehead may be dangerous to your health one of the most dangerous presidents
[01:42:08] that we've had in this century was Jack Kennedy because people said yes sir Mr charismatic leader what will we do next and we wound up in Vietnam and I think probably the most valuable president of
[01:42:22] this century was Richard Nixon because he taught us to distrust government and he did it by example well anyway I wanted to do this thing about Messiahs and
[01:42:33] charismatic leaders I mean why do 900 people go to Guyana and drink poison Kool-Aid why do the citizens of an entire nation most of the citizens
[01:42:45] anyway say seile and murder some three million Jews and gypsies why do they not question their
[01:42:55] [Music] leaders [Applause]
[01:43:34] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
[01:44:00] such a rich store of myths infold Paul muad the Menat Emperor and his sister Aaliyah it is difficult to see the real
[01:44:11] persons Behind These veils but there were after all a man born Paul at trodes and a woman born Aaliyah their flesh was subject to space
[01:44:24] and time and even though their oracular powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space they came from Human stock they experienced real events
[01:44:37] which left real traces upon a real Universe to understand them it must be seen that their catastrophe was the catastrophe of all
[01:44:48] mankind this work is dedicated then not to muad or his sister but to their heirs all of us all of the books following the first one deal with the results of Paul's
[01:45:06] influence on the Galaxy Dune Messiah Children of Dune and God emperor of Dune especially at the start of Messiah we are immediately faced with the problem surrounding Paul's rule of the Imperium Dune mesiah opens with a
[01:45:21] recorded interrogation between a fan priest and a historian named bronzo who has been labeled a heretic and sentenced to death for his accurate writings on Emperor Paul madim 12 years have passed since the
[01:45:35] events of Dune at this point Paul atraes rules from oracus as emperor of the Imperium even though Paul is the most powerful emperor of all time he is still unable to control the deadly religion
[01:45:49] that has formed in his name the Jihad has been Unleashed and it has conquered most of the known universe 61 billion people have died so far due to Paul's decision to become the Messiah of the
[01:46:02] fman people but according to Paul's Vision this is nowhere close to the worst possible outcome for Humanity it is in Dune Messiah that Paul Begins the golden path a plan of
[01:46:17] unmatched complexity to set Humanity on a path that won't lead to our eventual Extinction in the future Paul has to maintain a balance between his golden path his duty as the ruler of the
[01:46:30] Imperium and his role as the central figure in the freman religion as Paul maintains this balance other powers of the universe have moved to threaten his position as Emperor several forces are at work and conspire together to undo
[01:46:44] Paul trodes and reverse the events that led to his Ascension to the throne these these forces include the B jeser Sisterhood who are vexed that they have lost control of their quizat hadak the
[01:46:58] remnants of the displaced house clarino the former occupants of the throne the spacing Guild who are now under Paul's control due to his control over the spice and the many Tac who have their
[01:47:11] own agenda the TAC Sue have sent the face dancer Sky tale as their representative despite the murderous nature of the plot he hoped to devise the thoughts of Sky Tale the tacu face
[01:47:25] dancer returned again and again to ruthful compassion I shall regret causing death and misery to muad he told himself he kept this benignity carefully hidden from his fellow conspirators such
[01:47:40] feelings told him though that he found it easier to identify with the victim than with the attackers a thing characteristic of tle laku Sky stood in in bamu silence somewhat apart from the
[01:47:52] others the argument about psychic poison had been going on for some time now it was energetic and vehement but polite that blindly compulsive way that adepts of the Great Schools always adopted for matters close to their Dogma when you
[01:48:07] think you have him skewered right then you find him unwounded that was the old Reverend mother of the B jzr Gas Helen mam their host is here on wallet 9 she was a black robed stick figure a witch
[01:48:22] Crone seated in a floater chair at Sky Tail's left her Abba Hood had been thrown back to expose a leathery face beneath silver hair deeply pocketed eyes stared out of skull mask features they
[01:48:35] were using Aira basa language hon Fang consonants and joined vowels it was an instrument for conveying fine emotional subtleties edric The Guild steersman replied to the Reverend mother now with
[01:48:48] a vocal courtsy contained in a sneer a lovely Touch of disdainful politeness Sky looked at the guild Envoy edric swam in a container of orange gas only a few Paces away his container sat in the
[01:49:03] center of the transparent dome which the Benny JZ had built for this meeting the guildsman was an elongated figure vaguely humanoid with thinn feet and hugely fan membran his hands a fish in a
[01:49:16] strange sea his Tank's Vin emitted a pale orange CL Cloud rich with the smell of the geriatric spice mange if we go on this way we'll die of stupidity that was the fourth person
[01:49:29] present a potential member of the conspiracy princess iron wife but not mate Sky tale reminded himself of their Mutual foe she stood at a corner of edric's tank a tall blonde Beauty
[01:49:44] splended in a robe of blue whale fur and matching hat gold buttons glittered at her ears years she carried herself with an aristocrat's Ur but something in the absorbed smoothness of her features
[01:49:56] betrayed the controls of her Ben JZ background the atraes dynasty has become less secure due to Paul not producing an air at first it is unclear why but it is later revealed that the princess iron
[01:50:11] has been secretly administering contraceptives to Paul's lover and concubine chni after meeting with the conspirators iron returns to the planet Dune as empress she demands a child from
[01:50:24] Paul the trades but he denies her as he always had Chi is aware that iron is involved in some kind of plot against Paul She suggests that Paul give iron the child she Desires in order to keep him out of danger iron would be less
[01:50:38] likely to betray Paul if she got what she wanted iron is the wife of Paul only in name their marriage was made only so that Paul could have a claim to the Imperial Throne iron Ino is the eldest
[01:50:51] daughter of shadam she received her education through the B jeserich she was conditioned to be a lady of refinement and elegance shadam IV very much expected iron to become Empress after
[01:51:04] his death the Ben jzd also saw potential in The Princess and gave her sufficient training so that they could exploit her at some point in the future were she to find herself in a position of power
[01:51:17] still despite expectation iron remained only an average Benz Adept though she still maintained loyalty to The Sisterhood iron desires to Bear the
[01:51:30] Royal heir herself and preserve the atraes bloodline for the Benz but Paul will not touch her though Paul is aware of iron preventing Chi from conceiving he allows it Paul has seen through his
[01:51:44] pressence that the birth of his child will bring about the death of his love he does not want ch CH to die but things change once CH eventually conceives having switched to an ancient fan fertility
[01:51:57] diet the Empire grows ever more unstable the spacing Guild is refusing to give over the location of the tupal Andante a sanctuary planet where defeated great houses can Retreat to iron suggest that
[01:52:12] they retaliate by cutting off the Guild's access to spice but her suggestion is almost unanimously shot down still however does not understand why Paul cannot use his preent power to
[01:52:24] locate Tuple Paul explains to him that prience is neither a gift nor power but a natural consequence you have certain powers sgar
[01:52:38] said can you not locate the antante despite the guild Powers Paul thought sgar couldn't just say you're preent can't you trace a path in the future that leads to Tuple Paul looked at the
[01:52:53] golden surface of the table always the same problem how could he Express the limits of the inexpressible should he speak of fragmentation the natural Destiny of all
[01:53:06] power how could someone who never experienced the spice change of pressence conceive an awareness containing no localized SpaceTime no Personal Image vector nor Associated
[01:53:20] sensory captives he looked at Aaliyah found her attention on iron Aaliyah sensed his movement glanced at him nodded toward iron ah yes any answer
[01:53:33] they gave would find its way into one of Iron's special reports to the B jeser they never gave up seeking an answer to their quizat hadak stillar though deserved an answer of some kind for that
[01:53:47] matter so did Iron the uninitiated tried to conceive of prience as obeying a natural law Paul said he steepled his hands in front of him but it' be just as correct to say
[01:54:02] it's Heaven speaking to us that being able to read the future is a harmonious Act of man's being in other words prediction is a natural consequence in
[01:54:14] the wave of the present it wears the guise of nature you see but such Powers cannot be used from an attitude that pre- states aims and purposes does a
[01:54:25] chip caught in the wave say where it's going there is no cause and effect in the Oracle cause becomes occasions of conveying convections and confluences places where the currents
[01:54:39] meet accepting pressence you feel your being with concepts of repugnant to intellect your intellectual Consciousness therefore rejects them in rejecting intellect becomes a part of
[01:54:52] the process and is subjugated you cannot do it stillar asked were I to seek tupile with prean Paul said speaking directly to iron this
[01:55:05] might hide tupile chaos iron protested it has no no consistency I did say it obeys no natural law Paul
[01:55:18] said ilon is irritated by the lack of preciseness in Paul's Vision sgar merely cannot comprehend how Paul's Godly Powers could be limited in such a way many people of the Imperium are
[01:55:33] seeking Constitution they desire limits on Paul's Imperial control Paul's priest corba suggests that Constitution could begin as a religious one but Paul rejects any idea of a constitution
[01:55:47] calling it tyranny according to iron many in the Imperium have grown nostalgic and they look back on the time in which her father shadam ruled as better days Paul is grateful for her
[01:56:01] Insight the conspiracy against Paul at trodes is a complicated one The Guild Navigator edric is able to Shield the conspiracy from Paul's prean due to a property of prean which causes oracles
[01:56:15] to interfere with each other's sight the spacing Guild has come to a racket and brought a gift for Paul a Goa of the Dead Duncan Idaho who was Paul's childhood teacher who died 14 years
[01:56:28] earlier on oracus in the novel Doom they have named this goola hate and also conditioned him as a mint knowing the love Paul felt for Duncan they hoped that the goal of being present would hinder Paul's ability to properly manage
[01:56:42] the Empire many in the Imperium including the fan also saw the benac and their creations as dirty if Paul accepted this goola this would weaken his already faltering position in the
[01:56:55] eyes of some fan it was Duncan Idaho it could not be Duncan Idaho yet it was captive memories absorbed in the womb during that moment of her mother's spice change identified

[02:01:37] stare that's how I am called my Lord hate the situation becomes even more complicated due to Paul's sister Aaliyah who is now maturing into a woman Aaliyah
[02:01:51] is exceptionally powerful with all the skills of a b JZ Reverend mother Aaliyah is irresistibly attracted to hate the Duncan idah hoola Aaliyah and hate investigate the appearance of a female
[02:02:04] corpse near the city Arin hate due to his computational abilities as a mtat realizes that the fact that no one has been reported as missing implies a TXU plot they realize
[02:02:17] that the dead woman has left been replaced by a face dancer sensing plans within plans Paul demands to see the Reverend mother gas Helen moam she fears that Paul will kill her due to her part in the conspiracy but instead she
[02:02:32] discovers that Paul wishes to bargain with her he offers to produce a child with iron through artificial insemination the Reverend mother is disgusted understanding that such an act would violate the butlerian Jihad and
[02:02:46] also she understands that no child born this way would be a candidate for the Golden Lion Throne still the Benny jzer are desperate to regain control of the atres genes though if they admitted to the existence of such a child it would
[02:03:01] jeopardize their own position within the Empire the Reverend mother decides that she must consult with The Sisterhood though Chie has conceived her pregnancy begins to experience problems
[02:03:13] due to the contraceptives in her system shaie immediately realizes that iron must be the culprit and would have killed her if not for Paul's intervention Paul has spent more and more time with the goola hate during
[02:03:27] this time he realizes that it may even be possible to restore the goa's original memories little does he know this is precisely the key to the TXU plot surrounding the goola haate in Dune
[02:03:40] Paul trained a group of extremely deadly and extremely loyal death Commandos known as the feda king in Dune Messiah oam one of Paul's former Commandos reveals evidence of a freman conspiracy
[02:03:53] against Paul many freman have grown disillusioned with the world that muad has made oam's daughter LNA comes to Paul and insists that her father has a message for him he asked for Paul to
[02:04:07] meet with him in secret Paul notices then that lyna is not actually lyna she is a TXU face dancer but Paul allows this to happen he has seen this in his
[02:04:19] preent oam gives Paul his cxu dwarf servant named Bas who has the ability to record faces names and details like a machine Paul accepts B reluctantly though he is disturbed because he has
[02:04:34] not seen the dwarf in any Vision beaz duri called you call me the dwarf stepped into the room from the courtyard an alert expression of worry on his face
[02:04:47] you have a new master beaz durri said she stared at Paul you may call him usul usul that's the base of the Piller B said translating how can USO be bass
[02:05:01] when I am the basest thing living he always speaks thus oam apologized I do not speak be said I operate a machine called language it creaks and groans but
[02:05:15] is mine own a toy La Su toy learned and alert Paul thought the Benny TX never threw away something this valuable he turned studied the dwarf round mange eyes returned his
[02:05:29] stare shortly after Paul accepts baz and sends him away with sgar a stone burner is set off in oam's home it destroys the area and blinds many people including
[02:05:42] Paul himself but to the surprise of everyone else especially the fan Paul does do not need eyes to see according to fman tradition the blind are abandoned in the desert but Paul's
[02:05:56] oracular powers are such that he can foresee in his Mind's Eye everything that happens as if he had eyes Paul shocks the Freeman who take this as more
[02:06:08] evidence of his divinity by following his Visions perfectly Paul can see even the most slight details around him this only makes him appear more Godlike to those around him further establishing
[02:06:22] his divinity in the minds of many but this is a curse becoming blind has forced Paul to never stray from his vision he is unable to change even the smallest part of his Destiny while
[02:06:36] maintaining his appearance as cited as the fan conspiracy comes to light it is learned that corba former feden Warrior who is now a high priest
[02:06:47] of Paul's church is an enemy as well as fman naives who are convinced of his innocence await in the hall Aaliyah receives a letter from the lady Jessica a few naives had come out to observe the treatment accorded of fellow
[02:07:03] Freeman they'd brought on the clamor exciting corba to protest his innocence Aaliyah moved her gaze across the fman faces trying to recapture memories of the original men the present blotted out
[02:07:17] the past they'd all be become hedonist Samplers of Pleasures most men couldn't even imagine their uneasy glances she saw strayed of to the doorway into the chamber where they would meet they were
[02:07:31] thinking of mu adib's blind sight a new manifestation of mysterious Powers by their law a blind man should be abandoned in the desert his water given up to shy halud but eyess mu Adib saw
[02:07:46] them they disliked buildings too and felt vulnerable in space built above the ground give them a proper cave cut from Rock then they could relax but not
[02:07:58] here not with this new mu Adib waiting inside as she turned to go down to the meeting she saw the letter where she'd left it on the table by the door the latest message from their mother despite
[02:08:12] the special reverence held for kaladan as the place of Paul's birth the lady Jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her Planet a stop on the hash no doubt my son is an epical figure of
[02:08:24] History she'd written but I cannot see this as an excuse for submitting to a Rabel Invasion Aaliyah touched the letter experienced an odd sensation of Mutual contact the paper had been in her
[02:08:38] mother's hands such an archaic device the letter but personal in a way that no recording could achieve written in the atraes battle tongue it represented an almost invulnerable privacy of
[02:08:52] communication thinking of her mother Afflicted Aaliyah with the usual inward blurring the spice change that it mixed the psyches of mother and daughter forced her at times to think of Paul as a son to whom she had given birth the
[02:09:06] capsule of complex Oneness could present her own father as a lover ghost shadows convered her mind people of possibility Aaliyah reviewed the letter as she walked down the ramp to the antichain
[02:09:18] where her guard Amazon's waited you produce a deadly Paradox Jessica had written government cannot be religious and self assertive at the same time religious experience needs a spontaneity
[02:09:33] which laws inevitably suppress and you cannot govern without laws your laws eventually must replace morality replace conscience replace even the religion by
[02:09:45] which you think to govern sacred ritual must spring from praise and holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality government on the other hand is a cultural organism particularly
[02:09:58] attracted to doubts questions and contentions I see the day coming when ceremony must take the place of faith and symbolism replaces morality corba who has now been brought
[02:10:12] to the gallery has denied the allegations against him claiming that he took no part in the conspiracy to take down Paul at trodes where is muadi he asked my brother has delegated me to reside as a
[02:10:26] reverend mother Aaliyah said hearing this the naives in the gallery began raising their voices in protest silence Aaliyah commanded in the abrupt quiet she said is it not F inlaw that a
[02:10:39] reverend mother Prides when life and death are at issue as the gravity of her statement penetrated Stillness came over the naives but Aaliyah marked angry stares across
[02:10:51] the rows of faces she named them in her mind for a discussion in Council horbor Rafi tasmin Sajid umu leg the names
[02:11:03] carried pieces of Dune in them Ambu tasmin sink Coral's Gap she turned her attention to corba observing her attention corba lifted his chin said I
[02:11:17] protest my innocence his tongue flickered between his teeth as he spoke not by word or deed have I been traitor to my fman vows I demand to confront my
[02:11:30] accuser a simple enough protest Aaliyah thought and she saw that it had produced a considerable effect on the naibs they knew corba he was one of them to become a naive he proved his fine
[02:11:45] courage and caution not brilliant Corb but reliable not one to lead a Gad perhaps but a good choice as Supply officer not a crusader but one who
[02:11:57] cherish the old fan virtues the tribe is Paramount oam's bitter words as Paul had recited them swept through Aaliyah's mind she scanned the gallery any of those men might see
[02:12:12] himself in corus's place some for good reason but an innocent na was asting dangerous as a guilty one here corba felt it too who accuses me he demanded I
[02:12:25] have a freman right to confront my accuser perhaps you accuse yourself aiyah said before he could mask it mystical Terror lay briefly on Cora's face it was there for anyone to read
[02:12:39] with her powers Aaliyah had but to accuse him herself saying she brought the evidence from the shadow region the alarm Al mythal our enemies have fan
[02:12:51] allies Alo press water traps have been destroyed canat blasted plantings poison and storage basins plundered and now they've stolen a worm from the desert
[02:13:03] taken it to another world the voice of this intrusion was known to all of them mu Paul came through the doorway from the hall pressed through the guard ranks and crossed to Aaliyah's side Johnny
[02:13:18] accompanying him remained on the sidelines my lord stillar said refusing to look at Paul's Face Paul aimed his empty sockets at the gallery then down
[02:13:28] to corba what corba no words of Praise muttering could be heard in the gallery it grew louder isolated words and phrases audible law for the blind fan
[02:13:42] way in the desert who breaks who says I am blind Paul demanded he faced the gallery you R thei I see you're wearing gold today and that blue shirt beneath
[02:13:56] it which still has dust on it from the streets you always were untidy rify made a warning gesture three fingers against evil Point those fingers at yourself
[02:14:08] Paul shouted we know where the evil is he turned back to corba there's guilt on your face corba not my guilt I'm may have associated with the guilty but no he broke off shot a frightened look at
[02:14:23] the gallery taking her cue from Paul Ayah Rose stepped down to the floor of the chamber Advanced to the edge of corbus table from a range of less than a meter she stared down at him silent and
[02:14:36] intimidating corbak carded under the burden of eyes he fidgeted shot anxious glances at the gallery whose eyes do you seek up there Paul asked you cannot not
[02:14:48] see corba blurted I don't need eyes to see you Paul said and he begin describing corba every movement every twitch every alarmed pleading look at
[02:15:00] the gallery corba mustered a pitiful air of pomposity to plead who accuses me oam accuses you Aaliyah said but oam's dead
[02:15:12] corber protested how did you know that Paul asked through your spy system oh yes we know about your spies and corers we know who brought the stone burner here from
[02:15:25] tarel it was for the defense of the quizat corber blurted is that how it got into your traitorous hands Paul asked it was stolen and we corber fell silent
[02:15:38] swallowed his gaze darted left and right everyone knows I have been the voice of love for Mu Adib he stared at the gallery How can a dead man accus a fan
[02:15:50] oam's voice isn't dead Aaliyah said she stopped as Paul touched her arm oam sent us his voice Paul said it gives the names the acts of treachery the meeing
[02:16:04] places and the times do you miss certain faces in the Council of Na's corba where are merker and fash K the lame isn't with us today and takum where is he
[02:16:18] Corva shook his head from side to side they fled oracus with the stolen worm Paul said even if I freed you now corba Shi halud would have your water for your
[02:16:30] part in this why don't I free you corba think of all those men whose eyes were taken the men who cannot see as I see they have families and friends
[02:16:43] corra where could you hide from them it wasn't an accident corba pleaded anyway they're getting to laku again he subsided who knows what bondage goes
[02:16:57] with metal eyes Paul asked the naives in their Gallery begin exchanging whispered comments speaking behind raised hands they gazed coldly at corba now corba
[02:17:10] demands to face his accuser but Paul says his accuser is oam they have his voice by way of baz the other freman conspirators have fled arakas with the worm they kidnapped corba insists that he be judged by
[02:17:24] freman law and stillar agrees because he plans to take care of corba himself later Aaliyah realizes that this was a plan between Paul and stillar to flush out the other traitors as hate the
[02:17:37] Duncan idah hoola interrogates the dwarf beaz later the TXU plot pans out hate had been implanted with a secret command even he was not aware of it is revealed
[02:17:50] that b ja was secretly a tacu Master with a hidden Purpose By use of an extremely specific humming intonation be jaw's implants conditioning that will force Duncan to kill Paul in the
[02:18:04] appropriate instance after this interrogation Duncan remembers none of this AIA has grown frustrated she wishes to see as her brother Paul sees she has
[02:18:17] consumed an enormous dose of spice in an attempt to induce spice trance hate finds her in this state she tells him that the Benny jzr are hoping to get their breeding program back in line by
[02:18:30] getting Paul's child or hers though she cannot see who the father of her child will be however hate realizes that she is likely overdosed on spice and he could not bear the thought of Aaliyah's
[02:18:43] death he wants to call for a doctor Aaliyah realizes in that moment that the goola loves her and the doctor is called to help with her overdose Aaliyah tells hate that she wishes she were not a part
[02:18:56] of Paul's story that she wants the ability to laugh and Love She also asked Duncan if he loves her and he admits that he does he tries to get her to sleep but she tells him about the plot
[02:19:09] against Paul and how bad it has become she drips off thinking of the child she will have one day and how that child will be pre-born just as she was as ch's time to give birth near Paul
[02:19:24] and chny journeyed to SI tour with a group of odd companions baz the telaku dwarf the Goa haate edric The Guild steersman Ambassador gas Helen moam the
[02:19:37] Benny JZ Reverend mother LNA oam strange daughter who Paul knew was secretly the TXU face dancer Sky tell jgar and his favorite wife Hera the princess iron
[02:19:52] Adelia Chie is confused as to why Paul has brought so many with them into the desert including enemies as chunning looks out into the desert near the SI where she will give birth hate insists that she must come inside to avoid the
[02:20:06] coming Sandstorm for some reason hate is gripped by the fear that chanani will die and that Paul will tell him so he does not yet understand that the Panic is due to his clayu conditioning which
[02:20:19] was activated earlier by the dwarf baz shaie dies giving birth once Paul receives the news the grief of his loss is too much to bear Paul stumbles and is truly blind now having removed himself
[02:20:33] from the prison of his own precise Vision Paul's reaction to ch's death finally triggers ha's compulsion and he attempts to kill Paul by stabbing him with a knife however the inner turmoil
[02:20:46] is so great that Duncan Idaho's goola body reacts against its own programming and recovers Duncan's full Consciousness he now remembers his previous life and is no longer bound to T laxu programming
[02:21:00] Paul discovers that CH has given birth to twins they are pre-born just as his sister Aaliyah was born into the world with access to ancestral memories thanks to the combinations of their genes and
[02:21:14] ch's consumption of spice while pregnant Paul is shocked that in no vision had he foreseen twins LNA who reveals herself to be the tacu fa dancer Sky tell offers
[02:21:27] to revive Chie as a goola in exchange for all of Paul's Chom company Holdings this was the TXU plot from the beginning to convince Paul that the memories of agola could be reawakened and to use
[02:21:40] this as leverage upon Chan's death I am Sky a laxu of the face dancers and I would know a thing before re bargain is
[02:21:52] that aola I see behind you or Duncan Idaho it's Duncan Idaho Paul said and I will not bargain with you I think you'll Baran Sky tell said Duncan Paul said
[02:22:07] speaking over his shoulder will you kill this TXU if I ask yes my Lord there was the suppressed Rage of a Berserker in Idaho's voice wait Ayah said you don't know what
[02:22:20] you're rejecting but I do know Paul said so it's truly Duncan Idaho of the atraes skel said we found the lever a Goa can
[02:22:33] regain his past Paul heard footsteps something brushed past him on the left Sky's voice came from behind him now what do you remember of your past Duncan everything
[02:22:47] from my childhood on I even remember you at the tank when they removed me from it Idaho said wonderful Sky breathed Wonderful Paul heard the voice moving I
[02:23:01] need a vision he thought Darkness frustrated him Benny JZ training warned him of terrifying Menace In skel yet the creature remained a voice a shadow of
[02:23:13] movement entirely Beyond him are these the atraes babies skel asked Hara Paul cried get her away from there stay where you are sky tael
[02:23:27] shouted all of you I warn you a face dancer can move faster than you suspect my knight can have both these lies before you touch me Paul felt someone touch his right arm then move to the
[02:23:40] right that's far enough Aaliyah Sky said Aaliyah Paul said don't it's my fault Aaliyah groaned my fault at trodes skel said shall we bargain now
[02:23:55] behind him Paul heard a single horse curse his throat constricted at the suppressed violence in Idaho's voice Idaho must not break Sky tael would kill the babies to strike a bargain one
[02:24:08] requires a thing to sell Sky said not so atraes will you have your chny back we can restore her to you a Goa a tradis a
[02:24:21] goola with full memory but we must hurry call your friends to bring a cryic tank to preserve the flesh to hear ch's Voice once more Paul thought to feel her

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
02:24:33] presence beside me Ah that's why they gave me Idaho a aola to let me discover how much the recreation is like the original but now full restoration
[02:24:47] at their price I'd be aaku tool forever more and CH chained to the same Fate by a threat to our children exposed once more to the quizer rat's plotting what pressures would you use to restore ch's
[02:25:02] memories to her Paul asked fighting to keep his voice calm would you condition her to kill one of her own children we use whatever pressures we
[02:25:14] need Sky said what say you at trades Aaliyah Paul said bargain with this thing I cannot bargain with what I cannot see A wise choice Sky gloated
[02:25:29] well Aaliyah what do you offer me as your brother's agent Paul lowered his head bringing himself to Stillness within Stillness he glimpsed something just then like a vision but not a vision
[02:25:43] it had been a knife close to him there give me a moment to think aiyah said my knife is patient skel said but Chan's flesh is not take a reasonable amount of
[02:25:57] time Paul felt himself blinking it could not be but it was he felt eyes their vantage point was odd they moved in an erratic way there the knife swam in his
[02:26:11] view with the breath stealing shock Paul recognized the viewpoint it was that of one of his children he was seeing skel's knife hand from within
[02:26:23] the crash it glittered only inches from him yes and he could see himself across the room as well Head Down Standing quietly a figure of no Menace ignored by
[02:26:37] the others in this room to begin you might assign us all your CH Holdings Sky suggest gested all of them Aaliyah protested
[02:26:55] all watching himself Through The Eyes in the crush Paul slipped his Chris knife from his belt sheath the movement produced a strange sensation of Duality he measured the distance the angle
[02:27:07] there'd be no second chance he prepared his body then in the B jzer way armed himself like a cocked spring for a single concentrated movement a Prana
[02:27:19] thing requiring all his muscles balanced in one Exquisite Unity the Chris knife leaped from his hand the Milky blur of it flashed into Sky Tail's right eye jerked the face dancer's head back Sky
[02:27:33] tail threw both hands up and staggered backwards against the wall his knife clattered off the ceiling to hit the floor Sky tail rebounded from the wall he fell face forward dead before he
[02:27:46] touched the floor The Reawakening of Duncan's memories confirms to Paul that it is indeed possible to restore chni as she once was still Paul
[02:27:58] refuses understanding that even if they were to bring chani back that kayaku would likely program the goola in some diabolical way as they did with Duncan though Paul is blind due to escaping his
[02:28:12] oracular trap he manages to kill skel with a dagger by tapping into the vision of his pre-born son Paul names The Boy Child leato for his father and the girl
[02:28:23] ganima meaning spoil of War beaz comes in and insists that the plan succeeded despite skel's death the TXU knew that Idaho thought of Paul as the son he never had so he would not kill him if he
[02:28:39] resurfaced he offers again to restore Chi and Paul is more tempted than before he orders Duncan to to kill beas to prevent this and Duncan does now that Paul is truly blind both
[02:28:53] prophetically and literally he chooses to embrace fan tradition he walks into the desert alone his children will now inherit his Empire until the children
[02:29:06] come of age Aaliyah will rule as Regent Duncan does not believe that Paul will perish in the desert but no one can say for sure Aaliyah is furious after the loss of
[02:29:19] Paul she has edric the guild Navigator executed for his part in the conspiracy the Reverend mother gas is also executed despite Paul's previous orders to spare her life Aaliyah is racked with grief
[02:29:34] calling her brother a fool for giving into this path she has had no more Vision since the death of CH ilon now insists that she loved Paul but never knew it iron has promised to renounce
[02:29:47] the Ben jeser and spend her life training Paul's children Aaliyah can sense Iron's sincerity Duncan realizes that now the bny jzr have no hold on any of The atra Heirs with iron on their
[02:30:01] side Aaliyah pleads with Duncan to love her and tells him that she loves him he does and agrees to follow her wherever she leads him Dune Messiah was not the novel that
[02:30:15] people expected after the Epic that was doomed Messiah is meant to illustrate that the life of muad was a tragic one Paul is no true savior any more than he is a deity he did what he believed he
[02:30:29] had to do but still ultimately just traded one brand of tyranny for another Paul insists in this novel that people prefer tyrants to kind rulers he argues that freedom results in chaos in Dune
[02:30:44] Messiah we observe a society where this idea has subsumed an Empire of billions and resulted in unimaginable Slaughter but this book is not just making the argument against the deification of human beings it is also a
[02:30:58] criticism of the system that conditions people in a way that makes it so that they can be manipulated by such human beings taking into account the Long View of History Paul can be blamed for some of the chaos and Slaughter that fell upon the universe but not the entirety
[02:31:11] of it there was in fact a structure that led to his rise a system the B Jes mishara protectiva their myth seeding their Legend making without myths and
[02:31:26] legends and religion the rise of Paul muad is something that could have never occurred he was a player in a game that started long before he was born the message of Dune messiah in a nutshell is
[02:31:41] when you mix religion and government terrible things can happen as a as a result Paul atraes was never a God and terrible things happen when you put your faith in charismatic leaders
[02:31:53] specifically ones of a religious nature Dune Messiah sets up Children of Dune ending with the birth of Paul's pre-born children leato II and ganima who will become the future rulers of the
[02:32:07] Imperium leato will continue the golden path that Paul abandoned he will maneuver fate and transcend time like Paul never
[02:32:17] [Music] [Music] could [Music] [Music]
[02:33:24] [Applause] [Music] mad's teachings have become the playground of Scholastics of the superstitious and the
[02:33:38] corrupt he taught a balanced way of life a philosophy by which a human can meet problems arising in from an everchanging Universe he said mankind is still evolving in a process which will never
[02:33:53] end he said this Evolution moves on changing principles which are known only to Eternity how can corrupted reasoning play with such an Essence Children of Dune takes place 9
[02:34:07] years after Dune messiah in this time the Empire is ruled by aiyah atres who maintains the Regency until Paul's Twins leato and Gema come of age Paul's twins are like no other children that have
[02:34:20] ever lived before in truth they are millions of years old a perfect combination of jeans and a mother's heavy consumption of spice LED these children to become pre-born forced into Consciousness with all the memories of
[02:34:35] their ancestors although Aaliyah was pre-born as the Twins were she does not share their experience the twins connections to their past lives seems to be more fluent Aaliyah avoided the intricacies over her
[02:34:49] inner world and therefore did not possess the mental linkages that the twins had for example they were able to speak fluently in many ancient languages where Aaliyah would only be able to catch a word or two Aaliyah now has
[02:35:03] undergone the spice trance and as the result the unimaginable has happened the very thing the Reverend mother gas Helen moam feared in book one that child is an Abomination her mother deserves a
[02:35:16] punishment greater than any in history death it cannot come too quickly for that child or the one who spawned her when a child is pre-born the weight of the ancestral memories is crushing If
[02:35:30] the child cannot form a sufficient ego a more dominant ego within the other memories would take possession of the person the Benny JZ call this Abomination these Abominations were feared and considered very dangerous by
[02:35:44] The Sisterhood anyone who was believed to be Abomination was immediately killed this is why the Reverend mother calls for Aaliyah's death in Dune why did you abandon Aaliyah ganima
[02:35:58] asked I fled in Terror of what I created Jessica said her voice low I gave up and my burden now is that perhaps I gave up too soon what do you mean I cannot
[02:36:13] explain yet but maybe no I will not give you false hopes gaffla the Abominable distraction has a long history in human mythology it was called many things but chiefly it was
[02:36:28] called possession that's what it seems to be you lose your way in the malignancy and it takes possession of you Aaliyah is possessed Abomination her
[02:36:41] mind infected with the evil presence of her grandfather the barren har Conan whose ego memory now seeks revenge against house atres he has poisoned Aaliyah psyche and there is seemingly no help for her the
[02:36:54] baren is a constant shadow in Aaliyah's mind watching through her eyes the twins have recognized this and only pity Aaliyah they worry though that they even May one day succumb to
[02:37:07] possession in the decades since Dune Messiah the planet oracus has changed drastically the ecological transformation has led to the point where there are now clouds in the skies of Dune it even rained on occasion
[02:37:21] instead of still suits many fan now took pills which shift at the body's temperature and reduced water loss why should they when rain had been recorded on this planet when clouds were
[02:37:35] seen when eight fren had been inundated and killed by a flash flood in a w until that event the word drowned had not existed in the language of Dune but this
[02:37:48] was no longer Dune this was racus thoughts of sgar as the planet has changed freman culture has eroded many freman have left the CES for The Villages and cities sgar
[02:38:04] has noticed this change and he has changed as well over time he has come to realized that Paul mu Adib was also flesh and blood not a messiah he is now much wiser than he was in the days
[02:38:17] before Paul walked into the desert yet still he Longs for what he refers to as cleaner values stillar Longs for a time when he could believe without question when he didn't have to consider the fact that the Jihad was killing Millions
[02:38:33] because he knew that it was the will of God and God had a plan now that sgar knows the truth he has become more like Paul more like God and he cannot unsee the horror that Paul always saw hence
[02:38:47] him longing for cleaner values he Longs for a simpler time when he was more naive about what was really going on Children of Dune opens at a very interesting time it is on this very day
[02:39:01] that the lady Jessica returns to oracus for the first time since the day she left for kaladan 20 years ago Aaliyah is anxious about Jessica's return she knows of Jessica's power as a Ben jeser Reverend mother and she fears that her
[02:39:15] mother will recognize the signs of abomination Jessica's return also shakes the balance of power on arus Jessica is the mother of mu Adib and would have huge sway over the fan it has also been
[02:39:29] rumored that lady Jessica has returned to the Benny JZ Sisterhood Aaliyah is extremely bitter towards The Sisterhood and her mother she blames them for the way that she is The Sisterhood had only been seeking
[02:39:43] to breed aizat hatak the male counterpart of a fully developed Reverend mother and more a human of superior sensitivity and awareness the quizat hadak who could be in many places
[02:39:58] simultaneously and the lady Jessica merely upon in that breeding program had the bad taste to fall in love with the breeding partner to whom she had been assigned responsive to her beloved
[02:40:10] Duke's wishes she produced a son instead of the daughter which The Sisterhood had had commanded as the first born leaving me to be born after she became addicted to the spice and now they don't want me
[02:40:24] now they fear me with good reason Aaliyah has come to realize that the ecological transformation which now grips the planet will ultimately result in the death of all the worms spice
[02:40:38] production would end the twins have realized this as well and the creature inside Aaliyah desperately desires this when Jessica returns to oracus her many jeser Powers immediately force her to become aware of many things she notices
[02:40:53] that many of the million or so that have gathered to witness the arrival of the mother of God are pilgrims these pilgrims have been arriving more and more in order to experience the planet of the Messiah Jessica also notices that
[02:41:07] both irelan and Aaliyah are utilizing forbidden Ben jeser techniques to prevent aging she refers to this as an affront many Reverend mothers could choose that course or try it the
[02:41:20] manipulation of internal chemistry was available to initiates of The Sisterhood but if one did it sooner or later all would try it there could be no concealing such an accumulation of ageless women they knew for certainty
[02:41:35] that this course would lead them to destruction short-lived Humanity would turn upon them no it was Unthinkable using this technique of a bny jzd could potentially live for thousands of years but The Sisterhood
[02:41:49] understood that the backlash from a universe which relied on spice to extend life would be too great and ultimately lead The Sisterhood to Annihilation this is why Jessica is disturbed by both iron and Aaliyah's use
[02:42:03] of this technique but Jessica noticed something far more terrible in Aaliyah the rumors were true horrible horrible Aaliyah had fallen into the Forbidden way the evidence was there for the initiate
[02:42:17] to read Abomination Jessica instantly recognizes the signs of possession in her daughter and knows from that moment on that her daughter is her enemy she wonders then
[02:42:30] if the twins too have succumb to Abomination recently on arus a mysterious blind man known as the preacher has appeared he speaks blasphemy against the church and also against the government
[02:42:44] many people people believe him to be Paul the traes himself Aaliyah and the twins view this as a possibility Aaliyah wishes to have the preacher arrested for heresy he raised both arms and roared in
[02:42:59] a voice which surely had commanded worm Riders silence the entire throng in the plaza went still at that battlecry the preacher pointed a thin hand toward the dancers and the illusion that he actually saw them was
[02:43:13] uncanny did do not hear this man blasphemers and idolators all of you the religion of mu Adib is not muad he spurns it as he spurns
[02:43:27] you sand will cover this place sand will cover you saying this he dropped his arms put a hand on his Young Guy's shoulder and commanded take me from this
[02:43:39] place far away on the planet salusa sandas wi CIA Corino the younger sister of iron plots treachery her plot involves assassinating the twins using laser Tigers large and Powerful cats who
[02:43:54] could be controlled From a Distance by a transmitter due to Servo stimulators implanted in their brains as Cubs laser Tigers were a special breed brought to the planet nearly 8,000 years ago they were created through genetic
[02:44:07] manipulation of original Tigers they have huge fangs wide faces and enlarged Paws their coats were an even colored tan perfect for blending against sand when cia's son faridan is not aware of
[02:44:21] his mother's plan when CIA wishes to steal the Imperial seat from House of trodes and make farad an emperor once Jessica is alone with the twins on oracus she can see that ganima
[02:44:34] is not possessed leato however she is not sure something about him disturbs her when she is alone with him he demonstrates his power to her throughout their conversation he manipulates her
[02:44:48] through voice and eventually breaks her Benny jeser conditioning abruptly she realized that the quickened breath the pounding heart were not latent not held at Bay by her
[02:45:00] Benny jeser control eyes widening in shocked awareness she felt her own flesh obeying other commands slowly she recovered her Poise but the realization remained this unch child had been
[02:45:15] playing her like a fine instrument throughout their interview now you know how profoundly you are conditioned by your precious B jits he said the realization that leato had been manipulating her through their
[02:45:29] conversation shatters Jessica's reality she is still however unsure about leato though she observes his power leato commands Jessica to allow herself to be abducted by Aaliyah's men leato is aware that prience is what destroyed his
[02:45:44] father he knows that within the spice trance lies even greater risk for himself leato has seen three possible Futures in one he must kill Jessica in order to prevent the loss of the spice
[02:45:57] Monopoly in the second he would marry his sister ganima for the sake of house atraes but the third Future Would permit him to live Millennia and require him to
[02:46:09] unify his father to remove Paul's godhood Al and Duncan's relationship has become strained in Children of Dune since her possession she has engaged in an affair with Javid the high priest of
[02:46:24] the quizat Duncan Idaho's Menat abilities kick in whilst Aaliyah is attempting to convince him to help her kidnap Jessica he realizes that Aaliyah has succumbed to possession he points out to Aaliyah that the simpler option
[02:46:38] would be to kill the lady Jessica and he notices the signs of an alien presence when she seems clearly pleased by the suggestion though she Stills the emotion quickly Duncan agrees to kidnap Jessica but insists that Aaliyah not know where
[02:46:53] he is taking her he tells her that this way she would be immune to the power of a truth saer he leaves her then and tears fall from his metal eyes Aaliyah is gone in secret the heretic preacher
[02:47:07] Journeys to the planet salusa sandis and meets farodin nephew to iron and future leader of house Kino the preacher promises farodin that he will have Duncan Idaho as his agent farodin finds
[02:47:21] the preacher strange and indecipherable at the halfway mark of Children of Dune Aaliyah's true intentions are revealed when she attempts to assassinate the lady Jessica in the open now look at her Jessica
[02:47:36] pointed at Ayah she laughs alone at night in contemplation of her own evil spice production will fall to nothing or at best a fraction of its former level and when word of that gets out we'll
[02:47:49] have a corner on the most priceless product in the universe Aaliyah shouted we'll have a corner on Hell Jessica raged and Aaliyah lapsed into the most ancient jacopa the atra's private
[02:48:01] language with its difficult gladle stops and clicks now you know mother did you think a granddaughter of Baron har Conan would not appreciate all of the lifetimes you crushed into my awareness
[02:48:15] before I was even born when I raged against what you done to me I had only asked myself what the baren would have done and he answered understand me at trades
[02:48:27] he answered me Jessica heard the Venom and the confirmation of her guess Abomination Aaliyah had been overwhelmed within possessed by that Kuwait of evil the baron Vladimir haran the baron
[02:48:42] himself spoke from her mouth now on uncaring of what was revealed he wanted her to see his revenge wanted her to know that he could not be cast out Jessica manages to escape from Ayah
[02:48:55] into the desert with the help of the feda king now that the mother of Paul lres has renounced Aaliyah the freemen are now in open Rebellion during these events the twins have also escaped into
[02:49:08] the desert in search of the preacher it is in the desert that they are attacked by the laser tiger who have been brought on the planet by wiim sashia Corino with the help of fan traitors the children defeat the Tigers
[02:49:23] but not easily and it is at this point that they began the next phase in their plan they split leato leaves going deeper into the desert to seek out the preacher ganima masked her own memory through a form of self-hypnosis she
[02:49:38] implants false memories of her brother's death truly believing it thus making her immune to the power power of a truthsayer ganima stilled herself for what she had to do leato must be dead in
[02:49:51] her mind she had to make herself believe it there could be no jaru in her mind no brother out there seeking a place lost in fman mythology from this point onward
[02:50:05] she could not think of leato as alive she must condition herself to act out of a total belief that her brother was dead killed him here by laser tigers not many humans could fool a truthsayer but she
[02:50:20] knew that she could do it might have to do it the multi lives she and leato shared had taught them the way when Jessica had first returned to arus captives were taken from the throng
[02:50:33] of people awaiting her when subjected to what gurnie H describes as the Deep drugs some of the captives spoke the name jaru and as they said the word they died
[02:50:46] it is assumed that they were conditioned for this reaction long before the days of house atraes on arus before leet Kines before the rule of shadam IV there were certain tribes that roam the desert
[02:51:00] known as water Hunters the freman called them uali water insects they would steal the water of freman they caught in the desert even the water of the body the seat they lived in was called jaru and
[02:51:14] it it was in jaru that the other fan tribes banded together to destroy the uali the place was considered taboo after that and from that day forth no
[02:51:25] Freeman had gone to jakar rutu its very location was lost the remaining IDU according to Legend were cast out from fan Society for most fan jakar rutu was
[02:51:40] considered a myth but leato has begun to have preent dreams of zaru and believes he can find the preacher there from the desert Jessica sends a message to sgar telling him that her daughter Aaliyah is
[02:51:54] indeed possessed whilst waiting for a response Duncan Idaho arrives having been sent by sgar Jessica allows Duncan to abduct her she tells him that Aliyah is no longer a trades she has succumbed
[02:52:07] to the ego of another he is bound to the atraes not Aaliyah the acceptance of this makes Duncan Idaho sad he tells her that he is taking her to salusa sandis on behalf of the preacher who for some reason has asked that she train farad

[02:52:35] the atres twins he is however Unsure how to deal with this information or how to feel about the situation by the time Jessica and Duncan arrive on salusa sandas the word of leato II's death has spread word is also spread that Aaliyah has agreed to allow herself to be tested
[02:52:50] in the fman trial of possession which would determine the truth of the matter and end in Aaliyah's death if the accusation proved valid Aaliyah has agreed to this in an effort to calm the Civil War which is now broken out between the once United femen of the
[02:53:03] desert the Imperial fan and the desert fan are now at odds farodin does not understand the purpose of this trial by possession in fact many do not it is an obscure fan thing Jessica tell tells fadin that she has come to this planet at the suggestion of The Sisterhood to
[02:53:18] oversee his education she tells him that in order to teach him properly she would need to be given free reign of the planet saloa Duncan's mtap Powers kick in and he finds himself coming to a realization he explains to Jessica that
[02:53:32] they have been tricked he has realized that faran is expected to get rid of both he and the lady Jessica plans within plans this would cause a conflict out in the open between House of tradies the now Imperial house in house Kino the
[02:53:45] former Imperial house this would allow the B JZ Sisterhood to act as a mediator and arbitrate a marriage between faridan and ganima this way The Sisterhood would finally have control over aizat hadak The Sisterhood had not given Jessica the
[02:53:59] full truth they had lied to her she had betrayed them before Jessica convinces fadan to accept her offer to be his teacher she tells him that she will train him in the ways of the Ben jzr as
[02:54:12] she trained her son Paul of trodes more than 20 years ago later when Duncan speaks to Jessica he renounces House of trodes and speaks of how there are now entire groups of freemen who curse their name at the
[02:54:27] preacher's bidding he joined one of the groups the Zar sadis Jessica is not sure of Duncan's intentions and they both know that fadin is having their conversation recorded she attempts to get more information out of Duncan but
[02:54:41] Duncan resist and wonders if he had finally reached the walls of her Benny JZ training Idaho backed away from her until he felt the door behind him he bowed once more I called you my lady and
[02:54:56] then never again my advice to fadan will be to send you back to walluk quietly and quickly at the earliest practical moment you are too dangerous a toy to keep around although I don't believe he
[02:55:08] thinks of you as a toy you are working for The Sisterhood not for the atraes I wonder now if you ever worked for the atres you witches moved too deeply and Darkly for mere mortals to ever trust
[02:55:23] aola considers himself a mere mortal she Jed compared to you he said leave she ordered such is my intention he slipped out the door passing the Curious stare
[02:55:37] of the servant who'd obviously been listening it's done he thought and they can read it only one way way outwardly it would seem that Duncan has abandoned house at Tres and gone
[02:55:50] over fully to house Kino but Duncan's inner monologue would suggest otherwise though there is a warrant for the arrest of the preacher on oracus he appears in the Square on quizat hatak day to give a sermon on the death of
[02:56:06] leato II AIA has disguised herself as a commoner and gone out into the crowd to hear she has long suspected that the preacher is in fact Paul and she fears him but knows she cannot harm him with a
[02:56:21] terrifying directness the preacher reached out grabbed Aaliyah's arm it was done without any groping or hesitation she tried to pull away but he held her in a painful grip speaking directly into
[02:56:34] her face as those around them edged back in confusion what did po trodes tell you woman he demanded how does he know I'm a woman she asked herself she wanted to sink into her inner lives ask their
[02:56:48] protection but the world within remained frightenedly silent mesmerized by this figure from their past he told you that completion equals Death the preacher shouted absolute prediction is
[02:57:02] completion is death she tried to pry his fingers away she wanted to grab her knife and slash him away from her but she dared not she had never felt this daunted in all her love life the
[02:57:14] preacher lifted his chin to speak over her to the crowd shouted I give you mu's words he said I'm going to rub your faces in things you try to avoid I don't find it strange that all you want to
[02:57:29] believe is only that which comforts you how else do humans invent the traps which betray us into mediocrity how else do we Define cowardice that's what mu Adib told you abruptly he released
[02:57:43] Aliyah's arm thrust her into the crowd she would have fallen but for the Press of people supporting her to exist is to stand out away from the background the preacher said you aren't thinking or
[02:57:58] really existing unless you're willing to risk even your own sanity in Judgment of your existence stepping down the preacher once more took Aaliyah's arm no faltering or hesitation he was gentler
[02:58:12] this time though leaning close he pitched his voice for her ears alone stop trying to pull me once more into the background sister then hand on his young gu's shoulder he stepped into the
[02:58:26] throne way was made for the strange pair hands reached out to touch the preacher but people reached with an awesome tenderness fearful of what they might find beneath that Dusty fman robe Aaliyah stood alone in her shock as the
[02:58:41] throng moved out behind the preacher certainty filled her it was Paul no doubt remained it was her brother abandon
[02:58:54] certainty that's life's deepest command that's what life's all about we probe into the unknown into the uncertain why can't you hear muadi if certainty is knowing absolutely
[02:59:09] an absolute future then that's only death disguised such a future becomes now leato has driven a worm deep into the desert and has finally found the
[02:59:22] place he believes to be jakaro to but he is concerned when he can find no trace of water he heads to the SI and is captured by a man who forces him unconscious when leato wakes he sees Nam
[02:59:37] father of Javid the lover and servant of Aaliyah Nam tells him that he must complete schooling in this place place and if he didn't he would die Nam also tells leato that he soon will come face
[02:59:50] to face with the man who captured him when leato wakes again he sees the face of none other than gurny hoc who was sent to capture him on Jessica's orders their plan is to force leato to undergo
[03:00:02] the spice trance as Paul did and begin unlocking his vision he saw the illusion the entire illusion process rotated ated half a turn and now he knew
[03:00:16] a center from which he could watch without purpose the flight of his visions of his inner lives Eli flooded him it made him want to laugh but he denied himself this luxury knowing it
[03:00:29] would bar the doors of memory ah my memories he thought I have seen your illusion you no longer invent the next moment for me you merely show me how to
[03:00:42] create new moments I not lock myself on the old tracks repeatedly he was forced into spice trance and each time he came out nry and gurnie were unsure whether or not to slay him leato sees much in
[03:00:57] his visions and at times nearly loses sight of himself within the boundaries of time he tells nry and gurnie that the problem with his father's rule of the empire was that it sought to bring peace
[03:01:09] but however peace was only defined by a specific way of life which did not leave people contented he tells gurnie that he will indeed one day work with The Sisterhood but they will not like it the Visions
[03:01:24] cause leer to grow very weak and he curses his grandmother for utilizing such a drawn out gum Jabar meanwhile ilon and Ayah have been trying to convince ganima to accept farin's
[03:01:36] proposal ganimat is furious and wants to kill fadin as revenge for Leo's death even though he has blamed his mother for the attack iron even at one point attempts to use voice on ganima but this backfires
[03:01:52] horribly why' you and Aaliyah grow so suddenly quiet iron asked reverting to her previous question but casting it now in a delicate mode of voice ganima threw
[03:02:03] back her head in laughter iron you try Voice on me what iron was taken aback you teach your grandmother to suck eggs ganima said i' what the fact that I
[03:02:17] remember the expression and you've never heard it before should give you pause ganima said it was an old expression of scor when you B JZ were young ganima is done being treated like a child and
[03:02:30] angrily insists that iron and Aaliyah leave her presence but Aaliyah is intrigued by gima's anger and makes a deal with her she will marry farodin to get the lady Jessica back but she would
[03:02:43] kill far in the first chance she got though iron is against this ganima is insistent on salusa sandis Jessica has begun the slow process of training farodin in the Ben jeser ways farodin
[03:02:58] learns the teachings faster than Jessica expected but he is still in the very early stages during the storm leato escapes giey into the desert he takes a still suit and a still
[03:03:11] tint with him leato heads directly into the storm and hides within the tent to wait it out however when he awakes he finds the hill pumps on his still suit have been cut and he has lost half of
[03:03:24] his water he finds a worm and rides it deeper into the desert until he comes across a band of fan Renegades he soon discerns that they are from shulock stories of shulock were often
[03:03:38] shared amongst Freeman everyone considered it to be a myth a place for interesting things to happen only for the sake of a story leato has now fully realized what has happened the original
[03:03:52] jakar rutu had indeed been renamed fondak and had become a place for Smugglers but the cast out of jakar rutu had gone to shulak he knows that this is where he
[03:04:03] will find the preacher he reveals to muris that he is the son of Paul atraes and tells him that if they kill him his people will sink into the sand but if they let him live he will lead them to
[03:04:17] Greatness an uneasy Alliance is formed between leato and mirus you speak of leading us mirus said freemen are led by men who have been
[03:04:27] blooded what can you lead us in kazac leato said keeping his attention on the crouched figure miris glared at him brows contracted over his Indigo eyes
[03:04:42] kisac that wasn't merely a war or revolution that was the typhoon struggle it was a word from the furthermost fman Legends the battle at the end of the
[03:04:54] universe kisc in the Dune universe kazac is the long foretold Mythic battle at the end of the universe a legend but here leato implies that it is actually
[03:05:08] real back at fondak Nam reveals to gurnie that he has in fact been following the orders of Aaliyah and not Jessica as he believed it was Aaliyah who wished to subject leato to the spice
[03:05:21] trance gurnie ends up killing the man and escapes to find sgar knowing that Aaliyah will want him dead in shulock the golden path begins leato goes to the canat where the
[03:05:35] worms and the sand trout are kept the cast out of shulock have been selling the worms off world though they do not live long leato allows one of the sand trout to cover his hand on oracus fman children
[03:05:49] often played a game if a sand trout was placed in a hand it would sense the water in the capillaries and cover the entire hand eventually the sand trout glove would fall off having been repelled by something in the blood's
[03:06:03] water sand trout can join together locking body to body in order to become a single sack likee organism enclosing a body of water he allows to sand trout to cover his whole body creating a sand
[03:06:16] trout membrane which behaves like a living permanent still suit the sand trout membrane adjusted to Leo's body and begin integrating changing him into something not quite human something
[03:06:29] Beyond human the sand trout had never before encountered a body containing so much spice leato adjusted his internal enzymes and Blended himself with the sand trout feeding it and feeding on it
[03:06:44] his vision provided all the knowledge he needed to do so and he followed it perfectly the sand trout was no longer sand trout but something tougher and stronger and he knew that it would only
[03:06:57] grow stronger giving him Godlike strength and speed he got to his feet turned to run back toward the Hut as he moved he found his feet moving too fast for him to balance he plunged into the
[03:07:10] sand rolled and leaped to his feet the leap took him 2 m off the sand and when he fell back trying to walk he again moved too fast stop he commanded himself he fell into the pranab bendu forced
[03:07:24] relaxation Gathering his senses into the pool of Consciousness this focused the inward ripples of the constant now through which he experienced time and he allowed the vision Elation to warm him
[03:07:37] the membrane worked precisely as the vision had predicted my skin is not my own the sand trout membrane would also provide lato with unlimited spice and he could swim through the Sands with
[03:07:51] lightning speed face to face leato confronts a worm out in the Deep desert he finds that it will not harm him worms will not attack sand Trout the deep sand Vector of its own
[03:08:04] kind he decides that he will use his powers to destroy the center's key to the ecological transformation of oracus this would set the transformation back decades and would allow leato to rearrange the plan for racus he knew
[03:08:19] that only the necessities of his vision mattered now only the golden path could come from this ordeal here was the Great Leap onto the golden path he had put on the living
[03:08:33] self-repairing still suit of a sand trout membrane a thing of unmeasurable value on araus until you understood the price I am no longer human the legends
[03:08:46] about this night will grow and magnify it beyond anything recognizable by the participants but it will become truth that legend in the Deep desert leato places
[03:08:58] himself in the path of Paul's worm and the creature stops Paul's guide is Tariq son of MZ leato reveals himself and insists that he and his father spend the
[03:09:09] evening together using a pseudo Shi Tariq attempts to kill Paul and leato by utilizing the maddening effect that the Holzman effect has on the great worms nothing could stop a worm in the presence of a shield not water or the
[03:09:25] presence of sand trout Tariq had been commanded by jackar to do away with both atres it is at this point that the separate visions of Paul and leato come into conflict the preacher following the
[03:09:40] sound of Leo's voice clambered up the Doom Moon slope and stood two paces away it was done with a swift shess which told leato this would be no easy contest here the Visions parted when Paul walked
[03:09:54] into the desert many years ago he had truly wanted to die when the baby lato had shared sight with him Paul had had a vision he was resigned to be a tool of Revenge for
[03:10:07] jaru jaru had been waiting for him that night as he knew they would be they wanted his Visions but he gave them none even when they forced him into trance using the spice Essence he had baited
[03:10:21] Aaliyah confused and tempted her into making incorrect decisions jutu used Paul as bait to trap Aaliyah and now she knows that the preacher is indeed Paul
[03:10:34] Paul is prepared to die he ran from Leo's vision and leato felt the tension grow between himself and his father it was a shadowplay all around them a projection of unconscious forms and
[03:10:48] leato felt the memories of his father a form of backwards prophecy which sorted Visions from The Familiar reality of this moment Paul insist leato that he can not control the future but leato knew that
[03:11:03] one of them would have to act make a decision choosing a vision leato understood however that Paul was correct attempting to take ultimate control of the universe could only lead to the
[03:11:16] ultimate defeat of you to manage such a vision required a balance of a single thin thread to play God on a tight wire with Cosmic Solitude on both
[03:11:29] sides leato had committed himself down a path in which there was now no turning back from and he had accepted the consequences of that choice Paul however had made no final commitment though Paul
[03:11:42] Paul begs him not to leato stayed in line with his own Vision he jumps meters into the air catching Tariq and breaking his neck instantly then he dug the pseudo Shield out of the ground and
[03:11:55] hurled it far off in the distance Paul had been defeated here leato looked upon his father and saw a blind angry man full of Despair do you really know the universe
[03:12:08] you have created here leato heard the particular in is the vision which both of them knew had been sent into terrible motion here had required an Act of Creation at a certain point in time for
[03:12:22] that moment the entire sentient Universe shared a linear view of time which possessed characteristics of orderly progression they entered this time as they might step onto a moving vehicle
[03:12:35] and they could only leave it the same way leato had locked Humanity into his vision they could not leave it Paul asks leato if he is truly prepared to commit to his fate if he is
[03:12:48] truly willing to change and live for thousands of years he wonders if leato is ready to accept what he will be to the universe do you wish to live those thousands of years changing as you know
[03:13:03] you will change Leo recognized that his father was not speaking about physical changes both of them knew the physical changes Leo would adapt and adapt the skin which was not his own would adapt
[03:13:16] and adapt The evolutionary thrust of each part would melt into the other and a single transformation would emerge when metamorphosis came if it came a thinking creature of awesome Dimensions
[03:13:29] would emerge upon the universe and that Universe would worship him no Paul was referring to the inner changes the thoughts and decisions which would inflict themselves upon the worshippers
[03:13:42] it is here that leato first speaks of his metamorphosis the millennial long change that will shape his body into an inhuman form he would be worshiped and his grip upon the universe will be stronger than Paul's ever was or could
[03:13:57] have ever dreamed to be thousands of peaceful years leato said that's what I'll give them Dorman SE stagnation of course and those forms of
[03:14:10] violence which I permit it will be a lesson which humankind will never forget I spit on your lesson Paul said you think I've not seen a thing similar to
[03:14:22] what you choose you saw it leato agreed is your vision any better than mine not one wit better worse perhaps Leos said then what can I do but resist
[03:14:38] you Paul demanded Paul concedes to l acknowledging that this is his Universe now he knew that he would have no Comfort this night or any other he knew
[03:14:50] that muad must be destroyed Paul a trodes the hero must die only the preacher could survive he would do Leo's bidding Aaliyah has now begun to show
[03:15:04] signs of possession in her physical form her flesh is beginning to change from the prolonged abomination she has grown more and more deranged dunan Idaho now on arus is at SI Tabor
[03:15:19] and has been trying to convince sgar that Aaliyah is possessed but sgar is unsure of Duncan's motives Javid Aliyah lover is also at tubor and when Duncan
[03:15:31] sees him he is overcome with rage he murders Javid stillar is extremely angry that Duncan had defiled the SI breaking its neutrality Duncan provokes sgar insulting him in
[03:15:46] ways in which a fan cannot ignore you've defiled my honor stillar cried this is neutral shut up Duncan glared at the shock na you wear a CER stillar it was
[03:16:00] one of the three most deadly insults which could be directed at a freman sar's face went pale you're a servant Idaho said you sold fan for their water
[03:16:13] this was the second most deadly insult the one which had destroyed the original jakar rutu stillar grounded his teeth put a hand on his Cris knife the aid stepped back away from the body in the
[03:16:26] doorway turning his back on the naib Idaho stepped into the door taking the narrow opening beside javid's body and speaking without turning delivered the third insult you have no immortality

[03:16:53] from the poles to find jakar rutu Idaho said still not turning stillar drew his knife perhaps I can help you Idaho was at the outer lip of the passage now without stopping he said if you'd help

[03:17:21] Idaho in the outer passage one gnarled hand jerked Idaho around and to a stop stillar confronted Idaho had bared teeth and a drawn knife such was his rage that stillar did not even see the Curious
[03:17:35] smile on Idaho's face draw your knife minat scum stillar roared Idaho laughed laughed he cuffed still gar shoply left hand right hand two stinging slaps to
[03:17:47] the head with an incoherent Screech sgar drove his knife into Idaho's abdomen striking upward through the diaphragm Into the Heart Idaho sagged onto the blade grinned up at sgar whose rage

[03:19:35] been traveling for months ganima notices how the shattered canat have been affecting the land and the behavior of the fan the desert demon is of course leato who is now worshiped by the cast
[03:19:48] out at shulock when he had brought gurnie HCK and the preacher there he had demonstrated his power to the men of the cast out with his bare heads leato had breached the shulock canak hurling large
[03:20:02] Stones more than 50 m when the cast out had tried to intervene leato had decapitate the first to reach him using no more than a blurred sweep of his arm he hurled others back into their Companions and had laughed at their

[03:21:20] what will happen Jessica is struck by this but she could not deny Aaliyah's words Paul at Tres Now lies dead in a mound of bloody Rags amongst the temple
[03:21:32] steps at that moment the thick plle construction that was the door to alyas Chambers flew off the hinges and came Hur curling into the room the guards leaped out of the way to avoid
[03:21:46] it in walked leato holding ganima by the arm as she attempted to escape him but he shook her arm and her whole body shook with it uttering a trigger word later breaks gima's memory conditioning
[03:22:01] here is Aria the atries Lioness we come to set you onto Suchi the golden path ganima absorbing the trigger words such AI felt the
[03:22:14] locked away Consciousness flow into her mind it flowed with a linear nicity the inner awareness of her mother hovering there behind it a guardian at a gate and ganima knew in that instant
[03:22:28] that she had conquered the clamorous past she possessed a gate through which she could peer when she needed into that past the months of self-hypnotic suppression had built for her a safe
[03:22:41] place from which to manage her own flesh gima's conditioning is broken and through this ganima has overcome the possibility of abomination she can now freely look through the memories of her
[03:22:54] past lives without fear of possession Aliyah commands her guards to seize leato but seeing his awesome power they refuse to enter the room leato walks across the room towards Aaliyah and
[03:23:08] though she tries to fight him he deals with her EAS it is here that the inner lives of Aaliyah's mind come to the surface and her possession is there for all to see
[03:23:20] Aliyah's eyes darted wildly from side to side I have conquered those inner lives leato said look at GH she too can ganima interrupted Aaliyah I can show you no
[03:23:35] the word was wrenched from Aaliyah her chest heaved and the voices begin to pour from her mouth they were disconnected cursing pleading you see why didn't you listen and again what are
[03:23:49] you doing what's happening and another voice stop make them stop Jessica covered her eyes felt farin's hands steady her still Aaliyah raved I'll kill you hideous curses erupted from her I'll
[03:24:03] drink your blood the sound of many languages begin to pour from her all jumbled and Confused the huddled guards in the the outer passage made the sign of the worm then held clinch fist beside their ears she was
[03:24:18] possessed shaking his head at the sight of Aaliyah leato walks to one of the windows and breaks the supposedly unbreakable Crystal reinforced glass from its frame Aaliyah rolled to her
[03:24:30] knees lurched to her feet don't you know who I am she demanded it was her old voice the sweet and lilting voice of the youthful Aaliyah who was no more why are you all looking at me that way she
[03:24:45] turned pleading eyes to Jessica mother make them stop Jessica could only shake her head from side to side consumed by ultimate horror all of the Benny jzr warnings were true she looked at leato
[03:24:59] and gani standing side by side near Aaliyah it is then that the baron himself speaks from Aliyah's mouth both leato and ganima recognized his voice from their own inner lives ganima began
[03:25:13] to hear the same voice echo in her mind but the inner gate sealed and in the Barron's place she sensed her mother Chie standing there leato gives Aaliyah a choice the trial of possession or the
[03:25:26] window who are you to give me a choice Aaliyah demanded and it was still the voice of The Old baren Demon ganima screamed let her make her own choice mother Aaliyah pleaded in her little
[03:25:41] girl tones mother what are they doing what do they want me to do help me help yourself leato ordered for just an instant he saw the shattered presence of his aunt in her eyes a glaring
[03:25:55] hopelessness which peered out at him and was gone but her body moved a stick-like thrusting walk she wavered stumbled veered from her path but returned to it
[03:26:08] nearer and nearer the open window now The Voice of the old baren raged from her lips stop it stop it I say I command you stop it feel this Aaliyah clutched
[03:26:21] her head stumbled closer to the window she had the sill against her thighs then but the voice still raged don't do this stop it I'll help you I have a plan listen to me stop it I say wait but
[03:26:35] Aaliyah pulled her hands away from her head clutched the broken casement in one jerking motion she pulled herself over the sill and was gone not even a screech came from her as she
[03:26:47] fell in one instant of awareness Aaliyah was as she once was and in that moment Aaliyah overcame her possession killing the baron for the second time there is a
[03:27:00] thump and the crowd below can be heard screaming Jessica is overcome with grief for the daughter she abandoned for the daughter she lost long ago though Humanity will not know it leato
[03:27:14] has made a great sacrifice for them the skin which is not his own can never be shed he is no longer human and in 4,000 years the complete metamorphosis of the sand trout symbiote will destroy him the
[03:27:29] pain of his life is great because the memory of being human is richer in lato than any other person think of all those lives cousin no you cannot imagine what that is
[03:27:42] because you've no experience of it but I know I can imagine his pain he gives more than anyone ever gave before our father walked into the desert trying to
[03:27:55] escape it Aaliyah became abomination in fear of it our grandmother has only the Blurred infancy of this condition yet must use every bny JZ wild to live with it which is what Reverend mother
[03:28:09] training amounts to anyway but leato he's all alone never to be duplicated leato is taking over the Benny jzr sisterhood's breeding program
[03:28:22] since he is no longer human he cannot continue the atres bloodline instead he will continue it through ganima and farodin he will himself marry ganima but no one will know that fadin is the true
[03:28:36] father of her children all leato does now is for the golden pth PA he will prepare Humanity for kazac saving them though they will call him Tyrant he'll
[03:28:48] lead humans through the cult of death into the free air of exuberant life he speaks of death because that's necessary still it's a tension by which the living
[03:29:00] know they're alive when his Empire Falls oh yes it'll fall you think kazac is now but kazac is yet to come and when it comes humans will have renewed their
[03:29:15] memory of what it's like to be alive most of the great worms would be gone in a 100 years The Guild whose Navigators require such high quantities of spice would nearly perish in these famine
[03:29:29] times but they will persist once leato returns into the Sands of araus so will the worms and Mankind will arise From the Ashes of kazek leato renames farodin hak alad
[03:29:44] which means the breaking of the Habit He commands him to hand over his Sardar soldiers leato intends to mingle them with the fan in the final chapter of Children of Dune leato reveals to hak
[03:29:58] Aladar that he is in fact possessed Abomination by the bzr definition leato had forced back most of his malevolent ego memories but he had allowed one to
[03:30:10] take root the ego memory of a man named Haram a man who had bred humans who were short-lived and prone to Superstition easily led by a god king leato believes
[03:30:24] they were a powerful people whose survival as a species became habitual leato mentions that the reason the Ben jzr breeding program failed was because they attempted to control Evolution
[03:30:38] while overlooking their own changes over the course of that Evolution he has no such Illusions I refuse faran said you refuse
[03:30:50] to Father an atres Dynasty what dynasty you'll occupy the throne for thousands of years and mold your descendants in my image it will be the most intensive the
[03:31:03] most inclusive training program in all of history will be an ecosystem in miniature you see when whatever system animals choose to survive by must be based on the pattern of interlocking
[03:31:16] communities interdependence working together in the common design which is the system and this system will produce the most knowledgeable rulers ever seen you put fancy words on a most
[03:31:30] distasteful who will survive kazac leato asked I promise you kazac will come you're a Madman you will shatter the empire of course I will and I am not a man but
[03:31:45] I'll create a new Consciousness in all men I tell you that below the desert of Dune there is a secret place with the greatest Treasure of all time I do not
[03:31:56] lie when the last worm dies and the last mange is harvested Upon Our Sands these deep Treasures will spring up throughout our universe as the power of the spice Monopoly Fades and the hidden stockpiles
[03:32:11] make their Mark new powers will appear throughout our realm it is time humans learned once more to live in their instincts leato will bring peace and stagnation to humanity for thousands of
[03:32:25] years and then kazac new strange Powers will arise and humans yet again will feel the tension of death farodin insists that he will resist leato but leato tells him that he expects him to
[03:32:40] to and that this is in fact the reason he was chosen leato stands alone in the universe he walks in solitude carrying the weight of all
[03:32:53] mankind one of us had to accept the agony gima said and he was always the stronger Children of Dune is the completion of the first Trilogy in the
[03:33:05] Dune series it is the beginning of Leo's long-term plan for history leato has made this sacrifice knowing that Humanity will curse his name for it they could not possibly understand how
[03:33:20] one whose Vision stretches to the End of Time sees the universe Children of Dune is regarded as one of the greatest science fiction books of all time intense action and a gripping plot this novel unlike Doom
[03:33:35] Messiah is a sweeping epic much like the original dun novel there are multiple parallels s between Paul and leato Children of Dune also shows the downfall of Aaliyah who succumbs to possession by the baron har Conan Aaliyah had no
[03:33:50] choice in her life this makes her end all the more tragic the next book in the series God emperor of Dune takes place 3500 years later it is in my opinion the
[03:34:02] most profound novel in the series in it leato has morphed into the worm God Emperor and rules the Imperium with an iron fist continuing to shape his golden
[03:34:16] [Music] path I assure you that I am the book of Fate questions are my enemies for my
[03:34:33] questions explode answers leap up like a frightened flock blackening the sky of my inescapable memories not one answer not one suffices what prisms flash when I enter
[03:34:47] the terrible field of my past I am a chip of shattered Flint enclosed in a box the box gyrates and Quakes I am tossed about in A Storm of mysteries and when the Box opens I
[03:35:03] return to this presence Like a Stranger In A Primitive land slowly slowly I say I learn my name but that is not to know
[03:35:14] myself this person of my name this leato who is the second of that calling finds other voices in his mind other names and other places oh I promise you as I have
[03:35:28] been promised that I answer to but a single name if you say lato I respond sufferance makes this true sufferance and one thing
[03:35:41] more I hold the threads all of them are mine let me but imagine a topic say men who have died by the sword and I have them in all their Gore every image
[03:35:54] intact every moan every grimus joys of motherhood I think and the birthing beds are mine serial baby smiles and the sweet coings of new generations the first
[03:36:10] of use brought forth for me to share they tumble one upon another until I can see little else but samess and repetition keep it all intact I warn
[03:36:23] myself who can deny the value of such experiences the worth of learning through which I view each new instant ah but it's the past don't you
[03:36:35] understand it's only the past this morning I was born in a yurt at the edge of a horse plane in a Land of a planet that no longer exist tomorrow I will be born somewhere
[03:36:49] else in another place I have not yet chosen this morning though ah this life when my eyes had learned to focus I looked out at sunshine on trampled grass
[03:37:04] and I saw vigorous people going about the sweet activities of their lives where where oh where has all of that Vigor gone the god Emperor leato II The Stolen
[03:37:19] journals but it's like a balloon the surface of the balloon is the interface with what we do not know inside the balloon as we blow into it is
[03:37:30] what we have proved but as we increase what we think we know we increase our exposure to what we do not know this is one of the inevitable laws of our
[03:37:46] universe but isn't it more interesting to live in a universe where there are unknowns to discover new lands to
[03:38:00] explore then to live in an absolute box where when you find the edge no place to go from there I like the fact that we cannot predict every I like the fact that we
[03:38:13] live in a universe or anything may happen because the alternative to me is a constricting dead
[03:38:24] [Music] end God emperor of Dune is the fourth book in Frank Herbert's Dune Saga the
[03:38:41] novel takes place 3,500 years after the events of the previous novel in the series Children of Dune leato II of how satris has ruled the Empire with an iron
[03:38:53] fist since that time the sand trout skin which leato had first put on in shoock has grown and changed him in the early stages of Leo's transformation which is referred to in the novels as his
[03:39:08] metamorphosis leato was mostly human the Symbiote skin had given him incredibly Amplified strength immunity to Conventional attacks and prevented him from aging but leato always knew what
[03:39:22] would become of him eventually the skin which was not his own consisted of many interlocking tiny sand vectors leato knew that approximately 4,000 years after he had put on the living suit the
[03:39:36] completed transformation of the sand trout into their adult worm phase would destroy him leato calls this his final metamorphosis I often think about my final
[03:39:49] metamorphosis that likeness of death I know the way it must come but I do not know the moment or the players this is one thing I cannot know I only know whether the golden path continues or
[03:40:04] ends the golden path is Leo's grand plan for Humanity it is a path that his father Paul lra saw but rejected in the time that the god emperor of Doom takes place leato and the sand trout cilia
[03:40:18] have become one body leato is a pre-or 7 m long and 2 m in diameter his body weighs approximately 5 tons and is carried around by the Royal cart a technology created by the iians one of
[03:40:33] The Fringe worlds on the outskirts of the Empire who maintain rule over their home planet through technocracy Leo's body is ribbed down its length only his face remains it is at the height it would be had he a man's
[03:40:47] body though his arms and hands were still functional and seemingly human his legs had atrophied and become useless long ago mostly leato was in control of the pre-or body but there are also
[03:41:01] reflexes Beyond his control the pre-or body for instance would react to protect itself if threatened the god Emperor maintained Supreme control over the universe oracus is now
[03:41:15] a wet Planet fully terraformed with clouds lakes and rivers and Forest the great worms of araus died out long ago and no more spice is being produced leato kept his horde of spice well
[03:41:30] hidden no one truly knew how much he possessed the spacing Guild's dependency on Spice made them almost reliable as allies no one moved in the universe without the
[03:41:43] permission of the god Emperor all spice in the universe was rationed by the god Emperor himself and he could deny rations to those who displeased him much of the novel God emperor of Dune is told
[03:41:56] from the perspective of leato II by use of an ixian device called a dictator leato can cast his thoughts in a particular mode and have the words printed out on rulan crystal sheets one
[03:42:09] r julan Crystal sheet is a mere molecule in thickness leato could then have them copied onto less permanent material God emperor of Dune op sometime in the distant future as the god
[03:42:23] Emperor's journals which were discovered long after his death are being read and studied for historical Insight these journals are a completion to the legendary documents known as Leto's stolen journals which were stolen from
[03:42:37] The Citadel on arus during his reign as God Emperor the plot begins as ciona atraes escapes with the stolen journals two books printed on crystal paper ciona is
[03:42:50] highly important to leato the most recent result of his breeding program which he had snatched from the Benny jzr Sisterhood over 3,000 years ago as ciona and her party escapes with the god
[03:43:03] Emperor's journals leato dewols are Unleashed upon them they had stolen the journals from The Fortress in the serer ciona and her two accompli are pursued by the creatures through Leo's Forbidden
[03:43:16] Forest ulot dies first as one of the Wolves violently rips out his shoulder and the rest of the pack pounces the D wolves were allowed to eat anything they caught in the Forbidden Forest but the D
[03:43:29] wolves did not stop to eat they knew that two more humans ran through the forest the second to die was cout whose ancestor had served at sich toor back in the days when araus was still
[03:43:42] called Dune SAA had been the fastest which is why she had been holding the packet containing the stolen journals they had known the risk would be great but they knew that the secret of where leato hoarded his spice would
[03:43:57] be worth it cout had sacrificed himself delaying the D wolves to help Sia escape with the journals once CA escapes the forest and crosses the Idaho river the wolves do not cross it they had been
[03:44:11] conditioned to stop at the water to know the boundaries of their territories ciona had escaped with two of Leo's journals items of immeasurable value Sia knows that the people of the
[03:44:24] Imperium have no true lives of their own the populace lived in neat rectangular houses with flat black roofs constant sameness and this was repeated on every planet in the worm God's Empire even
[03:44:38] planetary capitals she said were nothing more than large villages of the kind found everywhere in the Empire even though even the poorest families are wellfed their daily lives grow more and
[03:44:51] more static with the passage of time ciona admires the ancient Freeman because they were truly free in the worms Empire you went only where the worm demanded according to the god
[03:45:03] Emperor this was for the sake of Leo's peace but ciona had spied on the god Emperor and her father Mano as a child and what she had heard had planted a seed of hatred for leato in her mind he

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
03:45:16] says he denies us most crisis to limit our forming forces he said people can be sustained by Affliction but I am the Affliction now Gods can become afflictions those
[03:45:31] were his words Duncan the worm is a sickness Sia atraes despises the worm God and vows that she will be his end in Sia's mind leato has no right to call himself God no right to impose his
[03:45:46] tyranny upon the universe she is certain that the information in his journals will be enough to undo him Sia calls the worm's Empire a prison I will destroy
[03:45:57] you leato not we will destroy you that was not Sia's way she would do it herself she turned and strolled toward the Orchards beyond the river's mold border as she walked she repeated her oath
[03:46:12] adding to it aloud the old fan formula which terminated in her full namea IIs it is who curses you leato you will
[03:46:24] pay in full leato finds CA fascinating he had not predicted that she would take the journals this gave him great pleasure he had watched her in the Forbidden Forest by use of his devices
[03:46:38] he could have stopped the D Wolves at any time but chose not to calling them an extension of his purpose his purpose to be the greatest Predator that mankind has ever known throughout the Millennia leato II
[03:46:53] has had the TAC Su produce countless Duncan idah holas leato used Duncan idah HOAs as his commander of the royal guard he also used them in his breeding program occasionally the Duncan always
[03:47:06] trended towards subversion however but this was precisely the reason that the Duncans were used at the start of the novel Leo's current Duncan who has served him in the past 60 years attempts
[03:47:20] to kill him after discovering that the TXU are working on his replacement he knows that leato II has vowed not to use his preent power to predict the moment of his own death and he believes that a Lason can kill him the Duncan concealing
[03:47:34] the weapon which leato already knows about having been informed by The Guild had come to talk to leato about ciona and her Rebellion this bores the god Emperor he recognizes predictable patterns in the rebellious all
[03:47:48] rebellions are ordinary and an ultimate bore they are copied out of the same pattern one much like another the driving force is adrenaline addiction and the desire to gain personal power all Rebels are closet Aristocrats that's
[03:48:02] why I can convert them so easily why do the Duncans never really hear me when I tell them about this the god Emperor insists that radicals always see the world in binary terms simple US versus
[03:48:15] them or good versus evil in addressing more complex issues this way these radicals create a window into chaos the god Emperor states that government is the Mastery of chaos which contrary to
[03:48:28] the belief of many has predictable characteristics leato says that radicals only create New Radicals continuing the old process a radical that saw the complexities however was in fact no true
[03:48:42] radical but a rival for leadership and must either be killed or coopted Duncan I am all of them and I know there has never truly been a selfless Rebel just Hypocrites conscious
[03:48:58] Hypocrites or unconscious Hypocrites it's all the same lost in thought and bored of the talk of rebels leato does not initially notice the lcon that the Duncan has pointed directly at him
[03:49:10] you Duncan have you betrayed me too to brute every fiber of Leo's awareness came to full alert he could feel his body twitching the worm flesh
[03:49:22] had a will of its own Idaho spoke with perion tell me leato how many times must I pay the debt of loyalty leato recognized the inner question how many of me have there been the Duncan always
[03:49:37] wanted to know this every dun Duncan asked it and no answer satisfied they doubted in his saddest muad voice leato asked do you take no pride in my
[03:49:50] admiration Duncan haven't you ever wondered what it is about you that makes me desire you as my constant companion through the centuries you know me to be the ultimate fool Duncan the voice of an angry muad
[03:50:05] could always be counted on to shatter Idaho despite the fact that Idaho knew no Benny jzr had ever mastered the powers of voice as leato had mastered them it was predictable that he would dance to this one voice the L gun
[03:50:18] wavered in his hand that was enough leato was off the cart in a hurdling roll Idaho had never seen him leave the cart this way had not even suspected it could happen for leato there were only two requirements a real threat which the
[03:50:33] worm body could sense and the release of that body the rest was automatic and the speed of it always astonished even leato the Las gun was a major concern it could scratch him badly but few understood the abilities of the pre-warm body to deal
[03:50:48] with heat leato struck Idaho while rolling and the L gun was deflected as it was fired one of the useless flippers which had been Leo's legs and feet sent a shocking burst of Sensations crashing
[03:51:00] into his awareness for an instant there was only pain but the worm body was free to act and reflexes ignited a violent roxism of flopping leato heard bones cracking the L gun was thrown far across
[03:51:14] the floor of the crypt by a spasmodic jerk of Idaho's hand rolling off of Idaho leato poised himself for a renewed attack but there was no need the injured flipper still sent pain signals and he sensed that the tip of the flipper had
[03:51:29] been burned away the sand trout skin already sealed the wound the pain had eased to an ugly throbbing Idaho stirred there could be little doubt that he had been mortally injured his chest was
[03:51:41] visibly crushed there was obvious Agony when he tried to breathe but he opened his eyes and stared up at leato the Persistence of these mortal possessions
[03:51:52] leato thought siona Idaho gasped leato saw the life leave him then this was not the first time a Duncan had died by Leo's Hands In Truth only 19 Duncans had
[03:52:07] died by natural causes after the Duncan dies leato wonders if ciona and Duncan could have been mates but he dismisses the idea but leato does note however that the Duncan had been aiming for his
[03:52:20] brain his brain was no longer a brain of human Dimensions not even associated with his face it had spread throughout his body this was a fact he had told only to his journals inwardly leato
[03:52:34] possessed a vantage point by which to view his ancestral memories with without fear of being overcome he could reach back and gaze Through The Eyes of any person in those memories in this way he
[03:52:47] was unlike anyone who had ever lived before him even his sister ganima he had mastered his inner lives and could speak with the voices of his ancestors though his power is great it causes him to
[03:53:01] struggle with unbearable boredom having seen the near extent of all human potential leato said that to be thought of as a God as he was became ultimately boring the stolen journals state that
[03:53:15] Holy boredom is a good and sufficient enough reason for the invention of free will this is key in understanding the role that leato intends for ciona in his golden
[03:53:27] path Leo's rule of the universe was maintained by his fish speaker Legions the fish speakers were Leo's military force during his reign as God emperor of the Imperium finding that the fan and the Sardar were unable to suit his needs
[03:53:42] later thei founded his all female Army the fish speakers maintained Garrison on every planet throughout the Imperium according to the god Emperor male militaries were ultimately predatory and would eventually turn against the
[03:53:55] civilian population in times of Peace when there was no enemy to fight females on the other hand would remain calm and tamed during peace time fish peaker schools could be found in the Festival City on oracus
[03:54:09] leato had given them the name fish speakers because according to his genetic memory the first priestesses spoke to fish in their dreams leato said this was of Great Value the fish speakers were extremely loyal followers
[03:54:23] of the god Emperor's religion they reacted violently to anything they considered to be heresy against their one true God the fish speakers were the enforcers of leato Peace which was necessary for the golden path in terms
[03:54:37] of longevity and the number of planets ruled the fish speakers can be thought of as the most effective military force of all time men were almost completely shut out of the fish speaker combat forces the only role that men served in
[03:54:52] the lives of fish speaker women was that of husbands fish speakers were trained to be extremely effective disciplined and even fanatical soldiers leato how however rejected the idea that fisher
[03:55:05] should be thought of as a police force by my name I assure you that is not so police are inevitably corrupted police always observe that criminals Prosper it takes a pretty dull policeman to miss the fact
[03:55:19] that the position of authority is the most prosperous criminal position available the fish speakers could not be corrupted the fish speakers were more than an army the women also served as
[03:55:32] the god Emperor's governmental bureaucracy they were activists courtiers pages teachers fish speaker priestesses served as judge and jury and executioner the fish speakers also
[03:55:45] served roles as assassins and secret agents and any other use that the god Emperor saw fit a fish Beaker would fall upon her own blade without hesitation if leato commanded it nla is the most
[03:55:58] prominent fish fer in the Dune series nla was a large hulking figure her strength was legendary the god Emperor himself had once seen her lift a 100 kilo man with one hand she has been commanded to obey
[03:56:11] ciona atraes in all things by L of II even though CA plots to destroy the god Emperor this is a cause of great internal conflict for Nila but she trust in the will of God the god Emperor had
[03:56:25] also implanted technology of ixian manufacturer inside of n's head which would allow him to speak directly to her if he wished n wonders whether there may be a computer inside but dismisses the
[03:56:38] thought for it was God who put it there nla reported on all of siona's actions to the god Emperor her faith in him was unquestionable even if Sia SS you to kill me you must obey she must never
[03:56:52] learn that you serve me no one can kill you Lord but you must obey ciona of course Lord that is your command you must obey her in all things I will do it
[03:57:05] Lord n's Faith was such that even NATO himself could not shake her any obstacle she viewed as a test this religion built around my Pur and disgust me yes Lord n's green eyes
[03:57:20] on the Gilded cushions of her cheeks stared out at him without questioning without comprehension without the need of either response if I sent her out to collect the star she would go and she would attempt it she thinks I am testing
[03:57:33] her again I do believe she could anger me this damnable religion should end with me leato shouted why should I want to loose a religion upon my people religions wreck from within Empires and
[03:57:46] individuals alike it's all the same yes Lord religions create radicals and Fanatics like you thank you Lord the short-lived pseudo rage sank back out of sight into the depths of his memories
[03:58:01] nothing denied the hard surface of nla's faith nla is the perfect example of pure fanaticism ciona atraes is the descendant of ganima atraes in hak Aladar once known as fadin
[03:58:14] Corino ca's intelligence and Charisma has helped her to become a leader of a group of like-minded rebels they are determined to end the rule of the god Emperor she plans to give copies of leato journals to groups whose loyalty
[03:58:28] to the god Emperor is questionable including The benzar Sisterhood The Guild and the ience SAA does not find the location of Leo's spice horde but she does discover something else Sia
[03:58:41] shows nla a flower and a strand of hair which she found pressed in between two pages of paper on the paper read a strand of gima's hair with a starflower blossom which she once brought me on
[03:58:55] another page was written words I wrote when told of gan's death the sand beach as gray as a dead cheek a green tide flow reflects Cloud ripples
[03:59:09] I stand on the dark wet Edge cold foam cleanses my toes I smell Driftwood smoke Sia knew that with these words they had discovered the key to God's
[03:59:21] undoing the god Emperor loved his sister yes he is capable of love oh yes we have him now Mano atraes is ca's father and the
[03:59:35] closest and most loyal servant to the god emperor mono acted as major Domo of Leo's household the god Emperor thinks to himself what a gift mono has given him in his daughter CA knowing that she
[03:59:48] is the new while he himself is a collection of the old and obsolete a crypt of ancestral knowledge A Relic CA was more important to leato than she or
[03:59:59] mono knew CA had the ability to vanish from Leo's preent Vision at times though she was not aware she would fade and yet the golden path
[04:00:12] would remain but Sia in fact was not preent herself she was unique Sia had the potential if she survived Leo's test that is to be the one who could offer
[04:00:24] Humanity a clean slate the ultimate goal of Leo's breeding program someone who could hide from The preent View and spread those genes throughout all mankind mono in his youth had been a
[04:00:39] rebel just as ciona is now in fact most of Leo's trusted administrators had once been Rebels according to leato Rebels made for the best administrators and all Rebels were closet Aristocrats which was
[04:00:52] why he was able to convert them so easily later seemingly in contradiction to the statement leato says that in order to identify Rebels he looks for men with principles principles he said are what
[04:01:07] we fight for most men go through a lifetime unchallenged except at the final moment they have so few unfriendly Arenas in which to test themselves they have you
[04:01:19] she said but I am so powerful he said I am the equivalent of suicide who would seek certain death Madmen or desperate
[04:01:29] ones Rebels I am their equivalent to war he said the ultimate predator I am the cohesive force which shatters them leato says that a good administrator is
[04:01:44] Incorruptible shrewd philosophical and open about their errors and quick to see decisions the difference between a good administrator and a bad administrator is the fact that a good administrator can
[04:01:56] make immediate choices act on Instinct a bad administrator hesitates eventually acting in ways that create serious problems mono is concerned for his daughter's safety but make sure that the god Emperor knows that his own concerns
[04:02:11] are Paramount mono knows that ciona is dangerous and has placed to spy amongst her which leato already knows SI provides leato with surprise due to her ability to hide from his
[04:02:24] pressence but she also reminds leato of what he fears most of all the sameness and repetition that could potentially destroy the golden path ciona is the contrast by which I know my deepest
[04:02:37] fears mano's concern for me is well grounded I tell you this in the hope that it will help you understand why I act as I do in the full knowledge that great forces accumulate in my Empire
[04:02:53] with but one wish to destroy me you who read these words may know full well what actually happened but I doubt that you understand it though the manipulation of human
[04:03:06] genetics is forbidden by Leo's religion the tacu know how much he Treasures his Duncan they reproduce golas from the original cells from the original Duncan who died all the way back in the Dune
[04:03:19] days thus the Duncans all have the memories up until that original point of death the tacu do this in the hopes that it will buy them favor with the god Emperor it does not in the opening of God emperor of
[04:03:34] Dune a new Duncan awakes to a strange New World find in the planet oracus to be unrecognizable and the shape of the Empire to be completely different to how he remembered it he is a man out of his
[04:03:47] time I am Donan Idaho that was about all he wanted to know for sure he did not like the TXU explanations their stories but then that TXU had always been feared disbelieved and
[04:04:02] feared the new Idaho sometime after the death of his predecessor is escorted down to the planet oracus by TXU face dancers who make a game out of changing their faces constantly to confuse him they then tell him that the women of the
[04:04:17] royal guard will come for him soon they leave him there in a dull featureless room Idaho is confused by their statement since he is not aware of Leo's all female Army he is aware that he is a goola he remembered his own death and
[04:04:31] could not deny the truth initially upon Awakening he had been a blank slate there to be programmed in any way the T laxu wished they unblocked his memory by repeating the scenario which awoke Hate's memory in Children of Dune by
[04:04:46] conditioning him to kill a man so similar to Paul that Duncan believed that it was likely a goola though he wonders where the dirty T laxu would have gotten the cells of Paul trodes the god Emperor leato assures Duncan that it
[04:04:58] was no more than a face dancer mimic whilst among the TXU Duncan is allowed to study TXU history he learns of late until the second who was born 3,500 years ago and yet still lives as
[04:05:12] ruler of the universe but this second lato so the history said had become something something so strange that Idaho despaired of understanding the transformation How could a human slowly
[04:05:27] turn into a sandworm how could any thinking creature live more than 3,000 years not even the wildest projections of the geriatric spice allowed such a
[04:05:39] lifespan Duncan doesn't know what to believe he suspects clu lies it wouldn't be until he saw the worm God emperor that he would truly believe the TXU tell Duncan that the god
[04:05:52] Emperor is a tyrant and had ordered them to produce him from their Axel tanks they do not know what became of the one before him the presence of the new goola pleased the shadow of Paul atraes which
[04:06:05] lived Within leato leato had the new Duncan brought into a dark room where he could hear leato speak before he saw his form what do I call you it was the sign of acceptance for which leato had been
[04:06:19] waiting will Lord leato do yes my Lord Idaho stared directly into Leo's F and blue eyes is it true what your fish speakers say you have memories of we are
[04:06:33] all here Duncan leato spoke in the voice of his paternal grandfather then even the women are here Duncan it was the voice of Jessica Leo's paternal grandmother you knew them well leato
[04:06:46] said and they know you when the lights turned on Duncan saw Leo's body and he asked why leato had done this to himself leato told him that he would know in time he told the Duncan that eventually
[04:07:00] his body would make sand worms of some sort but they would be aware having more ganglia more neres El though Duncan begins to accept that leato is a traes he can still sense that something key is
[04:07:15] missing something has been stolen from humankind you've taken something away from us he said I can feel it those women mono us against you leato thought the
[04:07:29] Duncan always choose The Human Side Idaho returned his attention to Leo's face what have you given us in exchange throughout the Empire Leo's peace leato
[04:07:42] tells Duncan that his so-called peace is actually enforced Tranquility that the fish speakers are present because humans by Nature react negatively against Tranquility he gives them this and a
[04:07:54] hierarchy which they can easily identify a hierarchy where he is God though he tells Duncan that in truth Holiness is a curse and that it offends him but leato understands that it is necessary for the
[04:08:07] golden path which is a fact that the Duncan cannot yet comprehend leato tells the Duncan that his duty will be to guard him by any means necessary and also to guard his secret the secret that
[04:08:19] he is in fact vulnerable that he is not truly God in the ultimate sense Duncan still doesn't fully trust leato and tells him that he will turn against him if he should discover him to
[04:08:33] be worse than the har conans ultimately Duncan agrees to serve lato after the god Emperor reminds him who he truly is when we climb sieg to Bo for the last time together you had my
[04:08:46] loyalty then and I had yours nothing of that has really changed that was your father that was me Paul mu's voice of command coming from Leo's bulk always
[04:08:58] shocked the goas Idaho whispered all of you in that one body he broke off leato remained silent this was the decision moment presently Idaho permitted himself that devil
[04:09:13] mayare grin for which he had been so well known then I will speak to First leato and to Paul the ones who know me best use me well for I did love you the
[04:09:26] Duncan leaves the god Emperor then not knowing that his words had Disturbed him leato knew that in fact it was love that he was most vulnerable to the Ben jeser Sisterhood remains
[04:09:41] unbroken during the reign of the god Emperor leato mentions that out of all in the universe the Ben jeser Reverend mothers are the most like him having access to their ancestral Memories the Benny JZ as always make
[04:09:56] their plots he is aware of most of their efforts early on in the novel they attempt to form an alliance between the fish speakers and themselves but fail the fish speakers keep nothing from God
[04:10:08] you Ben jzr to sail me on all sides even now you seek to subborn my fish speakers sister chinay says that she stealed herself for death but the god Emperor merely stopped his cart and looked across her at his
[04:10:23] Entourage she says the others stopped and waited on the road in well-trained passivity all of them at a respectful distance the Lord leus said there is my little multitude and they tell me
[04:10:37] everything do not deny my accusation sister chanway said I do not deny it leato commands chenway to report his words back to The Sisterhood exactly he is fully aware of
[04:10:50] her special training as an oral recorder and of her true mission on oracus he tells her that he will restore the outward view the spiritual Freedom that Humanity had lost humans had been enclosed trapped
[04:11:05] behind latches and locks and most most humans were not strong enough to seek Freedom within themselves he tells the sister hood that as they succeeded in creating the quizat
[04:11:16] hatak he has succeeded in creating ciona though he does not elaborate for The Sisterhood the Ben Jes wonder about the God Emperor's reference to ciona and intend to investigate sister chin had also been

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
04:11:31] commanded by the god Emperor to withhold certain words from her report to The Sisterhood when chinay asked leato about his likeness to a reverend mother he responded by telling her that he and his sister were awakened in the womb he told
[04:11:45] her that because he knows that she had been told to record accurately whatever she heard that he would speak to her as though he was speaking to one of his journals he told her to preserve the words well for he did not want them lost
[04:12:00] when she asked him why he had chosen her he said it was because he would never see her again she did not understand his strange words the Lord leato spoke as follows to my certain knowledge when I
[04:12:14] am no longer consciously present here among you when I am here only as a fearsome creature of the desert many people will look back upon me as a tyrant fair enough I have been
[04:12:27] tyrannical a tyrant not fully human not insane merely a tyrant but even ordinary tyrants have motives and feelings Beyond those usually assigned to them by fasile
[04:12:41] historians and they will think of me as a great Tyrant thus my feelings and motives are a legacy I would preserve lest history distort them too much history has a way of magnifying some
[04:12:54] characteristics while it discards others people will try to understand me and frame me in their words they will seek truth but the truth always carries the ambiguity of the words used to express it
[04:13:07] you will not understand me the harder you try the more remote I will become until finally I vanish into Eternal myth a living God at last that's it you see I
[04:13:21] am not a leader nor even a guide a god remember that I am quite different from leaders and guides Gods need take no responsibility for anything except Genesis Gods accept everything and thus
[04:13:36] accept nothing Gods Must Be identifiable and yet remain anonymous gods do not need a spirit world my spirits dwell within me answerable to my slightest summons I
[04:13:48] share with you because it pleases me to do so what I have learned about them and through them they are my truth Beware of the truth gentle sister although much
[04:14:01] sought after truth can be dangerous to the Seeker myths and reassuring lies are much easier to find and believe if you find a truth even a temporary one it can
[04:14:14] demand that you make painful changes conceal Your Truth within words natural ambiguity will protect you then words are much easier to absorb than the sharp delic stabs of wordless
[04:14:28] portant with words you can cry out in the chorus why didn't someone warn me but I did warn you I warned you by example not with words there are inevitably more
[04:14:43] than enough words you record them in your marvelous memory even now and Someday my journals will be discovered more words I warn you that you read my words at your peril the wordless
[04:14:56] movement of terrible events lies just below their surface be deaf you do not need to hear or hearing you do not need to remember how soon soothing it is to forget and how
[04:15:10] dangerous words such as mine have long been recognized for their mysterious power there is secret knowledge here which can be used to rule the forgetful my truths are the substance of myths and lies which tyrants have always counted
[04:15:24] on to maneuver the masses for selfish design you see I share it all with you even the greatest mystery of all time the mystery by which I compose my life I
[04:15:37] reveal it to you in words the only past which endures lies wordlessly within you he tells her that he preserves these words for the future generations of mankind who will seek to unravel the
[04:15:51] mysteries of his rule to find meaning in their own existence Chino got the sense from Leo's words that he was uttering some kind of last Testament she asked the god Emperor if he is telling her this because he is
[04:16:05] about to die leato laughs no gentle sister it is you who will die you will not live to be a reverend mother do not be saddened by this for by your presence
[04:16:19] here today by carrying my message back to The Sisterhood by preserving my secret words as well you will achieve a far greater status you become here an
[04:16:32] integral part of my myth our distant cousins will pray to you for intercession with me leato has seen Chino's death in his preent vision and tells her so in that
[04:16:45] moment the Benny JZ sister chenway and the Lord leato share something almost physical a mutual experience of worldless Truth chin is unable to describe it this account was found
[04:16:58] amongst Chin's papers after her death she died in the 53rd year of her Sisterhood when she underwent the spice agony in an attempt to convert the deadly truth saer drug and become a reverend
[04:17:11] mother the god Emperor completely denies The Sisterhood any involvement in his breeding program the fish speaker garrisons on the Benny jzer home World killed the children of The Sisterhood who result from genetic lines which they
[04:17:25] object to as a result The Sisterhood struggles to maintain their level of Reverend mothers when The Sisterhood protested this to the god Emperor he responded with the warning be thankful for what
[04:17:38] you have The Sisterhood understood The Sisterhood does not question Leo's preent abilities and know him to be more powerful than any before him they believe that he knows every important action that they will take
[04:17:53] prior to the event and therefore guide themselves by the rule that they will never knowingly threaten his person or his grand plan which they can discern parts of the sisterhood's official
[04:18:04] address to the god Emperor is as follows tell us if we threaten you that we may desist and tell us of your grand plan that we may help The Sisterhood is also aware that the guild and the iians work
[04:18:19] together to develop a mechanical substitute to the preent power of a navigator The Sisterhood does not suspect that much will come of this though they are watchful the success of the project could mean the reduction of
[04:18:32] the god Emperor's power in the universe since spice would no longer be requ required for safe space travel the god Emperor has many devices of ixan manufacturer many of them defy the
[04:18:45] prescriptions of the butlerian Jihad containing thinking machines early on in his Reign leato had revealed to the iians that he knew the secret location of their ixian core the heartland of
[04:18:58] their technological Federation he had seen the location in his prean the technology of the iians is feared throughout the empire only once had the ixian attempted to trick him with a violent device he had killed the entire delegation before the
[04:19:13] package was even opened in the novel The ixian send a new ambassador to the court of the god Emperor we Nori shortly after her arrival on the planet she meets with the god Emperor and just as the iians have
[04:19:27] planned leato is immediately attracted to her her uncle Mali had once been Boon companion to the Lord leato he knew the god Emperor better than perhaps even mono the god Emperor finds both her
[04:19:40] physical Beauty and her truly pure personality to be intoxicating leato understands that the iians have uncovered his secret his vulnerability leato had known that they had been working on something he
[04:19:54] couldn't see it but he knew when something vanished from his preent view H Nori had been raised in a not chamber a device that the Ians had developed from the same technology that he used to
[04:20:06] record his journals a not chamber hid whatever was inside from prience Ki Nori had been bred specifically to appeal to the final remnants of humanity within leato he has become more and more alien
[04:20:20] with the passage of time he longed to feel again the iians hoped that they could use H Nori to tempt leato away from his golden path kui was merely a pawn and meant leato no harm consciously
[04:20:34] leato could not bring himself to dismiss hinori and he could not kill her the ixian plot had worked leato decides instead that she will be his bride the god Emperor is incapable of physical
[04:20:48] intimacy the sand vectors of his body reacted to even the slightest hints of moisture he tells Wei that she would be allowed to take a lover if she so chose she accepts the god Emperor's
[04:21:01] proposal we are myth Killers you a i Mano that is the dream we share I show you from a God's Olympian perch that government is a shared myth when the
[04:21:13] myth dies the government dies Leo's golden path if successful will lead to a new way of existing for humankind Leo knew that governments were only useful to the Govern as long as the
[04:21:27] government's inherent Tendencies towards tyranny were restrained I can imagine your inward travels Lord no you cannot I have seen peoples and planets in such numbers that they lose meaning even in
[04:21:39] imagination oh the Landscapes I have passed the calligraphy of alien roads glimpsed from space and imprinted upon my innermost sight the eroded sculpture of canyons and cliffs and galaxies has imprinted upon me the certain knowledge
[04:21:53] that I am Mo not you Lord certainly not you less than Mo I have seen people and their fruitless Societies in such repetitive posturings that their nonsense fills me with boredom do you
[04:22:07] hear I did not mean to anger you my lord Mano speaks meekly you do not anger me sometimes you irritate me that is the extent of it you cannot imagine what I have seen cffs and maids rakas and rajas
[04:22:21] and Bashar Kings and Emperors Primitives and presidents I have seen them all feudal Chieftains everyone everyone a little Pharaoh the gone Emperor understood that governments always trended towards increasingly despotic States
[04:22:36] humans naturally sought out tribal hierarchies fing an ancient demand for a system in which every individual knows his place leato believed that knowing one's place was valuable even if that place was temporary but to be held in
[04:22:50] place against your will was another thing entirely leato had imposed this Stillness upon the entire universe such was his tyranny but this was his lesson to all
[04:23:03] mankind Beware of the Liberties you offer up to your leaders even though you read these words after a passage of eons my tyranny shall not be
[04:23:15] forgotten my golden path assures this knowing my message I expect you to be exceedingly careful about the powers you delegate to any government mono had been the god Emperor's major Domo for the past 79
[04:23:30] years he was truly the god Emperor's creature mono somewhat resented Duncan Idaho because of the special connection they shared with leato their Mutual memories from the Dune days and before
[04:23:43] as I said before mono had once been a rebel just as his daughter ciona is now as a gift to Mono leato takes ciona out of Harm's Way by forcing her to join his fish speakers and soon he will test her
[04:23:57] as he once tested mono mono in his youth had been placed in a massive maze concealed beneath Leo's Citadel he was given only a bag of food and a vial of the deadly spice Essence the truthsayer
[04:24:11] drug which could unblock genetic memory it was the only liquid leato gave him Mano was a traes he knew he would be exposed to the inter multitude upon consumption of the drug and he feared
[04:24:23] this more than dying of thirst he knew however that he had no choice after wondering the maze for hours he finally consumes the drug he heard the ancestral voices and his preent eye was was open
[04:24:37] he saw what the god Emperor saw he saw what Paul at trodes had seen and ran from those many thousands of years ago he saw Humanity's Extinction and also the means by which it could be diverted
[04:24:50] the golden path Mano now understood after this he awoke knowing the way out of the Maze and knowing that he would serve the god Emperor to the end of his days and he served him Faithfully since that
[04:25:04] day man had been enlightened by the golden path he was terrified of the idea of the world without leato he would rather die than face such an existence the new Duncan however has begun to see
[04:25:17] Leo's rule as corruption as he has gotten to know the world around him he began to believe that Leo's rule of the empire was one of religious tyranny and oppression Idaho naturally rebelled against this Idaho is even more
[04:25:32] Disturbed upon witnessing the children of his predecessor as well as the Widow who Duncan notices has a striking resemblance to the lady Jessica the god Emperor has intended to breed Sia and Duncan and has forced them
[04:25:45] into situations where they must be together both CA and Duncan resent the god Emperor for trying to control them in this manner Sia is the key to hastening Duncan's disillusionment with the god Emperor giving him Insight on
[04:26:00] the true goings on in the worms Empire Duncan had been immediately attracted to the ixian Ambassador we norri upon seeing her but the god Emperor had commanded him to avoid her saying we is not for you when the god Emperor decided
[04:26:14] to wet hu Nori mono voiced his own apprehensions pointing out that this was obviously part of some ixian plot but leato is in fact vulnerable he loves wh only around her does his loneliness fade
[04:26:28] Duncan is revulsed by the thought of leato wedding wh he speaks of Frontiers and questions the Lord leato on whether he would truly be free to do what he wished and go where he wished leato tells him that he is free to go as he
[04:26:43] chooses I have given you my oath that is important to me it is still important I don't know what you're doing or why I can only say I don't like what's
[04:26:54] happening there I've said it leato sees Duncan as a child and thinks to himself that Duncan is both the oldest and youngest man in the universe Duncan disobeys the god imp however which angers him when the god Emperor speaks
[04:27:09] to Mono after his arrival back from the Festival City mono could sense the coming of the worm mono believed truly that there were two leato and the worm it was the worm that killed the worm who
[04:27:23] was God leato inhabited God leato demands that mono accelerate the plans for the wedding mono attempts to C the god Emperor by stating that norim merely feels sorry for Duncan but l knows that
[04:27:36] he is courting her he is clever with women mono exceedingly clever he sees into their souls and makes them do what he wants it has always been that way with the Duncans I did not know you had prohibited all meetings between them
[04:27:50] Lord mano's voice was almost strident he is more dangerous than any of the others leato said it is the fault of our times Lord the TXU do not have a successor for him ready to deliver and we need this
[04:28:04] one you you said it yourself Lord it is a paradox which I do not understand but you did say it how long until there could be a replacement at least a year Lord shall I inquire as to a specific
[04:28:17] date do it today he may hear about it Lord the previous one did I do not want it to happen this way mono I know Lord and I dare not speak of this to nor
[04:28:30] leato said the Duncan is not for her yet I cannot hurt her the last was almost a whale mono stood in odd silence can't you see this leato demanded mono help me
[04:28:45] hinori and Duncan have fallen for each other which upsets the god Emperor he does not wish to hurt her this makes him vulnerable mono then starts to see the signs of the coming of the worm the god
[04:28:58] Emperor's hands begin to Twitch and his eyes glaze over mono takes a step back feeling exposed knowing that a flick of the great body would kill him I must appeal to the human in him Mano brings
[04:29:11] up Leo's sister ganima they had been wed but not mates he asked leato if it would be possible for him to mate with weed Nori but the worm signs only intensified Leo's hands vibrated
[04:29:24] spasmodically in a very distant voice he tells Mano not to question him about possibilities mono can hear that leato is sinking further and further into that inner gate which only he could enter
[04:29:37] Mano slowly backed out of the room trembling ah that was the closest ever and the Paradox remained where did it Point what was the meaning of the god
[04:29:49] Emperor's odd and painful decisions what brought the worm who is God a thumping sounded from within Leo's AR a heavy beating against Stone Mano dared not open the door to investigate he pushed
[04:30:03] himself away from the surface which reflect at that Dreadful thumping and went down the stairs moving cautiously not drawing an easy breath until he reached the ground level and the fish speaker guard there is he Disturbed she
[04:30:17] asked looking up the stairs Mano nodded they both could hear the thumping quite plainly what disturbs him the guard asked he is God and we are mortal mono
[04:30:29] said Duncan has put them all in danger and Mano cannot help but resent him even more he wonders what can be done about H Nori Mano goes to Duncan and tells him of the god Emperor's wishes his relationship
[04:30:44] with h Nori cannot continue it only angers Duncan more Mano sees now that this Duncan is more Reckless than any of the others before him and insist that he must trust the god Emperor but the
[04:30:57] Duncan says aloud how can a god do evil things the fish speaker women in the room without a doubt heard this and would make their report to the Lord leato had it been any other man other than Duncan Idaho who spoke those words
[04:31:11] the women themselves would have eliminated him Duncan becomes paranoid and wonders what the god Emperor will do but in his Chambers he finds we Nori there she had been told to reject Duncan
[04:31:24] as Duncan looks at her he is reminded of the controlled movements of the lady Jessica and realizes that we Nori is Benny Jes trained the Benny jzr were indeed among her teachers though she is not a member of The
[04:31:38] Sisterhood H cannot deny her attraction to Duncan though the god Emperor forbids it she admits to Duncan that she was bred and trained for one purpose alone to woo the god Emperor she was designed
[04:31:51] to please and at trodes and Duncan had always truly been at trodes wh and Duncan make love then but afterward she tells him that they never will again be together in this way she tells him that she will tell the god emperor of what they have done
[04:32:06] she knows that leato will not harm her and he will not harm the Duncan for this would destroy her in turn who truly understands that leato needs her more than Duncan though Duncan argues he only
[04:32:18] resents leato even more finally leato and ciona meet he summons her to him she asks him if he is really a god she does not understand why her father Mano believes in him but he
[04:32:32] does not necessarily answer her she asked why he has done what he has done why he has chosen to become this monstrosity but he does not directly answer gradually as they spoke leato had
[04:32:46] been dimming the concealed lights of his ay moving his cart closer and closer to ciona now he shut off the lights leaving only the moon the front of his cart protruded onto the balcony his face
[04:32:59] about 2 m froma my father tells me she said that the older you get the slower your time goes is that what you told him testing my veracity he thought she is not a
[04:33:12] truth SGA then all things are relative but compared to the human time since this is true why it is involved in what I will become at the end time will stop
[04:33:25] for me and I will be Frozen like a pearl caught in ice my new bodies will scatter each with a pearl hidden within it she turned and looked away from him him peering out at the desert speaking
[04:33:38] without looking at him when I talk to you like this here in the darkness I can almost forget what you are when CA ask leato to turn on the lights she wonders why his face is not wrinkled he tells
[04:33:52] her that nothing about his human parts age in a normal way she wonders if he did this for long life but he assures her that he did not he tells her the truth about his metamorphosis that s she
[04:34:05] is a traes she could too be like him if there were other sand trout around the thought of it makes her shiver but she knows that it is the truth once again she asked why but he said that she will
[04:34:18] know in time leel tells CA of his secret the secret that she already knows he tells her of the companions that he has loved that have slipped away from him of her mother who slipped away long ago and her father who is slipping away now he
[04:34:33] is racked with emotion each time for many centuries this suffering was the only emotion he knew ciona sympathizes with the god Emperor but insist that this does not give him the right to
[04:34:47] govern and leato knew this was the root of her Rebellion by what right where is the Justice in my rule by imposing my rules upon them with the weight of fish speaker arms am I being fair to The
[04:35:01] evolutionary thrust of mankind as intended Leo's conversation witha leaves her wide open to her own doubts she still insists that she had not been convinced of anything by their meeting she asks what
[04:35:15] the purpose of it was he tells her that the purpose is to see if she was ready to be tested which obviously frightens her don't play innocent with me mono has told you and I tell you that you are
[04:35:29] ready she tried to swallow then what are I have sent for mano to return you to the C he said when we meet again we will really learn what you are made of when the god Emperor next speaks to mano he
[04:35:42] asks how soon the clu can provide a replacement Duncan Mano tells him that the clu report problems Mano believes that the worm May soon approach the god Emperor grows increasingly agitated with
[04:35:55] the behavior of the current Duncan his subversion was occurring far more quickly than anticipated Mano was aware of the many deaths that had occurred in the crypts in which they resided he wonders judging by the way the god Emperor is speaking if it is his time to
[04:36:10] die failure to respond to the god Emperor correctly he believed would mean his death abruptly Leo's voice filled the chamber with a rumbling baritone and ancient voice which spoke across the
[04:36:23] centuries you are servants unto Gods Not servants unto servants Mano rung his hands out and cried I serve you Lord Mano Mano his voice lowed and resonant a million wrongs cannot give rise to one
[04:36:38] right the right is known because it endures Mano could only stand in trembling silence I had intended we to mate with you Mano leato said now it is too late the words took a moment
[04:36:51] penetrating mano's Consciousness he felt that their meaning was out of any known context we who was we oh yes the god Emperor ixian bride to be mate with me

[04:38:12] planet oracus the isolated desert climate was maintained by ixian devices leato could move swiftly in his own territory it was his domain they look out onto the desert together this was
[04:38:25] how it was he said he knew that there was something in the desert that spoke to the Eternal Soul of those who possessed fan blood he tells the to climb upon his back I want you to taste the way our people once move proudly

[04:40:29] perfectly normal for adolescent females as well as males to have feelings of physical attraction to toward members of their own sex most of them will grow out of it it should be stamped out but it's part of our heritage Idaho insists that
[04:40:44] this rampant homosexuality must be suppressed but wiser mono understood that an attempt to suppress such a thing only increases its power Idaho shifts the conversation to the topic of ciona and attempts to shame mono for allowing
[04:40:58] the worm to test her knowing that she may never return mono wonders to himself why he puts up with such a foolish person as Duncan Idaho and he responds that he had no choice he insists to
[04:41:10] Duncan Idaho that he must mature I am not some damn child you can Duncan it was the loudest sound Idaho had ever heard from the mild mannered mono surprise stayed Idaho's hand while mono

[04:43:00] off and Shrugged Idaho inhaled two deep breaths you're crazy all of you you say your daughter may be dying and yet you fool mono snapped have you any idea how your petty concerns appear to me your
[04:43:14] stupid questions and your selfish he broke off shaking his head I make allowances because you have certain problems Idaho said but if you allowances you make allowances mono took
[04:43:28] a trembling breath it was too much Idaho spoke stiffly I can forgive you for you you Brattle about sex and forgiving and pain and you think you and we Nori leave

[04:44:08] things have been done to the Lord leato for no better reason than the cruelty you defend him you I know him best he uses you to what ends you tell me he is
[04:44:20] our best hope to perpetuate perverts do not perpetuate mono spoke in a soothing tone but his words shook Idaho I will tell you this only once homosexuals have been among the best
[04:44:34] Warriors in our history the Berserkers of Last Resort they were among our best priest and priestesses celibacy was no accident in religions mono attempts to guide Duncan out of his backward viewpoint but Duncan resists at every
[04:44:49] turn constantly questing for something else to hate about Leo's Empire you suggested that he uses me mono said I permit this because I know the price that he pays is much greater than what
[04:45:02] he demands of me even your daughter he holds back nothing why should I oh I think you understand this about the atraes the Duncans are always good at
[04:45:14] that the Duncans damn you I won't be you just haven't the guts to pay the price he's asking mono said in one blurred motion Idaho whipped his knife from its sheath and lunged at mono as fast as he
[04:45:28] moved mono moved faster s stepping tripping Idaho and propelling him face to down on the floor Idaho scrambled forward rolled and started to LEAP to his feet then hesitated realizing that he had actually tried to attack and a
[04:45:42] traes mono was a traes shock held Idaho immobile mono stood unmoving looking down at him there was an odd look of sadness on the major Doo's face if you are going to kill me Duncan you'd best
[04:45:57] do it in the back by stealth mono said you might succeed that way Idaho levered him self to one knee put a foot flat on the floor but remained there still clutching his knife mono had moved so
[04:46:11] quickly and with such Grace so so casually Idaho cleared his throat how did you he has been breeding us for a long time Duncan strengthening many things in us he has bred us for speed
[04:46:25] for intelligence for self-restraint for sensitivity you're you're just an older model the tension that had been building between Duncan and mono finally comes to a peak in this scene when Duncan Idaho
[04:46:39] attacks Mano but then is met with the shock of mono's incredible agility and speed Duncan Idaho is nothing compared to thousands of years of precise genetic honing after this Idaho's self-esteem drops he begins to see himself as
[04:46:54] Obsolete and wonders if he should kill himself he only resents leato even more mano's words echoed in his mind you're just an older model as leato and ciona moved through the desert they spoke
[04:47:08] sporadically he told her of fan history and in the afternoon she crept close to him for the warmth his body generated in excess leato noticed that CA was not utilizing the face flap in her still
[04:47:21] suit this would cause the body to lose moisture much faster but he could not intervene it was part of the test as their time in the desert continues Sia grows weaker she leaned against him once
[04:47:35] and heard the rumbling of his insides leato saw that she was cold he allowed her to curl up inside a depression at the bottom of his first segment in order to keep warm leato knew that he had to resist feeling pity for Sia since
[04:47:49] knowing we Nori his human emotions had become more Amplified than they had been in centuries Sia itched closer to death as time went on leato prepared himself for her failure and considered her replacement
[04:48:04] once leato had made callous decisions with ease but as he grew increasingly inhuman he found himself to be consumed with increasingly more human concerns it was only on the third day
[04:48:19] that CA remembered mano's explanation of the still suit by this point however Sia had lost a considerable amount of water 5 days in leato can sense ca's desperation and knows that she will soon
[04:48:33] reach a a moment of Crisis he tells her that there are three nights until they find water she knows that she will not make it once again she asked why he does what he does he tells her truthfully
[04:48:48] that he has a need to save the threads of all humankind he says that without him by this point in history all of human kind would already be extinct and the path to
[04:49:01] that Extinction would have been more hideous than she could have ever possibly imagined he assures her that the two of them are in fact interdependent and when she asked what
[04:49:12] need he has of her he responds by saying this you are the golden path he said me it was barely a whisper you've read those journals you stole from me he said
[04:49:26] I am in them but where are you look at what I have created Sia and you you can create nothing except yourself words more tricky words I do not suffer from
[04:49:40] being worshiped ciona I suffer from never being appreciated perhaps no I dare not hope for you what's the purpose of those journals and ixian machine records them
[04:49:53] they are to be found on a far away day they will make people think an IED machine you defy the Jihad there is a lesson in that too what do such machines
[04:50:05] really do they increase the number of things we can do without thinking things we do without thinking there's the real danger look at how long you walked across this desert without thinking
[04:50:19] about your face mask you could have warned me and increased your dependency ciona still does not yet understand what leato means in insisting that she is the golden path but she is shocked by his
[04:50:32] admission to Defying the butler Arian Jihad he tells her that it is not the machines that are the danger but the thoughtless things that humans can do using those machines in truth leato
[04:50:45] fears the iians knowing that they can invent catastrophe leato knew that all of history was a race between invention and catastrophe Sia asked what she must do
[04:50:57] for him in order to save her he tells her that she must undergo the spice agony and she knows what the spice will do to her considering her a trade's blood these curled flaps beside my face
[04:51:12] he said tease one of them gently with a finger and it will give up drops of moisture heavily laced with the spice Essence CA leaned towards him and licked the drops off his flap and resealed the still suit mask over her eyes she
[04:51:26] refitted herself into Leo's front segment she jerked abruptly and be to tremble like a small creature dying he knew this experience but could not change the smallest part of it no
[04:51:39] ancestral presences would remain in her Consciousness but she would carry with her forever afterward the clear sights and sounds and smells the seeking machines would be there the smell of
[04:51:53] blood and entrails the cowering humans in their Burrows aware that they could not Escape while all the time the mechanical movement appr approached
[04:52:04] nearer and nearer and nearer louder and louder leato could feel ca's life ebbing he could feel the Vitality draining out of her slipping away she was falling
[04:52:18] into darkness leato rocked her gently like a baby in a cradle eventually the trembling subsided Sia awoke late afternoon and did not speak for an hour turning her back on lato she had seen
[04:52:33] everything you could have saved my friends in the forest she accused you too could have saved them she clenched her fist and pressed them against her temples while she glared at him but you know
[04:52:47] everything ciona did I have to learn it that way she whispered he remained silent forcing her to answer the question for herself she had to be made to recognize that his primary
[04:53:00] Consciousness worked in a freman way and that like the terrible Machines of that apocalyptic Vision the Predator could follow any creature who left tracks the
[04:53:12] golden path she whispered I can feel it then glaring at him it's so cruel survival has always been cruel they couldn't hide she whispered then loud
[04:53:26] what have you done to me you tried to be a Freeman Rebel he said Freeman had an almost incredible ability to read signs on the desert they could even read the faint tracery of windblown tracks in
[04:53:39] sand leato Muses about what they had seen in the vision the machines that would hunt and kill any living creature who left tracks Sia and her descendants
[04:53:50] would leave no tracks Sia saw the golden path saw what it prevented she saw the thing that humans could not hide from the thing that would hunt and kill every living thing in the universe
[04:54:04] ciona still hates leato however and she has realized that he cannot find her in his preent view he tells her that she hates the Predator's necessary cruelty he tells her that she must breed and
[04:54:17] preserve her precious genes as leato spoke a sudden bout of rain covered them for an instant a malfunction of his ixian weather machines ciona did not immediately notice the effect it had on
[04:54:30] leato he curled into a ball of agony felt as though he was being ripped apart blue smoke drifted from his body as he involuntarily be to produce true spice Essence not the altered form that he had
[04:54:43] used to test ciona which did not allow her to retain genetic memory CA realizes that the water hurts him he tells her about the relationship of sand trout to water in that moment leato could see
[04:54:56] that there was still rebellion in her eyes she could not deny the reality of his golden path but in her mind his cruelties could not be forgiven he knows what CA is thinking
[04:55:09] but will do nothing against her she must live after their return from the desert leato makes Sia a guard Commander still she plots his destruction and now Duncan
[04:55:22] Idaho plots along with her and now that Sia knows the secret of the god Emperor's demise ring him with water she is certain that she can kill him see IA says that she will not break her oath
[04:55:36] that she will command his fish speakers but it will not be as he wishes or so she thought Sia was a traes and she opposed the god Emperor so Duncan was justified leato was no true Human After
[04:55:51] All ciona was a real atres together they plot the murder of the god Emperor nla who has sworn to obey ciona in all things has no choice but to help knowing that her God will
[04:56:05] perform a miracle the god Emperor grows increasingly agitated as his wedding draws nearer only H Nori seems to calm
[04:56:15] him I have no inner eye no inner voices she said but I have seen my Lord leato whose soul I love and I know the only thing that you truly
[04:56:29] understand he broke from her gaze fearful of what she might say the trembling of his hands could be felt all through his front segment love that is
[04:56:41] what you understand she said love and that is all of it his hand stopped trembling a tear rolled down each of his cheeks when the tears touched his cowl
[04:56:53] wisp of blue smoke erupted he sensed the burning and was thankful for the pain the iians had intended for leato to love we but not for her to love him that was beyond their planning leato sheds a tear
[04:57:09] in this scene a thing which he had previously believed was impossible leato was more inhuman than he had ever been before we offered him an opportunity to restore his Humanity for one final
[04:57:22] fleeting moment as the Royal cart carrying the god Emperor and wi Nori crosses the bridge leading into tuano Village Mano heard the L gun it was who had fired
[04:57:34] from The Cliffs at the command of ciona Mano felt the bridge Shake underneath him he saw the god Emperor's cart lean over the edge of the bridge we norri fell silently to her death her last
[04:57:46] words echoed in Leo's mind I shall go on ahead love a deep rumbling groan had come from Leo then and in that moment another La gun blast hit directly striking the Royal cart
[04:58:00] suspensors as Mano fell he reaches a final point of awareness the clarity of mind that one experiences before death as he plunges to his death he turns to
[04:58:12] see leato fall from the Royal cart he shouted leato see ANUK I believe he fell freely then in the Ecstasy of awareness as leato fell toward the river
[04:58:26] beneath he thought to himself now you will learn it is time for Humanity to know his final lesson leato fell into pure Agony he marveled that he could remain conscious through such incredible
[04:58:40] pain he could feel himself separating as the sand trout of his body detached from him and went into the water they would eventually emerge as a new breed of worms Spice in the future will be more
[04:58:55] difficult to harvest for each worm would have a piece of the god Emperor inside a fragmentation of his whole self puffs of blue smoke and Mist rise all around him as his body produces the
[04:59:08] spice Essence somehow he pulls himself from the water he recognizes the place then just down the barrier wall was the remains of sich tabour where he had hidden his immense horde of spice he
[04:59:22] turned in the confinement of the cave and saw a rope dangling at the entrance a figure slid down the Rope he recognized nla she dropped to the rocks and crouched there staring into the Shadows at him the flame which was Leo's
[04:59:36] Vision parted to reveal another figure dropping from the Rope Sia she and Nila scrambled toward him in a rattle of rocks and stopped peering at him a third figure dropped off the Rope Idaho he
[04:59:49] moved with a frantic rage hurling himself at nla screaming why' you kill her you weren't supposed to kill we nla sent him spraing with a casual almost indifferent sweep of her left arm she scrambled up closer to to the Rocks un
[05:00:03] stopped on all fours to peer at leato Lord you live Idaho was right behind her snatching the lay gun from her holster nla turned astonished as he leveled the weapon and pulled the trigger the
[05:00:16] burning started at the top of nla's head it split her the pieces slumping apart ciona and Duncan gazed upon leato the sand trout skin had fled into the water he was pocked with silia holes from
[05:00:29] where they had left he was a disgusting sludge look at what you've done to poor Duncan leato said he'll find other loves how callous she sounded an echo of his own
[05:00:42] angry youth you do not know what love is he said what have you ever given he could only ring his hands then those travesties which once had been his hands
[05:00:54] Gods below what I've given she sled closer and reached toward him then Drew back I am re ITA look upon me I exist you can touch me if you dare reach out
[05:01:09] your hand do it slowly she reached toward what had been his front segment the place where she had slept in the serer her hand was touched with blue when she withdrew it you have touched me
[05:01:21] and felt my body he said is that not strange Beyond any other thing in this universe she started to turn away no don't turn away from me look at what you have wrought ciona how is it that you
[05:01:35] can touch me but you cannot touch yourself she Whirled away from him there is the difference between us he said you are God embodied you walk around with the greatest Miracle of this universe
[05:01:49] yet you refuse to touch or see or feel or believe in it as leato died he could sense his ixian devices working recording his thoughts on rulian
[05:02:01] crystals lat till thinks to his journals remember what I did remember me I will be innocent again the journals will be his record of the truth the version
[05:02:14] undistorted by history he says to Duncan let them scatter let them run and hide anywhere they want in any Universe they choose referencing the great scattering of mankind that will occur following his
[05:02:28] death he tells Duncan that the fish speakers will choose to follow his him over ciona he asks Duncan to be kind to her he tells him that CA is more than a traes and that she carries the seed of
[05:02:42] the survival of all humans leato tells CA and Duncan where his spice horde is hidden Duncan knows the place one final time Duncan asked why why has leato done
[05:02:54] any of this leato answers my gift ler said nobody will find the descendant OFA the Oracle cannot see her what they
[05:03:08] spoke in unison leaning close to hear his fading voice I give you a new kind of time without parallels he said it will always diverge there will be no
[05:03:22] concurrent points on its curves I give you the golden path that is my gift never again will you have the kind of concurrence that once you

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
05:03:35] had leato dies as his Consciousness is fragmented and the gross Hulk that was his body disintegrates into puddles of Blue Mist Sia tells Duncan that though
[05:03:47] she is different she is still what Lea was she walked amongst her inner lives what was unseen and could only Glimpse blurred shapes of her ancestral past
[05:04:00] enough to light the golden path [Music] you know the myth of the great spice horde yes I know about that story too a
[05:04:13] major Domo brought it to me one day to amuse me the story says there is a horde of mange a gigantic horde big as a great Mountain The Horde is concealed in the
[05:04:27] depths of a distant planet it is not oracus that planet it is not Dune the spice was hidden there long ago even before the first Empire and the
[05:04:40] spacing Guild the story says that Paul muad went there and lives yet beside the horde kept Alive by it waiting the major Domo did not
[05:04:54] understand why the story Disturbed me the story of the great spice horde may have Disturbed the god Emperor for several reasons in some sense Paul did live on kept
[05:05:06] Alive by a giant spice horde muad still lived within the hordes of Leo's mind eternally observing the story may also disturb leato because it represents the very thing he was trying to destroy the
[05:05:21] story indicated that humankind still longed for their Messiah their savior who would solve their problems and restore the empire to the way it once was this mentality was incompatible with
[05:05:33] the golden path but what is the golden path exactly it starts with one basic idea if one individual could rule over all mankind then one threat could destroy it this is the essential lesson
[05:05:47] that he had to teach mankind centralized leaders must be avoided at all cost he became the greatest desperate of all time so that humans would always remember and never return to their past
[05:06:01] behaviors there is more leato saw the death of all humankind if he did not intervene in the stolen journals leato Muses to himself and who knows what the
[05:06:12] ixian might manufacture or invent who knows I certainly don't not all of it leato understood that once the magic of Technology was Unleashed that it could never be put back in the Box the iians
[05:06:28] had tried to hide a colony Beyond his vision it had failed he told tolerated the iians though he called them criminals of science the iians operated in the Terra incognit of creative invention which had been outlawed by the
[05:06:41] butlerian Jihad they made their devices in the image of the Mind the very thing which had ignited the jihad's destruction and Slaughter that was what they did on I and leato could only let them continue but leato knew that he
[05:06:55] would not have to worry as long as he succeeded in his breeding program once he knew that CA was the one he no longer feared what the iians would create his final words to Duncan and CA are do not
[05:07:08] fear the Ians they can make the machines but they can no longer make arafel I know I was there arafel is the cloud darkness of
[05:07:23] holy judgment this is a Biblical reference Psalm 972 clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and Justice are the habitation of his throne essentially
[05:07:37] leato was saying that though the iians will continue to invent they will never create God never create a machine that will be the final judge of all humankind ciona solved this problem
[05:07:51] whatever threat that leato foresaw would have used prience to seek out and destroy all of mankind ca's genes which spread throughout all the univers during the scattering would prevent this by
[05:08:05] forcing mankind to stagnate confined to their individual planets for thousands of years leato created a restlessness within them when they were free from his tyranny they scattered throughout the
[05:08:17] Universe the ixian threat would never be able to find all humans no one individual could ever again Glimpse the whole of humanity no machine can do as we do the
[05:08:32] the descendants of Duncan Idaho and ciona have done how many universes have we populated none can guess no one person will ever know does the church
[05:08:44] fear the occasional profit we know that Visionaries cannot see us nor predict our decisions no death can find all of humankind must we of the minority join
[05:08:58] our fellows of the scattering before we can be heard must we leave the original core of humankind ignorant and uninformed if the majority drives us out
[05:09:10] you know we never again can be found we do not want to leave we are held here by those pearls in the sand we are fascinated by the church's use of the Pearl as the son of understanding surely
[05:09:25] no reasoning human can escape the journal's revelations in this regard the admittedly fugitive but but vital uses of archaeology must have their day just as the Primitive machine which leato
[05:09:38] concealed his journals can only teach us about the evolution of our machines just so that ancient awareness must be allowed to speak to us it would be a crime against both historical accuracy
[05:09:52] and science for us to abandon our attempts at communication with those Pearls of awareness which the journals have located is leato thei lost in his endless dream or could he be reawakened
[05:10:06] to our times brought to full Consciousness as a storehouse of historical accuracy how can holy church fear this Truth for the minority we have no doubt
[05:10:19] that historians must listen to that voice from our many Beginnings if it is only the journals we must listen we must listen across at least as many years into our future as those journals lay
[05:10:34] hidden in our past we will not try to predict the discoveries yet to be made within those pages we say only that they must be made how can we turn our backs on our most
[05:10:49] important inheritance as the poet Lon bramus said we are the Fountain of surprises I hope you all have enjoyed episode episode five of my Ultimate

[05:12:29] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Heretics of Dune is the fifth novel in
[05:12:55] Frank Herbert's original Dune series the book follows the minations of the Benny jzer sister Ood as they encounter new powers within the old Empire The Lost Ones returning out of the great
[05:13:08] scattering after the death of the worm God Emperor approximately 1500 years ago the fish speakers his female military force had taken control of the god Emperor's enormous wealth of spice they
[05:13:23] had squandered that tremendous wealth in Petty squabbles and foolish actions no single event significant enough to be recorded by history eventually the TAC Su that Fringe world at the edge of the
[05:13:37] Empire who had produced countless goulas for the god Emperor discovered a way to produce spice mange from within their Axel tanks this pushed the fish speakers into an alliance with the iians control
[05:13:51] of oracus passed to the priesthood who led a new religion formed from the remnants of Leo's old design they worshiped the god of the desert Shai halud each worm now containing a piece
[05:14:05] of the god Emperor's Consciousness still the Benny jeser remained one of the most powerful forces in the Empire superior to the modern fish Beaker Council which had inherited
[05:14:18] the heart of the old atres Empire they were Superior to CH by far and equal to the spacing Guild though the Guild's Monopoly on space travel had long been broken by The iians Who had invented
[05:14:31] technology which allowed vessels to travel without the use of a guild Navigator the Benny JZ had always seen themselves as permanent revolutionaries it was a revolution that had been dampened only in the time of
[05:14:45] the Tyrant leato II dampened but not diverted or stopped since the time of the god Emperor the Benny JZ Sisterhood had purchased 12 Duncan Idaho golas from the T laxu up until this point each one had
[05:15:01] been a assassinated they suspected by the TXU themselves many in The Sisterhood feared this goola project the Mother Superior toza knows there are Heretics among them the word heretic
[05:15:15] here referred to a private joke within The Sisterhood they were supposed to follow the orders of the Mother Superior always with absolute devotion the sisters did do this except when they
[05:15:29] disagreed the most recent Duncan idah hoola was sent to the planet Gamu to be trained Gamu had once been known as gidi Prime until the name was changed by gurnie HCK the Benny jzr keep on Gamu
[05:15:43] was watched over by the Reverend mother schwang Yu schwang Yu was a heretic the older woman like some others in The Sisterhood believed the gool of project to be ultimately dangerous to the Ben
[05:15:56] jzer those in her Camp of thought believed that there was a chance that by medal with the forces set in motion by the Tyrant they could make the same mistake as before losing control of a
[05:16:09] quizat hatak to meddle with the worm bound remnants of the Tyrant that was dangerous in the extreme Tazza does not trust schwang Yu with the goola she knows that schwang Yu is in active
[05:16:23] opposition to the goola project and has underlying violent motives against Duncan when the goola was six his military trans on Gamu began his instruction was given over to the hands
[05:16:35] of the Bashar miles tag he was an atraes descendant born of a bzr reverend mother miles Tag's mother had also been a heretic giving tag secret knowledge he was not meant to possess this goola
[05:16:50] project was extremely important to Mother Superior Tazza she had summoned miles TG out of retirement and as a man who had served The Sisterhood his entire
[05:17:00] life he could not deny her except for his age 296 standard years miles tag was the spitting image of the original Duke leato this of course was part of the
[05:17:14] Benz design Tazza intended to use him to eventually awaken the goa's past memories as hate had done in the book Dune Messiah this new Duncan goola had been
[05:17:28] altered by the tayu his reflexes and nerves modernized The Sisterhood did not deny the possibility that the Tay laxu may have changed him in other ways as well still
[05:17:41] the Ben jzr gave him the most careful pranab Bindu training at all stages when Duncan is around 10 years old Reverend mother Lucilla an imprinter is sent to train him at the keep on Gamu
[05:17:55] Lucilla was obedient to Tazza her task would be to teach Duncan Idaho love in all forms Lucilla was also of a trodes Descent of a particularly motherly
[05:18:08] line as a descendant of ciona she was immune to all forms of pressence she was young but had already produced three children for The Sisterhood when she first speaks with
[05:18:21] schang Yu on Gamu she can sense schang Yu's violent intent against the goola the Jessica Persona within her memories also can sense do Doom surely No One
[05:18:33] Believes this goola can become another quizat hatak Lucilla objected schang Yu merely Shrugged Lucilla held herself quite still thinking was it possible the
[05:18:46] goola could be transformed into a male version of a reverend mother could this Duncan Idaho learn to look inward were no Reverend mother dared on the planet rakus formerly known
[05:19:00] as a racus the priesthood has made a discovery a child of eight named Shana bro who has power over the great worms of the desert when her Village was attacked by a worm killing everyone she
[05:19:12] knew she encountered the creature discovering her strange gift rage and wild desperation began to fill Shana mindlessly she raced down the Dune toward shaian coming up behind the worm
[05:19:27] as it turned back through the dry place where it had entered the village without a thought she dashed along beside the tail scrambled onto it and ran forward along the great rided back at the hump
[05:19:40] behind its mouth she crouched and beat her fist against the unyielding surface the worm stopped the worm had brought Shiana out of the desert and to the city of keen
[05:19:53] once called arim the priesthood had seen her arrival worm riding had been outlawed by the priesthood but Shana did not use maker hooks as did the freman of old the worm carried her of its own
[05:20:08] valtion some of the priests called Shiana the child of shi halud some believed she should be punished for mounting shy halud all her life Shana had been taught to despise these priests
[05:20:22] and why shouldn't she they were the oppressive dictators of her planet for days the priest argued over the fate of sh and finally they decided to test her
[05:20:34] normally this test would be an execution in Disguise those who displeased the priesthood would be dropped into the desert a thumper would be placed and a worm summoned they would meet the
[05:20:47] Judgment of God two worms came for Shana during the test as the priest watched from thopter above her go ahead eat me that's what they want the priest overhead could not hear her words but
[05:21:03] the gesture was visible and they could see that she was talking to the two worms of God the finger pointing up at them did not bode well the worms did not move Shana lowered her hand you killed
[05:21:17] my mother and father and all my friends she accused she took a step forward and shook a fist at them the worms retreated keeping their distance if you don't want me go back where you came from
[05:21:32] she waved them away toward the desert obediently they backed farther and turned in unison Shana's power over the great worms could no longer be doubted by anyone she is brought to the Temple of
[05:21:46] the priesthood where she lives like royalty for six years as the priest study her and her conversations with her father the god of the desert the high priest tuck grows fond of the child and
[05:21:59] even gives up his own bed chamber to her her every whim is saded any request no matter how difficult must be fulfilled for the holy Child the people of arus eventually begin to worship Shiana
[05:22:13] seeing her as a woman of the people all the while the Benny jzr have had their spies keeping a close watch on Shiana they have plans for her leato II himself had predicted the coming of this
[05:22:28] child there is a female child named Shana brug on rakus Shong Yu said she can control the giant worms Lucilla concealed her alertness giant worms not
[05:22:42] Shai hude not Shai tan giant worms the sand Rider predicted by the Tyrant had appeared at last the Mother Superior to razza has commanded Reverend mother Dar
[05:22:55] odr to go to rakus to prepare Shiana for what must come OD was also anatra descendant strikingly similar in appearance to her cousin Lucilla alra
[05:23:08] was more similar in age to Tazza however the two of them had bonded at a young age while at the many jeser schools out of necessity odra was hidden as a child her mother had made the mistake of being
[05:23:23] recognized while breeding and oade was kept with a man and woman who acted as her true parents until one day The Sisterhood came for her the memory of that day still haunted
[05:23:36] odra when the Reverend mothers came the Foster mother had not fought the removal of her child two Reverend mothers came with a contingent of male and female
[05:23:48] Proctors afterward odra was a long time understanding the significance of that wrenching moment the woman had known in her heart that the day of parting would come only a matter of time still as the
[05:24:03] days became years almost six standard of years the woman had dared to Hope then the Reverend mothers came with their Burly attendance they had merely been
[05:24:16] waiting until it was safe until they were sure no Hunters knew this was a b jzd planned at trod cion odr saw a great deal of money passed to the Foster mother the woman threw the money on on
[05:24:30] the floor but no voice was raised in objection the adult in the scene knew where the power lay calling up those compressed emotions odrade could still see the woman take herself to a straight
[05:24:44] back chair beside the window onto the street there to hug herself and rock back and forth back and forth not a sound from her the Reverend mothers used voice and their considerable WS plus the
[05:25:00] smoke of drugging herbs and their overpowering presence to lure odrade into their waiting ground car it will be just for a little while your real mother sent us odr sensed the lies but
[05:25:14] curiosity compelled my real mother her last view of the woman who had been her only known female parent was of that figure at the window rocking back and forth a look of
[05:25:27] misery on her face arms wrapped around herself ALR was taught later by The Sisterhood to remember that woman's pain it was her love for odra that caused her
[05:25:41] that misery The Sisterhood understood that love was one of the most dangerous forces in the universe and was best avoided thousands of years ago the lady Jessica's love for Duke leato had led to
[05:25:54] 4,000 years of subjugation under the Tyrant odr decided early on that she must not love this child Shana love would weaken
[05:26:06] her odra possessed the atra's wild Talent toan knew prience prience made the Mother Superior uncomfortable two of O's 19 Offspring produced for The Sisterhood had been
[05:26:21] quietly put to death they had been Abominations pre-born like the Tyrant and his sister ganima had been as muad sister Aaliyah had
[05:26:32] been on Gamu Duncan now 15 is nearing the appropriate age for lucilla's final imprint sexual imprint throughout his years on Gamu he had been given access
[05:26:46] to all the knowledge of The Sisterhood only knowledge of the Arcana was forbidden to him when he had learned of the god Emperor he had wondered what had driven a man to do such a thing he wishes that he could have served the God
[05:27:00] emperor in his time Duncan had grown to hate the Reverend mother schwang Yu he could sense her lies and manipulation he resented The Sisterhood now but loved Lucilla just as the Mother Superior to
[05:27:16] razza had intended one day as Duncan is training a tacu face dancer disguised as miles tag attacks Duncan and Lucilla after defeating the face dancer Bashar minat
[05:27:30] mous T quickly discerns that schwang Yu must be involved in the attack they are no longer safe at the Benz keep on Gamu the three of them flee Into the Wilderness along with the bashar's
[05:27:43] longtime trusted Aid partron a native of Gamu partron leaves them to create a diversion and is killed by schwang Yu partron however had given miles tag directions to a secret place he had
[05:27:57] discovered many years ago as a Young Man an ancient Haron and no Globe there they could hide from those who would seek them out for four nights T leads them through the forest of Gamu knowing that
[05:28:11] Shang Yu would not expect them to walk he must do the unexpected as the Mother Superior Tazza had commanded according to he and parran's plan everything would indicate that they went through the
[05:28:24] Wilderness and escape the planet on a no ship the ancient no Globe they arrived at was still functioning there was water and food miles knows that he must protect the goola he comes to the
[05:28:39] decision that he will awaken the gool's memories before Lucilla can complete the final imprint upon him this was the only way according to his minat projections that Duncan's safety and Sanity would
[05:28:52] remain intact T knows it will be no easy thing to thwart a full Reverend mother on rakus the temple is attacked and Shana is nearly killed by a hunter Seeker the Benny jzr spy kapuna dies
[05:29:07] saving the now 14-year-old girl the use of Shiga wire during the attack indicated ixian involvement and The Sisterhood intended to punish The Guild the TXU and the iians for their
[05:29:20] respective roles in the attack Shana is taken into A's care when odrade becomes aware of the fact that the high priest's men are spying she has has them killed swiftly an agreement is made and it is
[05:29:34] decided that Shana will be brought to a place removed from the bny jzr keep on rakus and from the priest's Temple they take Shana to a place in the city of keen the place was once a fish speaker
[05:29:47] Center in the days of the god Emperor it was a comfortable building cooled by ixian Machinery odrade allowed the priest to have representatives in the building but Reverend mothers walked the Halls and the priest would not intrude
[05:30:01] where o did not allow and Shana would meet them only as she allowed Shana takes to odrade immediately sensing her power eager for all that she can learn from the Reverend mother we have been a long time waiting
[05:30:16] for you odrade said we will not give those fools another opportunity to lose you the Society of the BX is divided into two classes face dancers and the
[05:30:29] Masters no no one from offworld had ever reported seeing a TXU female face dancers were supposedly sterile mules submissive to their masters in this time
[05:30:41] Saku have developed a new kind of face dancer they were almost undetectable they could absorb the memories as well as the form and Persona of a person they had already placed some of these new
[05:30:54] face dancers within the ranks of the iians and the fish speakers the TXU were now the only secure source of spice mange for the guild now that they could produce it in their Axel tanks for every
[05:31:07] milligram of spice harvested on rakus the B tacx produced tons Waf was the master of Masters he had been brought back countless times since before the
[05:31:20] time of Paul L trodes the tacu had maintained the myth of their own incompetence and malevolence the Empire had named them dirty Tac we are the people of the yist he had

05:31:45] these Millenia with only one purpose even the Ben jerit belief the tacu held a great belief based on zins unism and Sufism they were extremely Pious and
[05:31:58] extraordinarily xen phobic no Outsider or paenda as they called them was allowed on the planet they belied that leato II had not been God but the
[05:32:10] prophet of God WF meets with an honored mree aboard a no ship descendants of TXU from the scattering have warned him that these matr born out of the scattering
[05:32:22] had the powers of the Benes witches and worse the orange-eyed honored MRE demanded tot total subservience of the clay laxu using concealed weapons Waf kills the matre and she and her
[05:32:37] companions are replaced with face dancers he decides that the no ship must disappear there can be no evidence that the ship ever made it to TX the retribution of the matr could be
[05:32:51] great after some time inside the harona note chamber on Gamu miles tag decides that it is time to awaken the gool's memories as the Mother Superior had commanded the young Duncan was eager to
[05:33:06] know more about his past life 8 Days had gone by in the no Globe Duncan reacts negatively to the haran decor of the place but does not understand why he hated everything about the place tag was
[05:33:21] attempting to keep Duncan from being alone with Lucilla which Duncan noticed Lucilla wonders if the Tyrant knew through pressence that they would one day need this place when they had first
[05:33:35] entered the no Globe they found 21 skeletons the ones who had built this place killed by the har conans to preserve the secrets T tells Duncan that he has been
[05:33:47] preparing him for the intense pain necessary to restore his memories Duncan greatly desires to gain past memories but it was a thing he also feared he had discovered that he was a goola years ago
[05:34:01] at the B jert keep on Gamu the library provided the child with the most basic details goas humans grown from aadab cells in PLU Axel tanks Axel tanks a
[05:34:16] tacu device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a Cav describe agola he demanded innocent flesh devoid of its original memories see Axel tanks Duncan had learned to
[05:34:30] read the silences the blank places in what the people of the keep revealed to him Revelation swept over him he knew only tin and he
[05:34:42] knew I am a Goa late afternoon in the library all of the esoteric Machinery around him faded into a sensory background and a 10-year-old sat silently before a scanner hugging the
[05:34:57] knowledge to himself I am a goola t knew that he must create mental and physical Agony within Duncan as instructed by The Sisterhood he finds
[05:35:11] what he must do to be distasteful which he tells Duncan the Benny jzr had told him the way T's right hand shot out in a swift Arc the open Palm cracked against
[05:35:22] Duncan's cheek how dare you disobey me left hand out another rocking slap how dare you you T experienced an initial moment of shock at the speed with which the young Duncan reacted to his attacks
[05:35:37] T continued to create deeper and deeper pay for Duncan each time making sure Duncan saw his face at the instant of greatest Agony finally Duncan called out
[05:35:49] damn you lato tag knew it was done Duncan's mind is flooded with new awareness he even remembers his own death on arus his gaze remained on T did I buy Paul
[05:36:03] enough time to escape answer all of his questions truthfully he escaped now came the testing moment where had the TXU acquired the Idaho cells the sisterhood's test said they were
[05:36:17] original but suspicions remained the tacu had done something of their own to the ska his memories could be a valuable clue to that thing but the har conans Duncan said his memory from the key deep
[05:36:29] meshed oh yes oh yes a fierce laugh shook him he sent a roaring Victory Shout at the long dead Baron Vladimir Honan I paid you back Baron oh I did it to you for all the ones you destroyed
[05:36:46] miles tag tells Duncan that The Sisterhood has need of him Lucilla appears and sees that Duncan's memories are awakened tag knew that she had intended to imprint the goola before the Awakening of his memories she threatens
[05:37:00] miles tag saying that he better not have complicated her task of imprinting Duncan finally realizes what the imprinting is the Benny JZ intended to use him as a breeding stud he thought he
[05:37:13] would not allow it Duncan sensed his own violent thoughts towards Lucilla in his Mind's Eye he could see her covered in blood in that moment he understood that the TXU had done something to him they
[05:37:26] had altered him in some way the laku have done something to me something that has not yet been exposed dunan husk exactly what we feared it was Lucilla
[05:37:39] speaking from the doorway behind T she Advanced within two paces of Duncan I have been listening you two are very informative what have the telaku done to
[05:37:51] you she demanded Duncan spoke with a flippancy that he did not feel oh great imprinter if I knew I would tell you Lucilla knows that t has greatly
[05:38:03] complicated her task but she was no longer uncomfortable with the imprint of someone so young Duncan was no longer a boy but a man with adult memories later she attempts to complete the process but
[05:38:18] Duncan has made a judgment about The Sisterhood now he rejects her Lucilla if you touch me again without my permission I will try to kill you you I will try so
[05:38:31] hard that you will very likely have to kill me she recoiled he stared into her eyes I am not some damn stud for you witches is that what you think we want
[05:38:43] of you nobody has said what you want of me but your actions are obvious he stood poised on the balls of his feet the unawakened thing within him stirred and sent his pulse
[05:38:57] racing Lucilla knows that he is serious Lucilla is concerned that she may not be able to complete her task given to her by the Mother Superior teraza the benzar had delivered their
[05:39:10] standard messages to the guild I and the TXU for their roles in the attack on rakus you will be punished Mother Superior Tazza has decided to meet with
[05:39:22] the TXU Master WF aboard a guild vessel speculating Taza tells WF that he will not be able to deal with her the way he had dealt with the honored matr earlier Tazza claims that The Sisterhood had
[05:39:37] intercepted the missing MRE ship containing the face dancers it is a lie but he believes it he is shocked in his mind he curses her and all the damnable
[05:39:49] Ben jzr witches he recognized her power Waf did not try to delude himself about Taza this woman was far more dangerous than any honored matre if he killed Taza
[05:40:04] she would be replaced immediately by someone just as dangerous someone with every essential piece of information possessed by the present Mother Superior we find your new face dancers
[05:40:17] very interesting Tazza said WF grimaced involuntarily yes far more dangerous than the honored matr who were not yet even blaming the TXU for the loss of an
[05:40:29] entire noip Waf wishes that he could do away with Tazza and the entire Sisterhood sing potential violence in him Taza makes a guess she claims that she knows about his concealed weapons
[05:40:45] and his response demonstrated the truth of her guess W wonders again if telepathy was among the many powers of Benny jzr Reverend mothers she tells him that in exchange for Benny JZ ACC to
[05:40:59] their Axel tanks The Sisterhood will offer atraes breeding mothers though she would never give them true atraes only close mimics Tazza also discerns something critical from analyzing W's
[05:41:13] speech patterns she realizes that the TXU great belief was based in zenuni ISM and Sufism she knows now that the Ben JZ Sisterhood can manipulate the telaku
[05:41:25] through use of the missionar protectiva Taza offered offers WF an opportunity to experience the land of his Prophet inviting him to the bzr keep on rakus
[05:41:37] she will use him as bait in her scheme the significant fact is this no Ben clac female has ever been seen away from the protection of their core
[05:41:49] planets face dancer mules who simulate females do not count in this analysis they cannot be breeders the TXU sequester their females to keep them
[05:42:01] from our hands this is our primary deduction it must also be in the eggs that the TXU Masters concealed their most essential Secrets Benny jzr
[05:42:13] analysis archive number xox TM 99014 back on rakus odr awaits the arrival of the TXU Master WF she plans to take Shana along with WF into the
[05:42:27] desert when he arrived thanks to taza's new discovery regarding the roots of the TXU great belief she knew how to trap the telaku they would go deep into the Sands Beyond watchful
[05:42:40] eyes and she would manipulate him by use of the missionar protectiva she would force W to have a religious experience the chance to observe a TXU master in a
[05:42:52] religious setting would be invaluable once Waf arrives on rakus he attempts to spy upon odr with the help of high priest tuck as they discussed the holy Child Shiana Tuk had allowed the TXU
[05:43:06] Master to listen because he told him he would help get Shana back o tells tuck that because of the attack she had sent for Miles tag to reinforce raki and planetary defenses tuck believes the
[05:43:20] Benny jzr mean to wrestle control of the planet from him though Tuk had believed that o didn't know about the TXU listening she in fact fact was aware o demands the secret listener WF to be
[05:43:34] invited to sit with them WF was not supposed to bring face dancers to rakus but he brought two anyway ALR did not allow them into the room ALR noticed that WF concealed weapons beneath his
[05:43:47] sleeves she detected secret motives in Waf and comes to the realization that WF aimed to substitute a face dancer for high priest tuck my Lord tuck odre said
[05:43:59] this TXU intends to murder us both Waf attacks and odr breaks both of his arms into two quick motions but not before one of his darts fires killing tuck instantly Waf had never expected that
[05:44:15] there would be such speed and Power in her attacks the Two Face dancers burst into the room but wa commands them to leave when odr threatens to end him rendering him unconscious she sets his
[05:44:27] broken arms she tells him that her sisters have been listening and that he was now her Ally she uses what she had learned from Taza about the TXU zenuni beliefs and manipulates him into
[05:44:40] agreeing to an alliance making him feel as though no TXU plot remains hidden from The bzar Sisterhood a monopoly would force The Guild to buy more ixian navigation machines she said you would have the
[05:44:55] Guild in the jaws of your Crusher WF lifted his head to glare at her the movement sent Agony through his broken arms and he groaned despite the pain he studied odre through almost litted eyes
[05:45:08] did the witches really believe that was the extent of the clak Su plan he hardly dared hope the B JZ were so misled of course that was not your basic
[05:45:20] plan odr said wa's eyes snapped wide open she was reading his mind I am Dishonored he said when you saved my life you saved
[05:45:33] a useless thing he sank back odra inhaled a deep breath time to use the results of the chapter house analysis she leaned close to W and whispered in
[05:45:44] his ear the sharat needs you yet WF gasped odr sat back that gasp said it all analysis confirmed the Benny jzr had always used religion to manipulate in
[05:45:59] control the plaku master was no different from the rest the planet Chapter House had been occupied by the Benz Sisterhood for 1,400 years and even then they only
[05:46:13] thought of it as a temporary Planet it was a secret world but of course there was always the risk of accidental Discovery Taza on chapter house wonders where Miles T and the goola could be she
[05:46:28] had instructed the Bashar to act unpredictably but she had not expected this she has already asked the tacu to prepare a new goola just as a precaution in case the current one was dead Taza is
[05:46:42] conscious of the fact that the Benny JZ Sisterhood could be swallowed up by the honored MRE the MRE had not returned out of the scattering because of curiosity but out of dreams of conquest and they
[05:46:55] had begun their Conquest the Ben keep on Gamu had been attacked schwang Yu had been killed but not before she left a message to her sisters Swang Yu left you a message that only we might read and
[05:47:11] the we marks on the furniture yes Mother Superior and then she knew she would be attacked and had time to leave a message I saw your earlier report on the devastation of the attack it was quick and totally
[05:47:25] overpowering the attackers did not try to take captives what did she say  the Ben jeser referred to the matr as such for a simple reason they
[05:47:38] believed that the mrr made a mockery of The Sisterhood copying them yet selling themselves for power the matr did not have Mastery of mange they used an inadequate substance which turned their eyes orange instead of the
[05:47:53] characteristic blue within blue which marked spice addiction these m gained power through sexual enslavement they aped some of the Benz ways but possessed none of their deeper awareness and yet
[05:48:07] they dared Place themselves at the center of worship Taza clearly understood schwang Yu's message the matr had acted the ones out of the scattering sought the benzer Elder secrets secrets
[05:48:20] lost to them during their time away from the old Empire Tazza commands Bali who was trained by T to go to Gamu in search of of myte and the goola with as many resources as he needs she suspects that
[05:48:33] the goola never left the planet back on rakus odrade continues with the plan though she wonders why the goola is not yet on the planet she takes Shana and Waf to DAR espot the place where Leo's
[05:48:47] no room had been found they go into the desert to find a worm odrade intends to force Waf into a religious experience and observe him Shana begins dancing
[05:48:59] summoning shaan odra looks into the distance and feels the coming of a vision a warning she realizes that she is looking at the place where the one God was divided the place where leato II
[05:49:13] had fallen into the Idaho river 1500 years ago she wonders if the Heretics of The Sisterhood had been correct what would come out of them meddling in the remnants of the tyrant's work as as the
[05:49:28] worm approaches odr resigns herself to whatever fate is to come WF is overcome with religious exaltation a cilent hiss Subterranean
[05:49:41] and muted by sand it became louder with shocking swiftness there was heat in it a noticeable warming of the breeze that Twisted down their Rocky Avenue the
[05:49:54] hissing swelled to a crescendo Roar abruptly the Crystal ring gaping of a gigantic mouth lifted over the Dune directly above Shiana shaan sh screamed
[05:50:07] not breaking the rhythm of her dance here I am shaian as it crested the Dune the worm dipped its mouth downward toward Shana sand cascaded around her feet forcing her to stop her dance the
[05:50:21] smell of cinnamon filled the rocky defile the worms stopped above them messenger of God wa breathed heat dried the perspiration on od's exposed face
[05:50:34] and made the automatic insulation of her still suit puff outward perceptibly she inhaled deeply sorting the components behind that cinnamon assault daintily
[05:50:46] like a child on unfamiliar ground the worm once more moved forward it slid across the Dune Crest curled itself down onto the exposed rock and presented its
[05:50:58] burning mouth slightly above and about two paces from Shiana as it stopped odr became conscious of the deep furnace rumbling of the worm she could not tear her gaze away from the reflections of
[05:51:12] lambient orange Flames within the creature it was a cave of mysterious fire odra could see that Shana commanded the Worm but she could also see that it was not the girl's words that moved the
[05:51:26] creature but something else W came up beside odra his translate gaze fixed on the worm I am here he whispered odr silently cursed him any unwarranted
[05:51:40] noise could attract this Beast onto them she knew what w was thinking though no other chaku had ever stood this close to a descendant of his Prophet not even the rakan priest had ever done this with her
[05:51:54] right hand Shan made a sudden downward gesture down to us Shan she said the worm lowered its gaping mouth until the internal fire pit filled the rocky defile in front of them her voice little
[05:52:07] more than a whisper Shana said see how shaian OB Bays me mother oade could feel Shana's control over the worm a pulse of hidden language between the child and monster it was
[05:52:22] uncanny though odr is annoyed by wa she knew that never before had one of the Benny chz had an opportunity to study a TXU Master religiously the Insight she was gathering was highly valuable the
[05:52:36] three of them Mount the worm and shitan moves though Shana had commanded the creature she had only been allowed to ride a worm once before the day Shi halud brought her to the city of keen
[05:52:49] years ago now the worm moved again of its own accord towards that place of od's vision members of the priest and the Ben jzd followed behind in thopters
[05:53:02] eventually the worm did stop and when they dismounted it merely returned into the Sands the way it had came the immortal hand of the god Emperor still moved those creatures in the sand it had
[05:53:16] come to this place of its own free will drawn back toward the place where Leo's inless dream had begun the three of them end up falling deep into a sand slope it is only then
[05:53:30] that odr realizes the place they had fallen into an ancient fan water storage Basin they were in si to bore sar's place during the time of Paul at trades
[05:53:43] the place where leato II had hidden his spice horde the place had long since been cleaned out odra believes that she is the one being brought here for a purpose using her knowledge of the
[05:53:56] missionar protectiva she manipulates wa into staying behind while she explores the place she gives Shana instruction to keep an eye on him odrade can still sense the warning from her other
[05:54:10] memories she finds several desert mummified bodies that had been stabbed to death in what looked like ritual killings she knew that the bodies could not be from the fan times they were from
[05:54:23] the famine times and made her fearful odrade could still smell smell the residue of milange in the place and wanted to turn back but something compelled her forward she finds a word
[05:54:36] carved on the floor arafel she knows the meaning the cloud Darkness at the end of the universe she realizes that the god Emperor had reached out of the past to send her a
[05:54:51] message written in ancient chopa she finds the word here it leads her to a trap door inside odre discovers a great treasure
[05:55:01] of mange 90,000 long tons it was half a Year's Harvest on the entire planet of rakus geniusly hidden and left there by lato II for her to find written on the
[05:55:16] walls in the ancient atraes language were the words of the god Emperor a reverend mother will read my words something cold settled in od's gut she moved to her right with the light

[05:56:26] path you knew the necessity your failure condemned me the god Emperor to Millennia of personal despair the words God Emperor were not
[05:56:39] written in chopa but in the language of the islamiat where they conveyed an explicit second meaning to any speaker of that tongue your God and your Emperor

[05:57:46] turn and turn along the golden path yes that was what Taza had meant but don't you see the common people of rakus have been calling him Titan for more than a
[05:57:59] thousand years so Tazza had known this thing without ever seeing these words she had known I see your design terasa and I know the burden of fear you have
[05:58:12] carried all these years I can feel it every bit as deeply as you do o Dr knew then that this warning sense would not leave until she ended or The Sisterhood

[06:02:44] much more than their skills now that they were outside of the no Globe they could be detected by life scanners they could hear the sounds of battle in the distance the ground rumbled they could hear shouting and
[06:02:58] voices in the distance tag recognized face dancers he tells Lucilla and Duncan to run the attackers Advanced on him he fired at them but they did not fire back he realized that they wanted him alive
[06:03:13] the tayak Su could expend any number of face dancers to run down his L gun's charge he attempts to run but he is stunned and captured Lucilla and Duncan make it to an armored ground car Bali

[06:04:09] wakes he encounters Three Strange figures they put a device known as a t- probe on his head a device from the scattering the pain it caused him was Exquisite as they attempted to penetrate
[06:04:22] his mind he wonders if there is a greater pain he wonders if this is what the spice Agony feels like for Reverend mothers the captors continue to increase the pain even more and then suddenly
[06:04:36] Stillness miles T wonders if he is dead but he is not the device takes over his flesh and he feels as though another person is sharing his body it was
[06:04:48] reading his senses trying to block his awareness it was copying him T attempts to counter the probe using his men had powers blocking it from copying his memories but it would have everything
[06:05:02] else T centered his focus on the movements of the probe he found that he could anticipate it now as if he was growing some new muscle his captors wonder why they cannot read his mind and
[06:05:15] then he forces his eyes open from his perspective the three are moving in ultr slow motion in the time of several ey blinks T escapes from confinement killing his captures with Supreme bloody
[06:05:29] ease he had predicted their every move using his mentat abilities tag determines that the agony of the probe had lifted him to some new level of ability hidden powers that had been
[06:05:42] awaiting within him had been unlocked out of necessity taking the form of this strange new kind of prience slowly he felt himself returned to a normal sense of time he escaped to the outside he
[06:05:57] knew the place he was in the city of yesai he was free on the bny jzr secret Planet Chapter House some sisters are calling for Orr's death after what she did on rakus the Ben Jes were still wary
[06:06:11] of the atra's flaws they did not fully trust their hunger for power which was evident by their history the Heretics of The Sisterhood believe that The Sisterhood was playing directly into the hands of the TXU who made this Duncan
[06:06:26] gool for their own purposes they believed that they will be forced to serve the TXU design which would be worse than the time of the Tyrant they would be vulnerable and perhaps even further considering Leo's message
[06:06:41] perhaps the goola project had never been truly theirs from the start but instead something that was set in motion by leato II himself Leo's message in Siege to boor worries Taza she wonders if The
[06:06:55] Sisterhood is in now crushed by Invaders from the scattering Taza decides that she must go to rakus and she may have to do what the others want kill odrade on
[06:07:08] Gamu T went to appear before an honored MRE as the Benny jzr Bashar he knew there was danger in the place T deduces that the place is a bank the honored mtre that he met was Old Tag had not
[06:07:22] expected her age she tells him that if he ever sees her eyes is fully orange then that means that he has offended her Beyond her ability to tolerate she tells T the Benny jzer are no match for the
[06:07:36] matr I'm sure you understand this kind of power generally Bashar she said the Ben jzr trained you well they are quite talented but not I fear as talented as
[06:07:49] we are the old MRE summons the MRE who is meant to mark tag t s the danger he determines that he must use his new talents T becomes the Whirlwind he was a
[06:08:03] monstrous threat he made his way through the complex as a blurred sweep slaughtering everyone he met as blood sloshed around him doing so required minimal mental effort blood splattered him as he drove himself through the
[06:08:18] headquarters building slaughtering everyone he met as he had learned from the B jeser teachers the great problem of the human universe in how you managed procreation he could hear the voice of his first teacher as he carried
[06:08:32] destruction through the building you may think of this only as sexuality but we prefer the more basic term procreation it has many facets and offshoots it has apparently unlimited energy the emotion
[06:08:45] Called Love is only one small aspect T crushed the throat of a man standing rigidly in his path and at last found the control room for the building's defenses T knows that this transformation had something to do with
[06:08:59] his atra's blood as he ran toward an alley the people he passed seemed as still as statues he examined himself and could see that his blood was black that moment of ultimate pain and crisis had
[06:09:14] forced him into a new domain of human potential the god Emperor's design he now possessed a double vision a strange pressence tag realized that he could
[06:09:27] also sense the positions of no ships and decides that he will Capture One his double vision provided him with the path Lucilla and Bali head to the safe place to rendevu with Duncan there they
[06:09:41] encounter a young woman and Lucilla immediately knows that something is off about her the woman named merbella is an honored MRE she attempts to kill Bali after he tries to slap her and she
[06:09:55] assumed that Lucilla is a great honored MRE because of her clothing and because of the ease in which Lucilla subdues her merbella tells Lucilla that she has subdued Duncan and that she intends to
[06:10:07] complete the sexual enslavement of him during the process however Duncan gains access to the memories of all the other Duncan Idaho he is crushed by the memories he can see his deaths all of
[06:10:22] them he remembers the Axel tanks the gross living female flesh the TXU design the hidden thing in him awakens the secret to destroying the matr he
[06:10:35] overwhelms merbella forcing her to lose control of her own responses merbella realizes who Duncan is the matr were warned of aola possessing of forbidden knowledge gifted by the TXU she wanted
[06:10:50] to kill him but she could not Lucilla had watched from another room when she comes in Bella begs her to kill Duncan but Lucilla says that Duncan will go to
[06:11:02] rakus on rakus tasa tells odr that the preservation of The Sisterhood is the only important thing odr tells Tazza that the TXU give the appearance of full cooperation but something is disturbing
[06:11:16] her she wonders if their Axel tanks are truly tanks she suggests to Taza that they could be surrogates living organisms the remnants of the TXU
[06:11:31] females no one had ever seen a TXU female it was monstrous odr tells the Mother Superior what she has learned of the matr from the tacu they had surpassed the sexual skills of Benny JZ
[06:11:45] imprinters such as Lucilla but the honored matr employed their skills in a manner that is ultimately fatal to themselves and others odr suggests that the change that the TXU had made to the
[06:11:58] Duncan Idaho goola was to make him the equivalent of a male honored MRE that's why the honored matr attacked their keep on Gamu believing the goola was there Taza realized that they did not know
[06:12:13] what this goola was and now that he had been reawakened he was unpredictable the sequencing of the gool's education became shambles even before they escape from the Gamu keep he leaped ahead of his teachers to grasp
[06:12:26] things that were only implied and he did this at an alarmingly accelerated rate who knows what he has become by now the TXU meddled with the forces that had produced their quizat Tarak and led
[06:12:40] to 3,500 years of subjugation under the Tyrant after meeting Shana Tazza determines that Shana will be loyal in exchange for Benny Jes teachings tasa had been intrigued by the young girl and
[06:12:55] Shana recognized the power of the Mother Superior I am informed that you may become one of us teraza said both women could see the effect of this on the Girl by now Shana was more fully aware of a
[06:13:09] reverend mother's accomplishments the powerful beam of Truth had been focused on her she had begun to grasp at the enormous body of knowledge The Sisterhood had accumulated over the
[06:13:22] Millennia she had been told about selective me memory transmission about the workings of other memories about the spice Agony and here before her stood the most powerful of all reverent
[06:13:36] mothers one from whom nothing was hidden Tazza and odra believed that one day Shiana could become a Mother Superior of extraordinary ability Tazza
[06:13:49] odra and Shiana and the B JZ company along with Waf and the high priest tuck who had been replaced by a face dancer after he was killed convene at Dar asalat it is a tense Gathering Tazza sensed a danger of violence in the
[06:14:04] meeting it appears that the false tuck had convinced himself that he is actually tuck W is surprised by this and cannot control him never before had he
[06:14:15] seen a face dancer behave in this way it was the bzr plot this false tuck was now a creature of The Sisterhood and remembered nothing of his face Dan Origins the tacu had designed these new
[06:14:29] face dancers too well one could only imagine what was happening with the face dancers that TXU had implanted among the fish beers and the ixian Waf was greatly intimidated by
[06:14:41] tasa Taza tells Waf that they will serve the tacu but they will never become Axel tanks Waf was shocked Sisterhood knew even the secret of the T Lau Axel tanks
[06:14:55] Waf attempted to Signal his face dancers to attack but Taza stops him assuring him that the telaku will fall if he does not agree WF ground his teeth what was she
[06:15:09] doing he entertained the Mad thought that The Sisterhood had clogged his mind with some secret drug in the air they knew things denied to others he stared from Tazza to odra and back to Tazza he
[06:15:24] knew he was old with serious goola resurrections but not old in the way of the bzar these people were old they seldom looked old but they were old old beyond anything he dared imagine Waf has no
[06:15:39] choice but to accept odre tells Shana that the honored MRE will come to rakus they had returned from the scattering because they see the old Empire as an easy conquest at the
[06:15:53] penthouse at Daris balot the honored MRE attack Tazza sees the beam from the thopter and recognizes that her own death is imminent the beam sever both of her legs but she manages to cut off the
[06:16:07] blood flow from her wounds she reminds herself that the pain was not as great as the spice Agony she thinks to herself I have one odrade comes to Tazza as she
[06:16:19] lies dying placing their foreheads together they share memories odra is now the Mother Superior odr and Shana head towards the no room sometime later T's
[06:16:33] stolen no ship arrives on rakus he has arranged to meet Shana and odr in the desert they will arrive upon the back of a worm T meets with Lucilla aboard the no ship and tells her that they are
[06:16:46] there to pick up odra Shana and a worm he tells heard that he and his people will remain to create a diversion he knew that the honored MRE would destroy rakus when they learned that the goola
[06:16:59] the secret to their demise was there it had been taza's design all along the goola had been baked when odra boards the no ship she
[06:17:11] comes to T for quite some time now she had known that he was her father looking at him now she could see that something had been changed about him something was different he tells her to take the ship
[06:17:24] to Chapter House and that the Golem must go with them too they had to change taza's original design he was no longer just bait for the destruction of the planet they
[06:17:36] needed his talents T tells bismal that he will take over as Bashar odra Shana Duncan balii Lucilla and a single worm escaped the destruction of the planet
[06:17:50] rackus the honored MRE merbella is held prisoner WF and his face dancers die on the planet of the Prophet T had sacrificed himself so that the others
[06:18:02] could escape the H MRE Unleashed their obliterator weapons scorching the surface of the planet Doom killing all life on the surface the planet of muad home of The
[06:18:16] zins Wanderers where the god Emperor had ruled from for 4,000 years was gone on chapter house odr adjust to taza's Memories she knew some in The
[06:18:30] Sisterhood would not like that she was the Mother Superior many in The Sisterhood still distrusted the atres their history had shown a hunger for power she knew her position may be
[06:18:43] temporary The Sisterhood had tested Shana she too was a trodes descended from ciona and immune from prience the worm they had captured was near
[06:18:56] metamorphosis and when the time came they would bathe it in a mixture of mange and water converting it into Min sand trout they would release them onto chapter house they would create a second
[06:19:11] Dune Tazza had wanted the destruction of rakus to eliminate almost all worms according to her they were an oracular Force which held the universe in bondage
[06:19:24] the worms containing a pearl of Leo's awareness magnified that grasp he did not predict events but instead he had created them by the time the worms
[06:19:37] returned to their larger numbers humankind would be far too numerous doing too many different things no single Force could rule over all of their Futures completely but this was
[06:19:50] always his design merbella and the goola are being held inside of the no ship merbella is pregnant with Duncan's child Duncan still insists that he will not serve The Sisterhood telling o Dre that
[06:20:05] he will never be a stud for them Duncan had realized some time ago that he had never fully trusted the witches not even the lady Jessica odra promises to help
[06:20:18] Duncan in any ways that she can when he asked why she responds by saying this because my a ancestors loved you because my father loved you love you witches
[06:20:32] can't fill love she stared down at him for almost a minute the bleached hair was growing out dark at the roots and curling once more into ringlets especially at his neck she saw I feel
[06:20:46] what I feel she said and your water is ours Duncan Idaho seeing the effect that these ancient fan words had had UND Duncan odre turns and leaves the room she looks
[06:21:00] upon the worm they had captured the last pearl of Leo's awareness they had freed him Shana would be trained as a Benz sister and eventually lead the project
[06:21:13] to breed new worms on chapter House leato II the god Emperor the Tyrant had helped the Benny jzr Sisterhood find their Noble purpose
[06:21:28] 10,000 years since leato began his metamorphosis from human into the sandworm of rakus and historians still argue over his motives was he driven by
[06:21:41] the desire for long life he lived more than 10 times the normal span of 300 standard years but consider the price he paid was it the lure of power he is
[06:21:55] called the Tyrant for good reason but what did power bring him that a human might want was he driven to save humankind from itself we have only his words about his
[06:22:09] golden path to answer this and I cannot accept the self-serving records of Dar espot might there have been other gratifications which only his experiences would
[06:22:23] illuminate without better evidence idence the question is moot we are reduced to saying only that he did it the physical fact alone is
[06:22:35] undeniable next in this series we will cover Chapter House Dune the final book in Frank Herbert's original Dune Saga Chapter House picks up several years after the events of Heretics as The Sisterhood awaits for young worms to

[06:27:20] odrade the honored matr drastically outnumbered the B jrit they had had been expanded exponentially by their venturing out into the scattering and they were ruthless odr knew it was only a matter of time before they located the
[06:27:33] hidden location of the planet chapter house she also knew that if the honored mtre did eventually discover the location of the planet and attempt to invade they would collect nothing of use from chapter house od's plan if such
[06:27:47] events occurred was to release as many Ben jesr cells as possible into the scattering carrying with them Millennia of Jes teachings and traditions along with the store of sand trout eventually the different selves of The Sisterhood
[06:28:02] now themselves scattered could perhaps produce countless Dunes out there in the infinite Universe the temporary home World chapter house the Benny jzr would annihilate themselves the honored matr would find no more than charred ruins on
[06:28:16] chapter house The Sisterhood could never risk its deepest teachings falling into their hands odrade was of course descended from Paul a TR ades whose bloodline had been tampered with by The Sisterhood for
[06:28:28] Generations finally before it culminated in him the quizat sarak his son Leo II would eventually become the worm God emperor of the Imperium subjecting the universe to 3500 years of authoritarian
[06:28:42] rule when his tyranny was broken The Sisterhood continued to make use of the atraes Gen though they were wary of any form of prean there had been attempts made to erase prean from at tr's genes
[06:28:54] and entirely however the success in this had been limited O tr's blood gave her the gift of limited prean and she only used it with great caution she knew that what she did in the coming months would
[06:29:08] determine either the survival or the destruction of the V JZ in the last novel in the series Heretics of Dune odrade received a message from the god Emperor a message left behind in the past only to be revealed to her at that
[06:29:22] specific moment o believes that she understands the message that the god Emperor left for her at sich tuber on arus all things die but the Benny jzr could not die before the completion of its
[06:29:36] purpose the same ominous Vision had repeatedly come to her in her dreams she walked across the chasm on a tight rope and someone she dared not turn to see who was coming from behind with an axe
[06:29:50] to cut the rope she could feel the rough Twist of fiber beneath bare feet she felt a cold wind blowing a smell of burning on that wind and she knew the one with the axe approached each
[06:30:03] perilous step required all of her energy step step the Rope swayed and stretched her arms out straight on each side struggling for balance if I fall The
[06:30:16] Sisterhood Falls the Benny Chester would end in the chasm beneath the Rope as with any living thing The Sisterhood must end sometime a reverend mother dare not deny it but not here not falling the
[06:30:29] Rope severed we must not let the Rope be cut I must get across the chasm before the axe wielder comes the Rope she walked was Destiny she was The Sisterhood and behind her approached the
[06:30:42] mystery adversaries who or whatever they might be intending to cut the rope ending The Sisterhood Forever at this point in time something in her pressence seems to warn her it
[06:30:56] was an ache she could not touch it appeared to her in the form of sea child an echo of her childhood self when odra was young before the Reverend mothers of the Ben JZ had such sway over her life
[06:31:10] she had gone on sea excursions with the man and woman she had called Mama and Papa those were some of her happiest times when she felt the most connected to her essential self a drift amongst
[06:31:22] the gentle waves she found a place of Stillness lift and fall of ways the sense of unbounded horizons with strange new places just beyond the curved limits
[06:31:36] of a watery world that thrilling edge of danger implicit in the very substance that supported her by allowing her mind to drift back into that place o'r can connect with her basic self it gave her
[06:31:50] the ability to maintain her selfhood when confronted with unex expected waves at this crucial time in B jzd history her mind in the form of sea child drifted to ladis ladis was one of the
[06:32:05] most valued planets in the sisterhood's network of Worlds it was probably second only to Chapter House the largest chunk of the Benz military force led by balii
[06:32:17] the Protege of Miles tag protected the world lampidis also contained the sisterhood's most prized school where the best of them were trained in the Ben jzr way the sisterhood's most premier
[06:32:31] students resided on the world the library of lampadas was said to be unmatched a storehouse of knowledge likely dating back thousands of years the Reverend mother Lucilla also an
[06:32:43] atres descendant and cousin to odrade now held the position of Vice Chancellor of ladis because of O's minimal prophetic ability she could not determine the spefic specifics of the threats to The Sisterhood by pressence
[06:32:57] alone but before she has time to act on any of it the bloody Waters of her sea child Vision come to reality before her eyes lampus is attacked by the honored
[06:33:10] matr odr felt her chest tighten as she saw the look in Belle's eyes the rulian records went slap as Bela threw them on the table lampus Bela said there was Agony in her voice OD had no need to
[06:33:25] open the roll sea child's bloody Waters had come to reality survivors her voice sounded strained none Bela slumped into the chair dog she kept on the side of
[06:33:36] O's table tamilan entered then and sat behind Banda both looked stricken no survivors lampidis had been fully destroyed in the attack by the honored
[06:33:50] MRE the rabbi a spy of the Ben jzd from a Myster ious secret society residing on the world Gamu had informed them of what happened the axe wielder odre new was now closer than ever
[06:34:04] before part two Lucilla and the secret sect odr before sending her cousin Lucilla to lampidis had commanded that if ever so a Time came where lampidis was in danger she was to collect as many
[06:34:19] of the sisters as she could store them within her other memory by their process of of sharing and escape with the precious lives and knowledge of Lampa distored within her mind odrade informed Lucilla of the mysterious people who
[06:34:33] could help once she escaped the world that secret society on Gamu they're Jews aren't they you may have need of special information because of where we are about to post you extremely casual Nilla
[06:34:46] sink into banda's chair dog without invitation odre picked up a stylus scribbled on a sheet of disposable and passed it to Lilla in a way that hid it from the Comm eyes Lucilla took the hint and bent over the message holding it
[06:34:59] close Beneath The Shield of her head your smise is correct you must die before revealing it that is the price of their cooperation a mark of great trust Lucilla shredded the message o'r used ion Palm identification to unseal a
[06:35:13] panel on the wall behind her she removed a small rulian Crystal and handed it to Lucilla it was warm but Lucilla felt a chill what could be so secret odr swung the the security Hood from beneath her
[06:35:26] worktable and pivoted it into position Lucilla dropped the crystal into its receptacle with the trembling hand and pulled the hood over her head immediately words formed in her mind an oral sense of extremely old accents clipped for
[06:35:41] recognition the people to whom your attention has been called are the Jews they made a defensive decision eons ago the solution to recurrent pilgrims was to vanish from public view space travel made this not only possible but
[06:35:54] attractive they hid on countless planets their own scattering and they probably have planets where only their people live this does not mean they have abandoned old age practices in which they excelled out of survival necessity
[06:36:08] the old religion is sure to persist even though somewhat altered it is probable that a rabbi from ancient times would not find himself out of place behind the Sabbath manur of a Jewish household in your age but their secrecy is such that
[06:36:21] you could work a lifetime beside a Jew and never suspect fact they call it complete cover although they know it's dangerous Lucilla had succeeded in following od's orders before the world of lampadas had been destroyed Lucilla
[06:36:35] fled with the memories of the lost sisters stored within her mind she sought refuge on Gamu once called Yi Prime she knew that it was there that the secret sect of Jews hid because they kept their old traditions they would be
[06:36:49] at least somewhat susceptible to the bzr techniques involving manipulation through religion Lucilla speaks with the rabbi on Gamu the knowledge that she carries within her mind is valuable and must return safely to The Sisterhood the
[06:37:04] rabbi knows that he owes a debt to the bzar The Sisterhood had helped them in many times of need but he informs Lucilla that he does not think that there is any way that she can get off Gamu Gamu at this point in time was
[06:37:17] under the rule of the honor matr escaping this world and avoiding capture would be near impossible but he also knows that the most valuable thing is not in fact her life but the information that she carries and he has a way at
[06:37:31] least to preserve that initially Lucilla insists that he does not understand thinking that he must believe that her information was on crystals and not stored within her mind but he understands far more than she realizes
[06:37:46] he then reveals a secret a secret that the Jews have never revealed to the Ben jzr from behind the only door in the room in stepped a woman named Rebecca her eyes were blue within blue a wild
[06:37:59] Reverend mother Lucilla knew that through her the wisdom of lampadas could be saved as the freman of ancient araus had done so had this sect some cultures like the freman of old arus had the
[06:38:12] ability to sometimes spontaneously produce women with some of the abilities of the benzite but without official training Lucilla agrees to share memories with Rebecca and the B jzr
[06:38:25] way they leaned toward each other until their foreheads made contact their hands went out and gripped the offered shoulders as their minds locked Lucilla forced a projective thought this must
[06:38:37] get to my sisters I promise dear lady Lucilla knew that her chances of living much longer Beyond this point were slim but she was willing to die if she could Aid in their Survival Of The Sisterhood part three the goas and the
[06:38:54] no ship since the destruction of the planet rakus the honored matr have all but eviscerated the TXU race sael a captive of the B JZ is the only known faku
[06:39:07] Master to remain in existence he as all tacu Masters had been was merely a single goola in a line of golas stretching back eons in exchange for the protection of
[06:39:19] the bz Sisterhood sael gave them the knowledge of how to produce golas from a otal tanks and though the process which involved the use of living female flesh disgusted them it was a necessity of the
[06:39:32] trying times agola is of course an exact copy of a person made from the cells collected from their body after death agola could eventually regain the memories of the original person up until their time of death the Benny jzr had
[06:39:47] made use of goas in the past but for the first time ever now had the secret to Goa production themselves without fear of TXU tampering the pragmatic ability to accept things which discust them in
[06:40:00] order to achieve an ultimate goal is one of the key reasons that The Sisterhood has survived up until this point on chapter house years go by and the days blur together as the ecological transformation of the world continues
[06:40:14] the artificially controlled weather of the planet had to be controlled carefully in order to not upset the balance dramatically miles tag continued to grow and already began to show signs that he still possessed the mine which had made
[06:40:28] the previous miles tag possibly the greatest Bashar in Benny JZ history odr intended to have his Memories We awakened eventually that way they could continue to use his abilities by the looks of things they may have to awaken
[06:40:42] the goola sooner than planned technically T was not a goola but a clone a goola was made from the cells of a person specifically after they had already died odr herself had collected at the cells from her father while he
[06:40:55] still lived by using fingernail scraping the now young boy version of T was precious to her you are a special child odr said We Made You from cells taken from A Very Old Man odr owed the
[06:41:10] existence of the young t to the TXU master sael who resided within the ground at noip which had brought the last great worm to chapter house sael had given The Sisterhood the information which allowed them to create their own Axel tanks
[06:41:24] he was essentially a prisoner on the ship and still despised The paenda Witches it was his belief that the dark side of the magical Universe belonged to the B jzer within his body he held a
[06:41:37] secret device which contained information to make several goas both Paul and Chie were there and a new kind of face dancer said to be better than any before face dancers which could
[06:41:49] truly become another and not be detected even by azit Duncan Idaho is also a prisoner on the no ship along with merbella the former honored MRE merbella had grown much more loyal to The
[06:42:02] Sisterhood and was on her way to becoming a reverend mother the inhabitants of the no ship were under constant surveilance if Escape was ever attempted the no ship had been rigged with mines by the Reverend mother Banda
[06:42:16] The Sisterhood could prevent any living thing from leaving the no ship no matter how fast the ship had been deactivated and was now grounded merbella and Duncan now had several children together they
[06:42:29] had bound each other by way of mutual sexual dependency Duncan had also trained other Ben jzr males in the same techniques to reverse H mre's sexual enslavement The Sisterhood had originally intended to use Duncan to
[06:42:43] control Shana by bonding but now intended to study his children with merbella The Sisterhood had long known that the txo had done something to this particular Duncan Idaho goola many in The Sisterhood feared that he may be
[06:42:58] another quizat tatarak Duncan himself was beginning to understand something of what he was though he did not know how they had done it perhaps the texu had hidden it within a secret Gene this Duncan had more than the memories of the
[06:43:13] original Dune Duncan he possessed the memories of countless Duncan idose he knew that the god Emperor leato II had killed him more times than he could count his other lives had often spoke out to him coming up from the void to
[06:43:28] warn or suggest within the no ship in the chamber where they at first brought the worm from rakus it still smelled of spice many times when he entered this place it would trigger a vision he would
[06:43:42] see what appeared to him as a kind of net shimmering beyond the net would be a man and woman who would always notice him they would speak of danger and that would always snap him from the vision eventually Duncan realized that they
[06:43:57] looked like face dancers who had been the Servants of the TXU for many eons but Duncan could also tell just by looking that the pair he saw here belonged to no one but themselves no one
[06:44:09] truly understood the Holtzman effect they used his formula because it worked it folded space from point A to point B not even Guild Navigators claimed to know the reason why Duncan Ida was a
[06:44:24] mtat a gift from one of his other lives and the accumulation of enough data ultimately led him to an involuntary minat projection someone out there has found
[06:44:37] another way to use holtzman's theories it was a full Menat projection his Menat Powers lead him to believe that these honored MRE did not simply come back into the old Empire by
[06:44:50] choice they fled something they fled the ones he saw in his vision the ones who saw him back who were those people he saw strong enough to drive out honored
[06:45:04] MRE he knew it for a projection datam he then realized part of od's plan to send cells of the Benny jzr out into the scattering he saw nothing but failure in the plan of all the sisters that had
[06:45:18] gone into the scattering not one had returned only the matre how could they expect otherwise something changes fundamentally out there in space existing outside of the bounds of the
[06:45:31] old Empire forces change forces adaptation The Divided cells of the B jzr odr sent out would cease to be truly Ben jzr the moment they go off into the new scattering just as they did before
[06:45:45] Duncan intends to escape the no ship but not in the way The Sisterhood expects but first he will allow o to use him part four Shana the heretic Shana who
[06:45:59] had been born on rakus was thought to be dead by most of the human universe as a girl on rakus the planet once known as dune Shana discovered that she had the ability to control the desert worms she
[06:46:12] was the sand Rider said to have been predicted by leer II himself because of her powers the priesthood on arus had worshiped and watched over her believing her to be the daughter of the divided
[06:46:25] God it is not clear why the pearls of leato II's awareness that resided in the sandworms of Ras in the era following his death responded in the way they did to Shiana but whatever the reason the B
[06:46:38] jzr knew that this girl was important they watched over her carefully for years before finally making her one of them now she resided on chapter house and even in death she was still worshiped as a goddess by a countless
[06:46:52] number of humans Shana led the desert Watch program watching the new deserts of chapter house for signs of spice blows which would indicate the arrival of new worms if Shana retained the
[06:47:06] ability to control these sand worms as she had the ones on rakus then the eventual process of spice collection would become less hazardous but there was also the distinct possibility that the worms would never develop it had
[06:47:21] been tried many times before to create another another Dune none of those previous attempts by others in the Imperium had ever succeeded the worms simply would not take to the new worlds
[06:47:33] perhaps Shana's presence here could make a difference but there was no guarantee Shiana was now a full Reverend mother of the bz but she like many Reverend mothers who had come before her was a
[06:47:46] heretic she was Ben jzr and yet she defied them the sisterhood's missionar protect IA was always at work and they had plans for Shiana once the worms returned they would release Shiana unto
[06:48:01] the unsuspecting Universe she would become a myth made real as Paul L trates had once been they intended to create a new religion surrounding her to make her a living goddess and they intended to do
[06:48:14] so using Duncan Idaho's help as a Menat the Ben JZ had always used religion as a method of control and they knew that the honored matr too paid lip service to the worship of the god emperor in his variant name of
[06:48:29] gor this would at least in some way also influence them Shana however desired none of this and intended to escape them The Sisterhood did not suspect it but she knew the way to disarm banda's Minds
[06:48:43] aboard Duncan's noip as well as the way to reactivate the ship itself the other sisters also did not realize that she and Duncan had begun to form a secret Bond sharing in their descent for The
[06:48:57] Sisterhood Shana knew that she would be forced to test that antique thing to its limits probably breaking it and that black pla form seeking outlet from the wild place within her was the only
[06:49:09] element of this that she knew she had to do call it Rebellion Call It by Any Other Name the force she felt in her breast could not be denied Shana was determined to be independent of the B
[06:49:23] jzr to be free to shape her own future as she saw fit every ounce of her being resisted Conformity part five the honored
[06:49:36] matr the honored matr possessed little of the Ben jzr skills of emotional control in fact they were prone to fits of blind Rage which in part could be contributed to the spice substitute they became accustomed to within the
[06:49:50] scattering the substance provided them with some but not all of the benefits of spice and also gave their eyes an eerie orange glow outwardly the honored mre's Fain superiority to the Ben jeser but
[06:50:03] the Ben jzer could see that something in the honor MRE felt regret for the ways they had lost while in the scattering the honored mrr also did not possess the precise control of internal chemistry that was key to many of the Benny jate
[06:50:17] abilities such as the ability to resist poison and disease the ability to slow aging and the ability to unlock ancestral Memories the honored matr had of course been the remnants of leato II's fish speakers as well as some of
[06:50:32] the Ben Jes sisters who had disappeared into the scattering 1500 years ago likely a necessity of survival outside the bounds of the old Empire still something had drawn them back into this
[06:50:45] domain that too was an indication that they were not as powerful as they would hope to appear Lucilla is eventually captured by the honored matres and brought to the world of Junction a world in the Gamu
[06:50:59] system they brought her before the great honor matre dhama the Spider Queen herself they wield her into the honor mre's presence in a tube like cave deadly sharp sugar wire netting preventing her from leaving the center
[06:51:13] of the tube the great honored MRE tells Lucilla that the cage is in fact for her own protection for the honored mrees were conditioned to kill instantly if the Min jzr power of voice is tried on
[06:51:25] them behind the great honored MRE sat a cage containing another being almost human but not quite a futar futar were cat-like humanoid creatures born out of the scattering initially they had been
[06:51:40] created as a weapon against the honored matr by the ones of many faces who the honored MRE had apparently war with in the scattering The Cry of a futar could be deadly to an honored MRE futar were

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
06:51:53] said to be controllable only by their handlers but somehow the honored MRE had managed to tame and control some futar Lucilla figures out that the honored MRE somehow make themselves poisonous to futar if a futar attempted
[06:52:08] to eat one of them they would taste of bitter burning poison that would Scar the inside of the futar mouth Lucilla remains captive for many days and she is interrogated by the Spider Queen several times as she remains captive of the
[06:52:23] honored mrr Lucilla begins to feel the coming on of spice withdrawal which she used the very best of her Ben jeser abilities to suppress the Ben jzr had excellent timekeeping abilities so Lucilla knew exactly how long she had
[06:52:36] been a prisoner of the own matr this was just one of the B jzr abilities that troubled the honored matre for they recognized that the B jzr skill set was astronomical how do you know what time
[06:52:49] it is sinking back into her chair but eyes still flam all B jzr have this ability we can fill the rhythms of any planet after a short time on it a strange Talent anyone can
[06:53:01] do it a matter of being sensitized could I learn this orange fading I said anyone You're Still Human aren't you a question not yet fully answered why do you say
[06:53:14] you witches have no government once to change the subject our abilities worry her the honored mtre had powerful skills of their own for instance their combat skills surpassed that of the mini jeser
[06:53:27] they moved extremely quick often using their feet to kill the honored matr were extremely aggressive and bound to fits of deadly rage Lucilla would eventually become the subject of the great honor
[06:53:39] MRE dh's rage and it was there that she met her end I told you not to speak you dare call me dhama she was out of her chair in a blur lucilla's cage door slammed open with a crash against the
[06:53:54] wall Lucilla tried to dodge but the Shiga confined her she did not see the kick that crushed her Temple as she died lucilla's awareness was filled with a scream of Rage the horde of latus venting emotions it had confined for
[06:54:09] many generations as Lucilla died so did the precious lives contained within her mind if Rebecca failed in her task to redeliver those inner lives to the vzr then they would be lost
[06:54:25] Forever part six a merger of man and machine on chapter house odr begins to use Duncan Idaho as a mint hat he has also been put in charge of training and eventually Reawakening the goolam miles
[06:54:39] tags memories he has also forced o to realize that her plan to send individual Ben jzr cells would likely be futile some on chapter house consider od's employment of Duncan as exceedingly
[06:54:54] dangerous the Reverend mother Banda is one of them Bala is also a minat and believes that it is necessary for Duncan to be eliminated when o'r leaves Central on chapter house Banda uses her
[06:55:07] opportunity she enters the no ship with the intent to kill Duncan which she very well would have been capable of doing she discovers Duncan within a chamber of the noip the Goa boy tag is there as
[06:55:19] well hello Bell been expecting you he touched his console field and the door opened behind him young tag entered and took up a position near Idaho staring silently at bonda Idaho did not invite
[06:55:33] her to sit or find a chair for her forcing her to bring one from his sleeping chamber and place it facing him when she was seated he turned a look of worry Amusement to her Banda remained taken aback by his greeting why did he
[06:55:47] expect me he answered her unspoken question Dar projected earlier she told me she was off to see Shana I knew you'd waste no time getting to me when she was gone simple mtat projection
[06:56:00] or she warned you wrong What secrets do you and Shana share demanding she uses me in the way that you want her to use me the miona Bell two Menat together must we play these stupid Games bonda
[06:56:16] took a deep breath and sought mtat mode not easy under these circumstances that child staring at her the amusement on Idaho's face Idaho calmed himself when he saw that Banda had entered mtat mode
[06:56:29] he tells her that he has known for quite some time that she's wanted him dead she realizes then that she has been transparent in her intentions he explains to her that they have mutual goals put yourself in my place Bel I'm a
[06:56:43] mtat caught not only in your trap but in that of the honored matr is that all you are a mint hat no I'm a TX experiment but I don't see the future I'm not a
[06:56:55] quizat hatak I'm a mtat with memories of many lives you with your other memories think about the leverage that gives me by the end Banda recognizes the extent
[06:57:08] of why odrade valued this Duncan the god Emperor had reawakened the goola again and again throughout countless generations for a reason banda's mentat awareness recognized this Duncan begins to speak to her of of the Ians and the
[06:57:23] potential for technological progression within the scattering when leato iI died the human Empire expanded exponentially none could say what strange technology might have risen out
[06:57:36] of the scattering nothing is out of question in the scattering but not within our present capabilities do you have something less ambitious review the genetic markers in the cells of your people look for common patterns in The
[06:57:50] atres Inheritance the there may be talents you have not even guessed Duncan throws much at bonda at once even hinting at the genetic patterns which led to T's actions on Gamu in the
[06:58:03] previous book where he moved faster than the human eye could see Duncan then suggest that there was a thread of leer the second's plan previously unseen Ians have not penetrated
[06:58:16] holzman's unification concept he said they merely use it a theory that works even when you don't understand it why does he direct my attention to the technocracy of I iians had their fingers in too many pies for the bitty jzr to
[06:58:31] trust them aren't you curious why the Tyrant never suppressed I he asked and when she continued to stare at him he only bridled them he was fascinated by the idea of human and machine
[06:58:44] inextricably bound to each other each testing the limits of the other cyborgs among other things did Idaho know the residue of revoltion left by the butlerian Jihad even among the Ben jesr
[06:58:58] alarming the convergence of what each human and machine could do considering machine limitations that was a succinct description of ixian shortsightedness was Idaho saying the
[06:59:10] Tyrant subscribed to the idea of machine intelligence foolishness she turned away from him Duncan suggest that leer the second believe that the future of mankind was tied to machines this makes
[06:59:24] sense considering the god Emperor himself had used many ixian devices which push the bounds of the butlerian jihad's limits the B JZ initially is averse to this idea they believe that
[06:59:38] the butlerian Jihad left too great a mark on Humanity for this to be true B leaves the no Ship Without attempting to harm Duncan odrade intends to allow merbella to undergo the spice Agony in
[06:59:51] an attemp attt to become a reverend Mother after marbella's latest child with Duncan is born Duncan feared that once merbella undertook the agony that her allegiance to the Ben jzd would be
[07:00:03] complete she would no longer be his but a creature of The Sisterhood o'r also intended to have Tag's goola memories awakened very soon through sexual impation which she planned to have
[07:00:16] Shiana perform the imprint would also make him controllable by the Ben jzr sister Hood odra meets with sael and employs her B Jes skills in another attempt to gain all of the secrets of
[07:00:29] the Axel tanks he continues to resist and does not fully trust her no matter what she does he continues to demand that he must have his own face dancer servants and ax lot tanks before he
[07:00:42] would release his secrets to the benzar during the meeting odra receives a message from Shiana a spice blow has occurred in the desert of Chapter House there are thousands of young sandworms
[07:00:54] odre tells sael that the Benny jzd have been the Shepherds of his Prophet the last remnants of leato II The Divided God worshiped by the TXU were cradled by the benzer Cel realizes that the Ben jzer no
[07:01:10] longer need his secret of how to produce spice mange within axotal tanks they now have their own continuous Supply the celebration of this Victory is cut short however when odra receives the news that
[07:01:22] the Benny Jes pilot claree was mortally injured in a thopter crash odr knew they could not afford to lose Clare at this point only one option remained an option which would leave Clare as something
[07:01:35] other than human Duncan had suggested that leer II believed that Humanity's future was inextricably tied to machines and considering this situation perhaps he was right the only thing that would
[07:01:48] save Clare would be machine augmentation the thought of it made the sisters of the B Jes shudder considering the butan Jihad the drastic times however called for drastic measures Clare would become
[07:02:01] the Ben jz's first ever cyborg first the Axel tanks now this necessity said they could not afford to lose Specialists of Clare's caliber they
[07:02:13] had few enough as it was spread thin did not describe it gaps were appearing cyborg clairy though and that was the opening wedge the sus were prepared a precautionary Arrangement shouldn't be required for
[07:02:28] someone Irreplaceable such as Mother Superior cyborg was one of those popery words too where did mechanical additions to human flesh become dominant when was the cyborg no longer human temptations
[07:02:42] intensified just this one little adjustment and so easy to adjust until the popery human becomes unquestioningly obedient but Clare conditions of extremist said cyborg
[07:02:55] himim was The Sisterhood that desperate she was forced to answer in the affirmative odr knew that no objection from any other sister in The Sisterhood could change anything once she had made her decision whatever she chose The Sisterhood would follow the but Larry
[07:03:10] and Jihad had been fought and won now a new conflict began but odr knew that they had no one to replace clery she made the decision to cyborg him a merger of of man and
[07:03:23] machine part seven the two sisterhood's Collide odra knew that in order for the Benz to survive it needed to change its ways and she knew that merbella could potentially be the one to guide them
[07:03:37] into that change the B jzr were slaves of habit and habits had predictable patterns she knew that this was how the arted mattre would eventually locate them Pride that was what odr saw when
[07:03:51] she looked at her sisters and their places dignity was only a mask no real humility instead there was this visible Conformity a true Benny jzr pattern that in a society aware of the Peril in
[07:04:05] patterns sounded warning claxon merbella will soon undergo the spice Agony and is at a Crossroads she is caught in between her love and Obsession for Duncan Idaho and her loyalty to the Ben JZ merbella knew that
[07:04:20] her love for Duncan was in a way a prison but she was incapable of Letting Go o knows that the Duncan idah hoola has been attempting to undermine them in the mind of Marbella prompting her to study the life of Jessica who thousands
[07:04:34] of years ago had betrayed The Sisterhood leading to the eventual birth of the Tyrant Lea II Duncan had prompted Marbella to study Jessica's life hoping to thwart us Hollows of his performance
[07:04:47] had ignited severe analysis of Records an interesting person odre said love after all of your teaching your conditioning you did not think her
[07:04:58] behavior treasonous never delicately now but look at the consequences a quiz at Tarak and that grandchild the Tyrant argument dear to banda's Heart golden
[07:05:12] path Marbella said survival of humankind famine times and the scattering are you watching this Bell no matter you will watch honored matr Marbella said all because of Jessica but Jessica returned
[07:05:28] to the fold and lived out her years on kaladan teacher of acolytes example to them as well see what happens when you defy us defy us merbella do it more adroitly than Jessica odrade had
[07:05:42] suspected long ago that the Ben JZ were wrong in their denouncement of Love even so odr knew that for Marbella to truly become a sister of the Benny jzr she would have to let go of Duncan the Benny
[07:05:55] jzr is all to a reverend mother you will never be able to forget that as quickly as it had come the dream sensation passed mother superior's next words were cold and immediate prepare for more
[07:06:09] advanced training until you meet the agony live or die when the time comes Shana attempts to use sexual imprint to unblock the memories of Miles tags goola but it goes slightly wrong when the
[07:06:23] attempt is made T's memories are reawakened but his long dead mother who had been a sister of the V Jes herself had taught T Benny jz's secrets and also through the method of Hypno induction was able to prevent the impation of her
[07:06:38] son she had done this without the knowledge of The Sisterhood his memories were reawakened but he would be no controllable Pawn of The Sisterhood not in the way they'd hoped Tech had always been loyal to the B jzr however and they
[07:06:51] did not expect that to change once his memories had been restored odrade asked him the question she had been waiting to ask all this time what exactly had occurred on Gamu the day he set the Wrath of the honored matr upon them had
[07:07:05] he truly become a blurred specture of death moving faster than the eye could see I cannot explain what happened to me on gamma my physical and mental speed defies explanation given the size and energy in
[07:07:20] one of your heartbeats I could be clear of this room and well on my way out of the ship oh hand upraised I'm still your obedient dog I'll do what you require but perhaps not in the way you imagine
[07:07:32] odra saw consternation in the faces of her sisters what have I loosed upon us we can prevent any living thing from leaving this ship she said you may be fast but I doubt you are faster than the fire that would engulf you should you
[07:07:45] try to leave without our permission I will leave in my own good time and with your permiss Mission T now reawakened with the skills of the Bashar comes up with the Tactical plan to diffuse the honored matre before they locate Chapter
[07:08:00] House odr arranges a meeting with the honored mrr on the world of Junction a former spacing guild World in the Gamu star system in true B JZ fashion they have managed to convince the honored mrr that the place of meeting had been their
[07:08:14] own idea they will meet in 100 standard days The Sisterhood believed that the mrr had chosen to wait so long so that they could reinforce their defenses on Junction the honored MRE have promised odr safe passage in and out of Junction
[07:08:28] but they are not to be trusted as they have shown no honor even in diplomatic situations dorla who had been sent to organize this meeting with the honored matr now looked as though she had been tortured and they had killed the other sisters in her
[07:08:42] party they conducted experiments on me but that's not important the arrangements are for what it's worth they promise you safe passage in and out of Junction don't believe it you are allowed a small Entourage of servants no
[07:08:57] more than five assume they will kill everyone who accompanies you although I may have taught them the error in that nula tells odr of what she had seen of the futar the humanoid creatures that the hit MRE seem to keep as pets the
[07:09:11] creatures have very simple speech and did not seem to be as intelligent as humans the honor matre had fed the bodies of her sisters to the futar A futar came to the bars of its cage after their banquet it looked at
[07:09:25] the Spider Queen and it screamed I have never heard such a sound chilling every honored MRE in that room froze and I swear to you they were terrified Shana touched dilus arm a predator
[07:09:39] immobilizing its prey undoubtedly the futar appeared surprised that it did not freeze me sometime after marbella's child is born she finally undergos the spice Agony and afterward Duncan can
[07:09:53] sense that merbella is pulling away from him merbella is an honored MRE and yet she is also bzr within her the two sister hoods are joined and merged marbella's purpose had grown Beyond
[07:10:06] Duncan and to some degree they both knew it part8 the Battle of Junction before leaving for junction odr addressed the entire Sisterhood one last time
[07:10:22] actions have been taken that require me to meet on Junction with honored MRE leadership a meeting from which I may not emerge alive I probably will not survive that meeting will be partly
[07:10:34] distraction we are about to punish them o'r waited for murmurs to subside hearing both agreement and disagreement in the sounds interesting the ones who agreed were closer to the stage and farther back among new acolytes
[07:10:48] disagreement from Advanced acolytes yes they knew the warning we dare not feed that fire she pitched her voice lower letting remotes carry it to those in the high tear before leaving I will share
[07:11:01] with more than one sister these times require such caution your plan what will you do questions were shouted at her from many places we will than ad Gamu that should drive the honored MRE allies
[07:11:16] to Junction we then will take Junction and I hope to capture the spider quein odr gives details of her plan to The Sisterhood Bashar milest will lead the attack and disguise ships equipped with
[07:11:30] L guns odrade on the ground will transmit her observations to her attackers they plan to Eng Globe Junction with the devices designed by Duncan Idaho they would reveal the location of honored MRE no ships no one
[07:11:44] knows however that myos t has the ability to see hidden no ships even without technology it was part of what had awakened in him on Gamu when the honored mrr tortured him in the book Heretics of Dune Duncan himself would
[07:11:58] remain on the no ship on chapter house during the attack the B Jes sisters Tam and dorula would accompany odr on Junction the other Sisters of the B jeser were eager to know who she had chosen to share memories with before she
[07:12:11] leaves this is the most pressing political question because after she dies one of those people would become Mother Superior of the Ben jzer odr announces that she has chosen both merbella and Shana to share her memories
[07:12:25] Proctors form little Consulting groups shouting suggestions from group to group but no names were submitted someone had a question though why merbella who knows honored mre's better
[07:12:38] odr asked that silenced them merbella would be present during the attack on Junction as well her job would be to discover the honor mre's Achilles heel after sharing with both merbella and Shan merbella was od's personal choice
[07:12:54] but if this venture to Junction failed then Shana would still be a potent candidate odr knew that if her plan in fact did fail then the survivors in The Sisterhood if there were any would hold her in contempt when odra finally arrived on
[07:13:08] Junction there could be no mistaking that it was in fact a former guild World it seemed to have been changed little since the honor matr came to rule it so this was like other Junction planets some somewhere in Guild records there
[07:13:22] doubtless was a serial number and code for it so long under Guild control before the honored matre that in these first moments of debarking getting their ground legs everything around them could be seen to have that special Guild
[07:13:35] flavor even the playing field designed for outdoor meetings of Navigators in their giant containers of malange gas the buildings of the world wrapped around space in a way that conserved the maximum amount of energy the paths of the world were direct and there were
[07:13:50] very few sidewalks and no plants there was a dull grayness and the place was compounded with ixi and technology for the Guild in Duran was preferred to luxury or eye appeal odrade was piloted down to the surface of the World by the
[07:14:05] now cyborg clbe the pilot touched a yellow field on his board just the way the Bashar said they would a gloating sound in his voice he lifted the hood off his head and turned odra was shocked
[07:14:18] cyborg the face was a metal mask with two glittering silver balls for eyes we enter Dangerous Ground they didn't tell you he asked waste no pity I was dead and this gave me life it's claree Mother
[07:14:32] Superior and when I die this time that will buy me life as a Goa odr is taken in by the honor mre's on Junction while at the same time miles T leads the assault against the honor MRE forces attacking the world of Gamu with
[07:14:46] tremendous force during this time the secret sect of Jews hidden away on Gamu took Refuge within the B jeser forces Marbella immediately recognized Rebecca the woman who Lucilla had shared memories with before dying as a wild
[07:14:59] Reverend mother merbella made an instant identification a wild Reverend mother not since dun's fman days had one of these been known Rebecca carried with her all the lives of lodus precious
[07:15:12] cargo she shares her mind with merbella the Battle of Junction would be the last conflict between the bny JZ and the honor matr on the world of Junction odr comes face to face with the great honor MRE the Spider Queen herself though the woman was not quite as odr
[07:15:28] had expected spider Queen's appearance was more than a surprise until this moment no physical description of her had ever been achieved by the B jzd only temporary projections imaginative
[07:15:41] constructs based on scattered bits of evidence here she was finally a small woman expected stringy muscles visible under red leotards beneath her robe face a forgettable oval with Bland brown eyes
[07:15:54] orange Flex dancing in them during the meeting however the great honor matre dham is poisoned by one of her own logno who then takes over as the great honored MRE herself she intends to activate the
[07:16:06] honor mre's hidden weapon technology brought forth out of the scattering a powerful weapon of bloodless death I am not logos's Target not yet she has taken this opportunity to make her bid for power there was no no need to look at
[07:16:21] dhama the moment of the spider Queen's death was visible on logo's face turning odr confirmed it D laid in a heap under being unknown you will call me great

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
07:16:33] honored MRE LNO said and you will learn to thank me for it she pointing at the red heat on the balcony Corner intended to betray you and exterminate your people I have other plans I am not one
[07:16:47] to destroy a useful weapon at the moment of our greatest need with Tag's tactical skills at full use they are able to gain control of the star system and Benny jzr Victory seems certain they realize all too late that
[07:17:01] they have walked into a trap as the honored MRE release their weapon of bloodless death altering the course of the battle odrade is captured part nine marbella's purpose Shana's
[07:17:16] escape merbella and the others are alerted to the fact that the honor matre have taken odrade but they do not know what is to come the weapon kills without touching it kills without Gore the Benny JZ have never seen its like before when
[07:17:31] he returned to his examination of the scene he saw another disturbing thing a basic audity his eyes had tried to report very little blood of those Fallen figures in Benny jzr uniforms you
[07:17:43] expected battle casualties to show that ultimate evidence of common Humanity flowing red that dark on exposure but always left its indelible Mark in the memories of those who saw it lack of
[07:17:57] bloody Carnage was an unknown and in Warfare unknown had a history of bringing extreme Peril he spoke softly to O trade they have a weapon we have not discovered odrade however had given
[07:18:11] merbella instructions for a last desperate gamble should their attack go wrong Marbella does what she can to save as many Benes soldiers as she possibly can as the honored matr unleash their weapon their survivors set a course for chapter house while she then Pilots a
[07:18:26] shuttle down to the surface of the world Junction she announces herself to the others as an honored MRE claiming to have escaped The Sisterhood Marbella is brought to the great AR matre logno and uses this opportunity to tempt her into
[07:18:40] rage marbella's plan works and LNO attacks merbella but Marbella is far too quick she kills logno with striking speed after the commotion odra is seeing lying
[07:18:53] on the floor as odra lies dying having been mortally wounded by the honored MRE merbella shares memories with her one final time examining the scene without breathing hard to show how easy it was
[07:19:07] sisters merbella experienced a sense of shock and recognition of the inevitable odr lay on the floor in front of ELP who obviously had chosen sides without hesitation the Twisted position of od's neck and flaccid appearance of her body
[07:19:22] said she was dead she tried to interfere elic said having killed a reverend mother elic expected Marbella a sister after all to applaud but Marbella did not react as expected she knelt beside
[07:19:34] odra put her head against that of the corpse staying there an interminable time the surviving H matr exchanged questioning looks but dared not move what is this they were immobilized by
[07:19:48] marbella's terrifying abilities when she had od's recent past all of the new added to previous sharing Marbella stood odra as teraza Lucilla and many others throughout the Millennia had done had
[07:20:02] given her life for The Sisterhood a part of her would always remain within Marbella warning her and guiding her down the right path perhaps some bit of sea child would remain as well the matre
[07:20:16] AED by marbella's fierceness and power have no choice but to accept her as their leader as is the way of the honored matres but the Benny jzr Sisterhood is divided on their acceptance of Marbella as their leader Marbella essentially has made the first
[07:20:31] step in the joining together of the two Sisterhood she was both honored MRE and Benny jzr and because of it The Sisterhood would never be the same they would not be Benny jzr they would not be
[07:20:43] honored matre but something else back on chapter house Shana's plan has come to full fruit joined by Duncan Idaho she escaped on the no ship before merbella had a chance to stop them they take with them the
[07:20:57] young miles T sael carrying the DNA of paulet Tres Jessica and others and the sect of Jews but as they make their escape they encounter again those Duncan had seen in his
[07:21:12] Visions part 10 the ones of many faces Shana and Duncan had escaped on the no ship or so they thought they did not know that the others were still watching the man and the woman Duncan had seen
[07:21:27] through the net it is not clear who these two are or what their purpose is but Duncan had seen them many times this is where it always happened to him will it happened today without
[07:21:41] warning the sense of being in the great hold would vanish then the net shimmering in a molten Sky he was aware when the vision came that he was not really seeing a net his mind translated
[07:21:53] what the senses could not Define a shimmering net undulating like an infinite Borealis in the vision Idaho saw what he could only describe as a net but he
[07:22:06] could not exactly say what it was or where it was through the net he would eventually see a man and woman dressed in Old clothing how ordinary they appeared and yet extraordinary
[07:22:20] a grandmother and grandfather in antique clothing bib coveralls for the man and a long dress with headscarf for the woman working in a flower garden Idaho knew that during their time and the scattering the honored matre had been
[07:22:34] hunted by some power in the far reaches of the cosmos he knew that the couple were likely to be face dancers who over their time in the scattering had become independent of the Tay laxu Masters
[07:22:47] using his mtat skills Duncan projected that a Tay Mau group in the scattering must have engaged in genetic alteration creating the futar the human feline hybrids brought out of the scattering by the honored matr the two he had
[07:23:01] witnessed in the vision could be the ones who had created the futar futar of course had the ability to seek out and Destroy honored mrr they could use their voice to immobilize and render them defenseless throughout the book Chapter
[07:23:14] House dun the mrr continue to reference a mysterious group they encountered in the scattering known as the ones of many faces and it was also implied that the ones of many faces had in fact been the ones who inced the futar as a weapon
[07:23:27] against the matr and the ones of many faces cursed them through eternity had caused the disaster them and their futar the ones of many faces are almost certainly the remnants of free TXU face dancers and these two who had attempted
[07:23:42] to trap the inhabitants of the noip are obviously representatives of them they called themselves Daniel and Marty you deliberately let them get away Daniel the old woman rubbed her hands down the stained front of her garden apron it was
[07:23:57] a summer morning around her flowers blooming Birds calling from nearby trees there was a misty look to the sky a yellow Radiance near the Horizon now Marty it was not deliberate Daniel said
[07:24:10] he took off his pork pie hat and rubbed the bushy stubble of gray hair before replacing the Hat he surprised me I knew he saw us but I didn't suspect he saw the net and I had such a nice Planet picked out for them Marty said one of
[07:24:24] the best a real test of their abilities Daniel said that he never thought Idaho actually saw the net the usage of the term net itself further indicates that some kind of trap was being set and it seems that the inhabitants of the no
[07:24:38] ship at the end of chapter house just barely escaped the one called Marty mentions that they had intended to test their abilities and that they had a planet picked out for them implying that to these to the events of the dun Saga
[07:24:51] have simply been some great experiment how long had these two been watching how long had they been there the fact that Daniel and Marty are able to watch Idaho and his companions the nature of their vessel and the fact that they had
[07:25:05] planned to test them suggests that these two possess technology far greater than any scene in the novels prior to this point the fact that Daniel and Marty are face dancers of the scattering who had freed themselves continues to be heavily
[07:25:18] implied In this passage as well they had a t laxu Master with them too I saw him when they went under the net I would have so liked to study another Master don't see why Always whistling at
[07:25:30] us always making it necessary to stump them down I don't like treating Masters that way and you know it if it weren't for them they aren't Gods Daniel neither are we I still think you let them Escape
[07:25:45] you're so anxious to prune your roses what would you have said to the master anyway Daniel asked I was going to joke when he asked who we were they always asked that I was going to say what did you expect God himself with a flowing
[07:26:00] beard Daniel chuckled that would have been funny they have such a hard time accepting that face dancers can be independent of them I don't see why it's a natural consequence they gave us the power to absorb the memories and
[07:26:14] experiences of other people gather enough of those and it's personas we take Marty whatever the master should have known that we would gather enough of them one day to make our own decisions about our
[07:26:28] future and theirs Daniel and Marty became independent of their TXU Masters after absorbing enough memories as the Benny Jes Sisterhood can share the memories of others so can the face dancers but these face dancers had
[07:26:43] absorb the memories of numerous benzer sisters even which would mean that they may possess more knowledge than any single Reverend mother for eons the face dancers had been the slave class of the
[07:26:56] TXU somewhere in the scattering this pattern had broken the insucient nature of the couple's Behavior implies that they are detached from what is happening in the main Dune story they appear to have been doing whatever it is that they
[07:27:10] are doing for quite a long time have they tested other children of humanity throughout the Universe in this manner if so how many and if they are indeed as powerful as they seem they will undoubtedly catch up with the no ship
[07:27:25] and when they do what might they have planned for the inhabitants Chapter House ends as Daniel and Marty watch as the noip makes its Escape through
[07:27:36] space part 11 the lessons of Chapter House in this novel The Sisterhood contends with problems from within and without much of it set in motion by the god Emperor leato II
[07:27:50] the god Emperor had indeed been preent The Sisterhood did not deny it it was od's view however that L to the second didn't predict the future so much as he created it he had looked into the possible Futures chose what he saw fit
[07:28:04] and then locked them on that path the rabbi of the secret Jewish sect seems to possess a similar position to odra saying this he had Satan's own powers I share Their Fear of that he was not so
[07:28:18] much preent as he was a cement he fixed the shape of what he saw of course the god emperor of Dune in his mind subjected the universe to thousands of years of tyrannical rule in order to save them from themselves teaching them
[07:28:33] a lesson of why it is a bad idea for a society to put itself in the position where it can be ruled by a centralized leader one of the key arguments in the Dune series which becomes clear in God emperor of Dune and is emphasized in
[07:28:47] Chapter House Dune is an argument against calized bureaucracy it is making an argument that bureaucracies always become aristocracies after they attain commanding power Chapter House Dune uses
