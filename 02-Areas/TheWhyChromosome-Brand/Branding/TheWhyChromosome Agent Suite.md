## 1. Headline Hacker Agent
Purpose: Craft technical-biofield headlines that grab attention
Example Output:
- Primary: "Your Brain is Running Legacy Code"
- Secondary: "Why Your Consciousness Needs a System Upgrade"
- Variant: "DEBUG: Memory Leaks in Your Reality Matrix"

## 2. Tech Quote Oracle Agent
Purpose: Generate wise/humorous tech-spiritual quotes
Example Output:
- "You are running legacy code from your teenage years. Time to refactor."
- "git commit -m 'fixed karmic dependencies'"
- "Have you tried turning your consciousness off and on again? - Ancient DevOps Master"

## 3. Parallel Pattern Finder Agent
Purpose: Map technical concepts to biofield mechanics
Example Output:
- Social Media Scrolling → Consciousness Interrupts
- Memory Leaks → Energy Dissipation
- Race Conditions → Thought Patterns

## 4. Code Snippet Weaver Agent
Purpose: Create meaningful code examples that illustrate concepts
```python
class ConsciousnessRuntime:
    def __init__(self):
        self.awareness = "fragmented"
        self.focus = "needs_optimization"
        # Ancient debug notes found
```

## 5. Image Prompt Engineer Agent
Purpose: Generate prompts for relevant illustrations
Example Output:
- "A wise ancient developer in meditation pose, surrounded by floating holographic code"
- "A CPU chip emanating spiritual energy, sacred geometry patterns in the background"
- "A mystical debugging console displaying consciousness errors"

## 6. Meme Resonance Agent
Purpose: Suggest relevant memes/GIFs that enhance the content
Example Output:
- "Use 'Matrix code rain but it's actually mantras' for section transitions"
- "Insert 'programmer trying meditation at desk' GIF for relatable humor"
- "Add 'galaxy brain' meme progression for consciousness levels"

## 7. Case Study Constructor Agent
Purpose: Create relatable example scenarios
Example Output:
- "When Alex's dopamine microservices kept crashing..."
- "Jamie's implementation of quantum threading during coding sessions..."
- "Sara's consciousness garbage collection protocol..."

## 8. Flow Architecture Agent
Purpose: Design content flow and structure
Example Output:
1. Problem Introduction (Technical → Biofield)
2. Ancient Solution Reveal
3. Modern Implementation
4. Practical Integration Steps

## 9. Technical Pun Generator Agent
Purpose: Create technical wordplay and humor
Example Output:
- "Dev(a)s" instead of "Devs"
- "Om instead of Babel"
- "Reality.exe running on ancient hardware"

## 10. Integration Protocol Agent
Purpose: Create practical implementation steps
Example Output:
1. Debug existing thought patterns
2. Implement consciousness garbage collection
3. Optimize awareness microservices
4. Deploy new reality protocols

Each agent should maintain:
- Technical precision
- Spiritual authenticity
- Engaging humor
