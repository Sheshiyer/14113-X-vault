notes:
  - "This vocabulary extends controlled-vocabulary.yaml for compass readings"
  - "Primary use case: Type 5 integration (accumulation → creation)"
  - "Vocation hour daily is the core intervention"
  - "Triage should be ≤15% of attention; >40% = accumulation trap"
  - "Recreation must be body-based, not just mind-rest"
  - "The goal is not less curiosity, but channeled curiosity"
  - "Weekly compass practice prevents drift"
