# Pattern Synthesizer Skill

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Use  
**Created**: 2026-01-26

## Quick Start

Discover hidden patterns across your vault:

```bash
# Discovery research
Synthesize patterns around "consciousness + technology" with deep analysis

# Content ideation
Synthesize patterns for "biofield engineering" surface scan for quick topics

# Vault optimization
Synthesize patterns across entire vault, identify files for Resources → Projects migration

# Multi-query meta-synthesis (parallel)
Synthesize patterns across 4 queries:
- "consciousness + technology"
- "hermetic principles + engineering"
- "biofield + electromagnetics"
- "sacred geometry + MEMS"
Generate meta-pattern report
```

## What It Does

Analyzes 50-500 files to reveal:
- ✅ Emerging patterns (3-7 high-confidence patterns)
- ✅ Cross-domain connections (technical ↔ mystical bridges)
- ✅ Type-based perspectives (how different Enneagram types frame same topic)
- ✅ **Parallel multi-query meta-synthesis** for pattern-of-patterns discovery
- ✅ Actionable recommendations (MOCs, content series, research directions)

## Innovation

**Creative synthesis from accumulated knowledge** - Activates Type 5→4 integration path (analysis → unique connections).

**Three parallel modes**:
1. **Multi-query**: Analyze 4 themes simultaneously, find meta-patterns
2. **Depth-layers**: Surface + medium + deep analysis in parallel
3. **Type-perspectives**: Same topic through 4 Enneagram lenses

## Output Example

```markdown
# Pattern Synthesis: Consciousness as Programmable System

## Emerging Patterns

### Pattern 1: The "Runtime" Metaphor (87 files, 0.92 confidence)
Consciousness conceptualized as executable code across Type 5 (technical), 
Type 9 (meditative), Type 4 (mystical) perspectives.

**Key Insight**: Same metaphor, different applications → unified framework opportunity

**Actionable**:
- Create Consciousness-Runtime-MOC.md (87 files)
- Content series: "Debugging Consciousness" (8-part)
- Move 12 files Resources → Areas/Consciousness-Practice

### Pattern 2: Biofield ↔ EM Field Bridge (34 files, 0.81 confidence)
Ancient biofield practices map to measurable electromagnetic phenomena.

**Synthesis Chain**:
Hermetic Practice → Biofield Concept → Measurable EM Field → Engineerable Intervention

**Actionable**:
- Research: "Measurable Hermetic Biofields"
- Apply to Phassion wearable bioelectronics
- Create Technical-Mystical-Bridges-MOC.md

## Cross-Domain Opportunities
[New MOCs, content series, research directions]

## Type-Based Analysis
[How Type 5, 4, 9, 8 approach same topics differently]

## Recommendations
- [ ] Create 3 new MOCs
- [ ] Move 8 files Resources → Areas/Projects
- [ ] Launch content series (8 episodes)
```

## Strategic Value

**Activates Integration Paths**:
- Type 5→8: Knowledge → Action (via actionable recommendations)
- Type 5→4: Analysis → Creative synthesis (via pattern discovery)

**Reveals Hidden Value**: Your 3,565-file vault contains latent connections not yet surfaced—this skill makes them explicit.

**Differentiates Voice**: Technical AND mystical (not OR)—this skill systematically reveals that integration.
