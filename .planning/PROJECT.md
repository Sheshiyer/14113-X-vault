# PROJECT: Vault Coherence & Exploration

## Core Value
Transform the TWC Vault from a collection of notes into a high-coherence knowledge graph where every "orphan" is connected, MOCs are comprehensive, and cross-domain insights are surfaced proactively using GSD principles.

## Requirements

### Validated
- [x] Initial PARA structure (01-04) exists.
- [x] Master MOCs (Books, Health, Tech, etc.) are present in root.
- [x] `handover.json` exists but requires regular updates.

### Active
- [ ] Identify all "orphaned" files (those with no incoming links from MOCs).
- [ ] Connect high-signal orphans to relevant MOCs.
- [ ] Detect "island clusters" (related notes linked to each other but not to the main graph).
- [ ] Audit YAML frontmatter for Enneagram and PARA tags.
- [ ] Resolve "WitnessOS" vs "Tryambakam Noesis" naming drift.
- [ ] Proactively suggest new MOCs or "Bridges" between disparate topics.

### Out of Scope
- [ ] Automated content generation (focus is on structure/linking).
- [ ] Deep binary file processing (PDF/Image contents).

## Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Use GSD Mapping | Fresh context per domain prevents token rot. | — Pending |
| Phase-based approach | Start with orphans, then MOC depth, then cross-links. | — Pending |
