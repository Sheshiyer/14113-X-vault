# REQUIREMENTS: Vault Coherence & Exploration v1

## Objectives
Bridge the "Connectivity Gap" by linking orphans, consolidating MOCs, and establishing a proactive exploration protocol.

## v1 Requirements

### 🧩 Connectivity (Orphans)
- [ ] **CONN-01**: Map all files in `01-Projects/Content-Engine/` to a project-specific MOC.
- [ ] **CONN-02**: Identify top 50 "High-Signal" orphans in `03-Resources` and link to their primary Library MOC.
- [ ] **CONN-03**: Create a `System-MOC.md` to link all `_System/` agents and templates.

### 🗺️ MOC Consolidation
- [ ] **MOC-01**: Update `Books-Master-Index.md` to reflect actual current folder counts.
- [ ] **MOC-02**: Audit `Technology-Library-Index.md` for broken or missing links.

### 🔍 Proactive Exploration
- [ ] **EXPL-01**: Generate a "Cross-Link Report" suggesting 5 connections between `Occult` and `Technology` files.
- [ ] **EXPL-02**: Detect "Island Clusters" in `Archives` that should be promoted back to `Resources`.

### 🧹 Standards & Drift
- [ ] **STND-01**: Update 10 legacy "WitnessOS" files to the "Tryambakam Noesis" kernel terminology.
- [ ] **STND-02**: Append missing frontmatter to all files in `02-Areas`.

## Success Criteria
1. MOC Coverage increases from 1.1% to >5%.
2. All `Content-Engine` files are linked to a hub.
3. 0 "Broken Links" in root MOCs.
