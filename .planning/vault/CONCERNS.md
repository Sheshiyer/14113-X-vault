# CONCERNS: Vault Knowledge Debt

## Critical Debt
1. **Connectivity Gap**: 98.9% of the vault is "unmapped" to root MOCs. This makes proactive exploration difficult for agents.
2. **Archives Bloat**: `04-Archives` contains 27,000+ files but is marked as "Not currently used" in the taxonomy reference.
3. **Template Orphanage**: Core system templates are unlinked, leading to inconsistent new file creation.

## Vulnerabilities
- **Context Rot**: Agents often fail to see related research because it isn't linked via MOCs.
- **Naming Drift**: "WitnessOS" references still exist in 01-Projects, confusing current mission objectives.

## Proactive Exploration Targets
- **Bioelectric Resonance**: Linking Health → Technology.
- **Esoteric Engineering**: Linking Occult → Knowledge/Research.
- **Actionable Rituals**: Linking Daily Logs → Areas (Skills-Development).
