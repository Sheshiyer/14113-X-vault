# ARCHITECTURE: Vault Knowledge Graph

## Connectivity State
Current mapping analysis shows a massive "Disconnected" state.

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Markdown Files | 7,973 | — |
| MOC-Linked Files | 86 | ⚠️ Critical Under-linkage |
| MOC Coverage | 1.1% | 🎯 Target: >85% |
| Unlinked Files (Orphans) | 7,763 | 🧩 Massive Opportunity |

## Knowledge "Island" Clusters
High-density clusters that exist but aren't currently "piped" into the master MOCs:
- **Agents**: `_System/agent-zero-agents/` (Main agent, Sadha-orchestrator, etc.)
- **Templates**: `_System/Templates/` (Prompts, frameworks, ritual logs)
- **Projects**: `01-Projects/Content-Engine/` (Threads, articles,Substack variants)

## Discovery Vectors
Proactive exploration should focus on bridging these gaps:
1. **Vertical Integration**: Link `03-Resources` files to their parent MOCs.
2. **Horizontal Synthesis**: Find connections between `Occult` and `Technology` (Type 4 ↔ Type 5).
3. **Temporal Mapping**: Link `Daily Logs` to the projects they mention.
