- **Topics:** [[Sacred Science]], [[Spirituality]], [[Consciousness]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Philosophy]]
- **Context:** An essay discussing the nature of wholeness, the three Abrahamic covenants (Law, Love, Surrender), and a practical experiment in "bitul" (self-nullification) called "The Car Passing Trick".

## Key Points
- **Wholeness and Threes:** All whole cycles naturally come in three parts. A point models Unity; a circle models Wholeness.
- **Torus Knots:** Torus knots (specifically 3,X knots) are used to model self-organizing processes and are related to Platonic solids and symmetry groups.
- **The Three Abrahamic Covenants:**
    1.  **Jewish (Law/Learning):** Adherence to Torah/Law. Focus on mind/learning.
    2.  **Christian (Love/Empathy):** Based on Love and nurturing emotions. Focus on faith/healing.
    3.  **Muslim (Surrender/Islam):** Surrender to the will of Allah. Focus on submission.
    - All three are necessary for manifestation: Conception (Jewish), Nurturing (Christian), Birthing/Surrender (Muslim).
- **The Experiment (PaRDeS):** Spiritual experiences (like Rabbi Akiva's in PaRDeS) are subjective and require direct experience, not just description.
- **The Car Passing Trick:** A practical experiment in *bitul* (nullification of will).
    - **Goal:** To pass a slow car (e.g., "Farmer Brown") on a road where passing is difficult.
    - **Method:**
        1.  Desire to pass (Will).
        2.  Connect/Greet the driver mentally (Love/Connection).
        3.  **Completely give up** on passing and submit to following forever (Surrender/Bitul).
    - **Result:** When the will is truly nullified, the obstacle removes itself (the car pulls over).
    - **Condition:** It must be a "controlled folly" – you cannot do it *to* get the result (ego involvement). You must genuinely give up.

## Content

All whole cycles naturally come in three parts. This is because it takes 3-points (anywhere in two or higher dimensional space) to uniquely define a circle. In the sense that a point is like a seed, a circle is like its surrounding fruit. Any finite circle viewed from infinitely far away can appear to be a point, and any point examined infinitesimally (from within itself) can appear to be a circle. If we make use of a point to model *Unity,* we could make use of a circle to model a corresponding *Wholeness*. Thus it is more than coincidence that *Whole* and *hole* are pronounced the same. There is always a *hole* inside of a *Whole* circle.

Since the volume of a 2-torus in 3-dimensions has the same measure as the surface of a sphere (with appropriate radius) in 4-dimensions (a *hypersphere*), the discussion of circles as models of *Wholeness*, above, also holds for spheres and tori - even though it takes 4-points to determine a sphere in 3-dimensions and 5-points to determine a hypersphere in 4-dimensions. The simplest, lowest order Whole of this sort is an ordinary 2-dimensional circle.

### The Three Abrahamic Covenants

A covenant, for purposes of this discussion, is taken to be an "agreement with G-d"; a SELF-FULFILLING path and a self-referential PROMISE. In the west, there are three strands of faith: the Hebraic, the Christian, and the Islamic, and each has its particular covenant which gives it its continuity and sustenance.

1.  **The JEWISH covenant** is based on adherence to and understanding of the law (The Torah). The Oral Torah, the Talmud, literally means, *the learning* from the Hebrew root *Lamed-Mem-Dalet, to learn or teach.* This has led to a desire for LEARNING, and ethical behavior derived from learning, as the primary modes of relation to the world.
2.  **The CHRISTIAN covenant** is based on LOVE and empathy and therefore emphasizes the nurturing and nourishing emotions that lead to faith. Here conception is physical, and understanding of the Law (the Hebrew Bible) is less important. One can be transformed, healed, and even resurrected, by God’s love.
3.  **The MOSLEM covenant** is SURRENDER. The word *Islam* means surrender, submission or "letting go" to the will of Allah. In Islam the goal is to surrender to God’s will.

In our world today these three covenants cannot work separately. Each is a necessary step in the harmonic living unfoldment of any manifestation. When we compare these covenants to the stages in the growth of a child, it becomes obvious that all three are necessary. First the new life must be CONCEIVED (the Hebraic covenant), then the fetus must be nurtured and carried in the womb of its mother, with its parent's emotional and bodily LOVE (the Christian covenant), and finally the child must be birthed – SURRENDERED to independent life (the covenant of Islam) in the outside world.

> To manifest anything in our reality it is necessary to Think, to Feel, and to Surrender. If any one of these three is missing or out of balance with the rest, there will be no child.

### The Car Passing Trick

It is essential, if this experiment going to work, that you NOT take it seriously at first. It must be ONLY for amusement (at least at first). This is the "bitul" aspect (*bitul* is the Hebrew term for self-abnegation of will, will-less-ness, and humility). Think of it as a "controlled folly" (as Carlos Castenada put it in his works on Yaqui Indian "sorcery".)

**So, do not believe the following, just try it. If you do believe it, you are disqualified.**

The reason what you are about to do, and especially its outcome, MUST be a "folly" is because if there is any desired outcome whatsoever, your ego will be involved and you will not have nullified your will. That is not bitul.

**The Method:**

1.  **Will:** You pull up behind a slow car ("Farmer Brown"). You desire to pass. This is your will.
2.  **Love/Connection:** Actually or in your mind's eye, smile at him. Imagine you can look into his eyes through his rear view mirror. Form the thought: "Top of the morning to you, sir. Do you mind if I pass you? I would be pleased if I could."
3.  **Surrender:** Drop back a bit more. **COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY GIVE UP on EVER passing him.** Submit your will to God’s will. This step is vital and it CANNOT BE FAKED. You must nullify your will or nothing will happen. Unless you actually give up all hope and expectation of passing, and resign yourself to God's will by following Farmer Brown to the ends of the earth, nothing will happen.

**The Result:**

At the very instant when I have actually nullified my will to God's will and given up on anything happening, and I am completely resigned to follow farmer Brown forever, Farmer Brown will inexplicably pull over or turn off the road and let me pass.

This is not magic. It is the opposite of magic. Magic is based on power-tripping one's own will. The "car passing trick" is based on nullifying your will to God's will. It is a example of how a kabbalistic perspective on our traditional teachings can be instructive and helpful in real life.
