# Quantum Physics: Sensing Unbroken Wholeness

## Metadata
*   **Author:** Judith Bluestone Polich
*   **Source:** Excerpt from *Return of the Children of Light, Incan and Mayan Prophecies for a New World* (pp. 97-101)
*   **Topics:** Quantum Physics, Holographic Universe, Non-locality, Consciousness, Ancient Wisdom, Light
*   **Context:** Explores the convergence of modern quantum physics and ancient spiritual teachings regarding the nature of reality as interconnected energy and light.

## Key Points
*   **Matter is Light:** Subatomic particles (electrons) behave as both particles and waves. Matter can be viewed as "frozen light" or patterns of vibration in a morphogenetic field.
*   **The Observer Effect:** There is no objective physical reality independent of the observer. Conscious intent can alter the outcome of events (referencing Princeton PEAR lab research).
*   **Holographic Universe:** David Bohm's theory of the **Implicate Order** suggests the universe is a hologram where every part contains information about the whole.
*   **Non-Locality:** Bell's Theorem proves that subatomic particles are connected instantaneously across space (unbroken wholeness), defying the speed of light limit for information transfer.
*   **Convergence with Ancient Wisdom:** These scientific discoveries validate ancient Incan, Mayan, Buddhist, and Hindu teachings that the world is an illusion of separation and that we are fundamentally "light beings" in a unified field.
