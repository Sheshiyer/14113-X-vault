# Quantum Theories of Consciousness

## Vibrational Frequency Framework

### Seven Key Factors Affecting Vibrational Frequency
1. Thoughts
   - Emission of frequencies
   - Return patterns
   - Impact on consciousness

2. Social Environment
   - Influence of surrounding energies
   - Group consciousness effects
   - Vibrational matching

3. Sound and Music
   - Impact of different frequencies
   - Consciousness modification
   - Harmonic relationships

4. Visual Input
   - Effect of visual stimuli
   - Processing and consciousness impact
   - Environmental influence

5. Physical Environment
   - Space organization
   - Energy flow patterns
   - Environmental harmony

6. Language and Expression
   - Vibrational impact of words
   - Communication patterns
   - Consciousness modification

7. Gratitude Practice
   - Frequency elevation
   - Consciousness expansion
   - Energy flow enhancement
