# Sacred Geometry and Mathematical Principles

## Time and Sacred Numbers

### Sexagesimal System
- Base-60 cycles in ancient timekeeping
- Relationship to modern time measurement
- Connection to Sumerian knowledge systems

### Mathematical Relationships
- 432² = 186,624 (approximation of light speed in miles/second)
- Precessional cycles and ancient knowledge
- Fractal nature of time measurements

## Golden Mean and Sacred Ratios
- Spiral patterns in nature
- Connection to consciousness and perception
- Integration with sound harmonics

## Veils of Negative Existence
### Three Primary Veils
1. Ain ("Light")
2. Ain Soph ("Without Limit")
3. Ain Soph Aur ("Limitless Light")

### Qabalistic Understanding
- Pre-existence states
- Relationship to manifestation
- Connection to consciousness studies

## Research Applications
- Modern implications of ancient mathematical systems
- Integration with quantum theories
- Practical applications in consciousness studies

## Time Fractals
- Past and future extensions
- Base-60 relationships
- Connection to cosmic cycles

### Time Equation
TIME = Pi/W(Omega)+(e-1) = 137.5 (Golden Angle)
- Relationship to universe age calculations
- Integration with cosmic cycles
- Mathematical foundations of reality
