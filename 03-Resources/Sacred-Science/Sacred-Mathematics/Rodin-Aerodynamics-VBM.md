## Executive Summary
This document outlines the core principles of **Vortex Based Mathematics (VBM)** as discovered by Marko Rodin. It posits that numbers are not merely symbols but real, living entities that define the dimensional shape and function of the universe. The central discovery is a specific number pattern (**1-2-4-8-7-5**) that represents a doubling circuit and forms the geometry of a torus (donut shape). This mathematics claims to solve anomalies in standard math, reveal the "Mathematical Fingerprint of God," and offer a blueprint for unlimited free energy, advanced propulsion, and artificial intelligence.

## Key Concepts

### The Doubling Circuit (1-2-4-8-7-5)
*   **The Pattern:** By doubling numbers (1, 2, 4, 8, 16->7, 32->5, 64->1...), a repeating pattern of **1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5** emerges.
*   **Significance:** This pattern represents the flow of energy in a 3D toroidal shape. It is the "doubling circuit" or the path of electricity in a highly efficient coil.
*   **Infinity Symbol:** Tracing this pattern on a circle (Enneagram) forms an infinity symbol, representing the non-decaying flow of energy.

### The Oscillation (3-9-6)
*   **The Vector:** The numbers 3, 9, and 6 do not appear in the doubling circuit. They form a separate, higher-dimensional magnetic field.
*   **The Pattern:** 3 doubled is 6, 6 doubled is 12 (3). The 9 is the control or axis.
*   **Function:** This represents the "fourth dimension" or the magnetic field that drives the coil. The 3 and 6 oscillate (Yin/Yang), while the 9 is the "S" curve or the "Primal Point of Unity."

### The Number 9 (The Spirit)
*   **Properties:** The number 9 is the "omni dimension," representing Spirit or the Aether. It is linear, never changes (all multiples of 9 reduce to 9), and is the source of all movement and inertia.
*   **Role:** It is the "singularity" or the center of the black hole/atom from which "Aetheron Flux Monopole Emanations" radiate. It is the missing "Dark Matter."

### The Rodin Coil & Torus
*   **Geometry:** The interaction of the doubling circuit (1-2-4-8-7-5) and the oscillation (3-9-6) creates a perfect 3D toroidal grid.
*   **Applications:** This geometry is the blueprint for the **Rodin Coil**, which is claimed to produce unlimited free energy, create a propulsion drive that can travel anywhere in the universe, and model the structure of DNA and atoms.

### Aetheron Flux Monopole Emanations
*   **Definition:** Linear emanations of quasi-mass/energy traveling from the center of mass outwards.
*   **Function:** They are the "Life Force," responsible for all form, movement, and gravity (via "Negative Draft Counterspace"). They activate the number groups on the torus skin in a phased array sequence.

## Critical Analysis / Notes
*   **Scientific Standing:** The text presents highly esoteric and metaphysical claims that are not recognized by mainstream physics or mathematics. It blends numerology with physical concepts (torus, black hole, DNA).
*   **Religious Context:** The work is heavily influenced by the **Bahá'í Faith**, specifically the numerical value of the "Most Great Name of God" (Abha) which equates to 9.
*   **Claims:** The document makes extraordinary claims about "unlimited free energy," "man-made black holes," and "time travel" without providing empirical evidence or engineering schematics in this text.

## Related Concepts
*   **Enneagram:** The 1-4-2-8-5-7 pattern is a well-known sequence in the Enneagram of Personality (Gurdjieff/Ouspensky), which Rodin adapts for his physical theory.
*   **Sacred Geometry:** The torus and the number patterns are presented as fundamental geometric truths underlying reality.
*   **Nikola Tesla:** The emphasis on 3, 6, and 9 echoes Tesla's famous quote about the significance of these numbers.
