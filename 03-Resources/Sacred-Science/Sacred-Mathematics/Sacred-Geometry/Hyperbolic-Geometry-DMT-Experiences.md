# Hyperbolic Geometry of DMT Experiences

## Metadata
*   **Source:** Transcript of a talk by Andrés Gómez Emilsson (Qualia Research Institute)
*   **Topics:** DMT, Hyperbolic Geometry, Phenomenology, Consciousness, Symmetry, Neural Annealing
*   **Context:** A detailed technical and phenomenological breakdown of DMT states using the framework of hyperbolic geometry and complex systems theory.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Hyperbolic Geometry & Perception
*   **Curvature:** Unlike flat (Euclidean) or spherical (positive curvature) space, hyperbolic space has **negative curvature** (saddle shape).
*   **Branching Factor:** In hyperbolic space, the amount of space increases exponentially with radius (unlike quadratic in Euclidean). This allows for "more space" to fit information.
*   **Botany Analogy:** Kale leaves curl because they grow faster than Euclidean space allows, forcing them into hyperbolic shapes to accommodate the surface area.

### 2. The Six Levels of DMT Experience
1.  **Threshold:** Crisp, high-definition vision. Lower "copying threshold" for symmetries.
2.  **Chrysanthemum:** 2D Euclidean "wallpaper" symmetries cover surfaces.
3.  **Magic Eye:** A depth map emerges from the texture, encoding semantic content.
4.  **Waiting Room:** Space itself becomes hyperbolic. Appearance of "Hyperbolic Honeycombs" and higher-dimensional symmetries.
5.  **Breakthrough:** Extreme curvature. "Impossible" geometries (e.g., seeing a lattice as a single cell).
6.  **Amnesia:** Energy/curvature is so high that the system becomes "memoryless" (like boiling rocks melting crystals).

### 3. Energy-Complexity Landscape
*   **Mapping States:** Experiences can be mapped on axes of **Energy** (dose/intensity) and **Information/Complexity**.
*   **Sweet Spot:** "Maximum useful information" lies between pure order (crystals) and pure noise (chaos).
*   **Trajectory:** The "trip" is a trajectory through this landscape.

### 4. Neural Annealing
*   **Metaphor:** Heating a metal (brain) to high energy (entropy) to allow it to self-organize into a more consonant, lower-energy state upon cooling.
*   **Therapeutic Value:** "Melting" rigid constraints (trauma, fixed thought patterns) to allow for new configurations and healing.

### 5. Future of Psychonautics
*   **Super Shulgin Academy:** A proposed institution for rigorous, high-quality training and research in consciousness, combining philosophy, phenomenology, and chemistry.
