Source: Find hidden gold mines that make you money (01j2wp8rk6av2dr4mj890yn6x9).html

in this video I'm going to show you a
method to go really deep into Reddit to
find sub niches that you would never
have thought of so you can either sell
your existing product to New Markets or
you can go through the same method to
find problem specific problems and
specific niches to create new Solutions
I first thought of creating a video
where I conduct a complete market
research but it would have been so long
so I just I'm just going to walk you uh
through all the different steps so you
can do it for yourself and here are the
different steps so let me put myself a
little bit uh
smaller so what we are going to do we
are just going to talk about what are we
searching exactly and then there is Step
One is research and Discovery so
basically we use um a chpt or Cloud to
come up with different ideas um to start
the research with then we use Ena which
you have seen here to find out different
subreddits um that are hidden within
other subreddits and then when we find
something interesting we will use
subredit stats which is um which will
give us a lot of insight about specific
subreddit and we would go on Amazon
Google Trend um we would use gigabrain
which is uh a tool that is using Reddit
and AI to come up with different
insights and we are going to look at
what we can do next to find more um
informations uh and especially we are
going to use EXA at the end which is a
brand new AI tool that is making
research based on the meaning and not
the text on your your research so it's
very interesting but it's quite new so
we are going to look at it um at the end
of the video and we are going to uh
check out how we can get Market
statistic very easily using gini or
perplexity and and there is a Next Step
that I am going to give you at the end
of the video so if you up for it I will
try to make it short as possible U but
as complete as possible so let's go into
it the first thing I want to point out
is what are we looking for we are
looking for niches niches are group of
people who all have the same specific
problem or need and to be clear you can
have two different things but the most
important part is the same specific
problem on need because if you find a
problem big enough then you can find
different group of people that have the
same
problems but your problem need to be big
enough so we first look at the pram then
we look at how many people are looking
are into this program and then if if it
is big enough we uh segment into um
different categories all right let's
start right away way why am I using chat
GPT or Cloud this is because I have this
uh prompt which I'm not going to read
but basically ask for if I give you um
the quick description of my product I
come up with um keywords I can use to
Kickstart my research in ways that I
would not have thought of so let's first
uh activate this prompt and for that I'm
going to copy it first
and I'm going to open clo because I
prefer clo than CH GPT and I'm using po
because I'm in Europe so I canot use clo
don't know
why and here is the the example so
that's a product um I got as an example
uh that's a course that teaches easy
gentle exercise focused on slow movement
and relaxation technique helps with
issues like like this grinding headache
from Bad posture blah blah blah that is
that is an existing product by the way
but it's just a short description of
what it does so it just gives us an
example to start with so I give the
complete description and then we go so
that's our first
step all
right let's go with chronic
pain because that is or even stica stica
I think because I cannot know that um it
will fit well to our example even though
we are not doing the complete uh
research for this product but it's just
to to get something interesting so here
I am on uh on CA which is a g project
and here I can type a keyword and it
will find the different sub edits that
are related to this keyword so I'm going
to SAA and then I'm looking at what is
there what is related to it so basically
this one doesn't seem to be that big uh
we
can check it out it's not
even if I click here it opens the
subreddit and oh I have
31k okay let's say let's see let's say I
want to find something different so I'm
going to it it is linked to chronic pain
so if I click here then now it opens
chronic pain which is here in the center
and I can see here sciatica back pain
and so on and what do I have more that I
can use
um let's wait a second let's go with
posture since it was our product
already posture what do we have Auto
proing scis so you can check out
different um you will find probably
things you don't know and those are the
best ones you want to check for the the
sake of this video I'm not going to do
that but for example here I would check
like TMG um which I think is related to
the the jaw um pelvic floor I know it
Without Really knowing what it is um but
yeah this is what you want to do you
want to analyze everything and and go
and find things that are um that are
interesting um here Mig how big is that
one because it was uh in the description
of our product already so and it is an
easy one so we are Mak making sure the
example I will show you after are good
with that um headache from Bad posture
so we have
migraine and we can start with that so
let's say I want so sorry I was already
there how big is
migran
all right so we already have
137,000 members on the subredit migr
that's a good start so what do we do
next we are going to take this one but
obviously everything I'm going to show
you you can repeat it with every uh
subreddit you start with at the
beginning but let's go with this
one so we are done with the research and
Discovery now we are we want to go with
quick validation and the first thing is
quite easy we are just going to
get the name of the subreddit and we go
to subreddit stats which will gives us
which would give us sorry stats uh about
this specific
subreddit but be careful here you can
read the disclaimer um since Reddit has
um blocked blocked the API um it's more
likely an accurate um during the last
month but it doesn't matter this is not
what we want we just just want a quick
overview of what is going on here so
even though it's not completely accurate
we are not looking at precise accurate
numbers we just want to see the growth
of the the subit and that U is is
actually correct uh I think at least so
maybe the only thing I would look at is
subscribers and for you to know um if
you go here you will find all um
subreddit growing because it is quite um
um most of the people are not
unsubscribing to subredit so it's mostly
growing you just want to know how fast
is growing and now you can see that uh
it started like the gross really started
in 2018 and since then is kind of uh
time 10 um so that that's a solid growth
um so that's a first good example you
can look at all of that but this exactly
I think is not really precise right now
so let's move on to the next step of
validation here I want to use Amazon
specifically Amazon books and then we
are looking at different Trends but
first we want to know if there is a
market and let's go to Amazon books for
the sake of the video I'm using
amazon.com but in this case that's the
moment if you're in another country for
example if you're in Germany then use
amazon.de and you type um the equivalent
of migran in German so now I'm going to
just type
migran and look at the
results VES micr injection plan foiling
okay so what I'm looking at right now is
first all they books about the topic if
there are books it means that people
have
progr are the books selling well you
know that simply by looking at how many
comments uh how many reviews um is there
migr all right
um so that sounds like a real problem
indeed I mean that's not
uh that was quite obvious but you can
see already that you find a bunch of uh
of books written on the topic I wouldn't
say it's is huge the the amount of
review but it is it it is fair enough so
we have that now we said we are going to
look at Google
transs and here quick tip I'm going to
show you the first thing I do um I
always start worldwide and um I put here
the
maximum um from 2004 because it gives us
an overview you can go deeper later if
you want but
gr okay so here I'm having the search
ter okay that's a solid
one it is growing slowly but it is
growing generally I'm also going for the
different um topics that are related
because if you look at search term you
will always find um a um curve um a
graphic that is made from the search
like not only people looking for this
exact keyword but also people for
looking for things um um that are
associated but when you use topics the
first thing it does this one is genetic
disorder I'm not sure it's the right one
but let's try it yeah it is similar but
the first thing it will do is that it
will also include a lot of different
Insight information that Google knows
not only the search and you can also use
that normally do more all the time but
for example if I'm using France
okay that's the same world in France
actually so that's fine but
Germany I guess not the same word okay
and if I use now search
term okay that's another thing uh
interesting here when you see curve like
that it means that there are a lot of up
and down which means it is
not the the more linear is the curve the
higher is the the volume of search so
probably you would look for a different
world uh if you would look there I'm not
going to do all the countries I think
you you got the point you can play with
Worldwide a country uh and either the
search ter or the the topic depending on
what you are searching okay but now the
problem is I know that it is growing and
that's a good thing but I don't know how
many people are looking for that so how
do I know that you can use a lot of
keyword research tool but there is one
that is that has good free plan and that
you can use right away here and it is
called
Glimpse if you don't know it uh it is
basically um Chrome application that you
can use to display the volume of search
directly in Google Trend so I already
have the application and I'm going to
set up
now okay so it
is sorry where is it here cimps so you
can see it's here you just have to sign
up and create your account and then you
can go back and now that is it is set up
I refresh and here I have 10 10 uh free
search now it is using Glimpse and you
will see that is looking for FR oh wow
that's a big one for a lot of for all
the searches so now you have the volume
for example let's take France as an
example since it's the same world uh it
is a good way to to test it
out okay so for example I have for
France and migraine I know if my product
um can solve this problem I know that I
have a solid curve that is growing plus
I have more than 30,000 search per month
so that's a very good Market to go
into all right I think now you got the
point so if we go back to our um method
we went for a first research and
Discovery to find out things we didn't
thought about then we went on and gave
us to dig into different subreddits and
find one that we haven't thought of then
we made a quick um um check on subredit
stats to see how big how fast it was
growing in the last years then we
checked if there is some demand in
Amazon books um you can also by the way
use Amazon um normally like not Amazon
books to see if there are products
related to the to your problem to your
Market um and how much are they
selling and then we went on Google trans
and we used glimps to find out one the
how growing is the market and two the
the volume of search that we can find
per country or worldwide now let's go to
the last step which is deep analysis and
the first tool we are going to use is
gigabrain and that's quite new tool I
actually which is really interesting
uh okay where am I here okay
search what it does it is that it is
connected to um reddits and it does
research and um analyze the search of
the different posts is it finds and
summarize it with AI which saves us a
lot of time so for example migraine deal
dealing with migraine
TDR migraine is not just about headache
but
where Okay so this first sentence is
already interesting if we think of our
product um migraine is not just a bad
headache but a wave of electrial
activities in the brain that cause virus
symptom um that is more like a systemic
problem um so it's probably not a doctor
but there is a marketing way to to link
it to uh to a product that is solving
like muscle
relaxation I don't know if it works but
uh what do we
have migraine alert dogs that's very
interesting I didn't know it exist I
would definitely look into that not for
our example do but it's an interesting
Market virtual reality um M trigger
migrant I know that I am a huge fan of
VR and a lot of people are experimenting
that
whatever that's not the topic migraine
alert dogs and so on okay same Principle
as we had when we were looking at that
you can dig into it uh and this is where
you start finding gold like things you
wouldn't have S of after um ana and also
what you can do is that you see all the
subreddits that were um where they found
most of the the post and you can service
dog Oculus do that's for you can um for
example if I click on this one I will
find the summary for this specific
subreddit so yeah you can go ahead and
type different keywords or directly the
name of subreddits and and dig um deeper
into each topic into each branch of the
topic that you want to dig
in okay let's uh go to The Next Step
which is meta ads Library why so first
if you don't know what it is meta is
Facebook ads basically and there is a
free tool that allows us to look at uh
What uh ads are running right now and
where running before and that's a very
interesting way
to see what our company's setting and
how how good it works okay so we have
nothing
no we have we have a bunch of things
okay
uh how can
I so the goal here is to find product
that are directly related to what you
are looking at and see if there are ads
running for a long time so there is
directly a migrant thatc migrant
supports migrant support here okay so
let's look at this one so that's an
active
ad and if I go
to this ad I don't know if I can
directly go to
the
okay if I go to migrant
supports
about page
transparency page is correct running ads
we know that already we go to library
didn't know how to jump from one to
another but now I'm seeing only their
ads and then I can look
at no that's probably that's a quite
recent ad so that's a bad example
actually they don't have more ads than
that what I'm looking for is ads that
are running since one or two or three
years that is a very good sign obviously
in our example migraine it's it is a big
product and you can find um different um
ads that are in this case that are
running I think if we look for it we
would find them but that is not
obviously the case depending on what
you're searching for so what I'm just
going to show you is that if you have
done already uh if you are at this step
and you you start seeing like finding
program you've never thought of before
and then you go on the Facebook ad
library and you you find products that
are selling for this specific produ um
pain since a long time or maybe not if
it's a new problem let's say um then
that's a good sign but this is one more
step to go to to find Insight on your
Market all right let's go to the next
one which is
EXA what is EXA that's actually that's
the newest one I think um I I found out
about it like 3 days ago so I'm not
completely familiar with it um but what
it does is it understands the concept
beyond beyond the keywords you type so
if you are technical it uses I think
Vector database to really associate
meaning of words rather than
associating um words simply it's not
simple and from there as I said I'm not
completely familiar but it it works
quite well so if I'm typing
companies solving
migraine
problems and I'm searching let's see
what it says but obviously it struges
that was a bad
example
um stic PR just for
the sake of the
example okay so if I'm not in my grand I
just put this one so we don't have the
drugs as
example PA in the approach to treating
sciatic pain so we directly start having
companies that are specifically solving
this kind of program and then you can
look for news PDF paper and all that
good stuff that you can find here I'm
not sure it is um having the whole
internet as a database but honestly so
far far every time I looked for
something I found really interesting
Insight that I couldn't have find uh EAS
on Google probably on the um on the 10
page in Google so yeah definitely uh wor
giving it a go and deepened your
research on this
website okay and one more step that we
can take is to find statistics and to
understand market growth based on um
research that have been done already and
for that I have a simple prompt that you
can just copy and past and we are using
two tools uh which are perplexity and
gini gini is the the Google AI and
perplexity is an AI that is specifically
made for research on the internet why we
are not using CH GP in Cloud simply
because those are large language model
that are um
TR Market again valuated okay now you
can start seeing different insights on
what you found obviously it has to be a
big Market uh it's not small paint that
you will find statistic on um and then
you can look at the different Insight if
you click on the links uh you can
continue digging a little bit deeper and
analyze every link you can do the exact
same thing uh within Germany but I
figure that is not as good uh in term of
statistic it just gives you an overview
basically let's see what it says I know
give some statistic not
bad Market show
unfortunately okay you get the points
and that is for
the the one more step how do I find
actual studies that are backing up what
I'm looking at
and not studies but market
research okay we are now at the end of
this um three-step research and I
already hope that you Lov how you found
some value and it was uh interesting if
it's the case the only thing I ask you
is please um like this video and
tell whatever you want to tell in the
comments uh or if you have any question
because it will definely help the video
to be seen by more people it's a lot of
work and unfortunately YouTube is not
really pushing my videos so I would
really appreciate that uh let me show
you one more step that is still related
to um to Reddit uh which is really
interesting it is from Greg Eisenberg
and this is the ultimate ultimate G to
un unbundling Reddit it is not about
market research specifically but it is a
very good guide um that you can use for
when you have found something on Reddit
how do you create a business from it I
really like it I really like his
approach so I definitely suggest you
check that out and that's it for this
video if you are in the process of
either validating a product finding
inside finding your product Market fit
or if you want to launch a new product
there is one um approach that almost
always works course is quiz funet and
this is mostly what I do and I have
created a video a while ago that shows
you um is specifically for e-commerce
but it shows you everything or at least
a lot of the things you can do with quiz
funnels um and I am going to create more
videos on this topic but first check
that one and if you are um uh interested
in that probably you should subscribe to
this channel because are more are to
come hope you like the video and I wish
you a good day bye-bye
