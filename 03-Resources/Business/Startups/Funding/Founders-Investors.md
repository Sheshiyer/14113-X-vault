Jason Curry
Founder of
Comigo
Raizer is easily the #1 tool for startups that are raising venture capital funding. The list building feature is a great time-saver, simplifying the search for the right investors with filters for focus area, stage, lead status, and investment size. The platform provides detailed profile pages with multiple contact options. It’s affordable and fairly priced. And it’s effective, I’ve been able to book 18 investors meetings through cold outreach. Nothing else out there measures up, Raizer is just that good.
Fedor Panteleev
Founder of
Kreo
Great product. In 2 minutes, I got a list with a bunch of investors precisely for my product whom I didn't find while researching Crunchbase.
Vladimir Makarov
Co-founder of
Emonomy
From the selected funds from Raizer, we received: out of 455 contacts, 443 were added on LinkedIn, 30% responded to email, and we scheduled calls with 5 funds.

Sizze
If you've ever had to raise money, you know how tough it is. But what's super cool about Raizer is that it lets me get in touch with tons of relevant investors in just a few minutes, so I can reach out to investors without spending a bunch of time or money. I've used other platforms before, but they're either way more expensive or don't even have this feature.
Cheryl LeBarr
Co-founder of
MADE
We’re big fans of using AI as a tool to help us move faster, and elevate what we’re doing on a daily basis. Cold emailing VC's used to take up hours of my day crafting the perfect personalized emails to get noticed. Even spending all that time we were barely getting any first meetings. Since we started using Raizer to accelerate our Pre-Seed raise we have noticed a big increase in our cold email success rate, leading to booking meetings and way less stress on my already full plate as a founder.

Monosnap
I have been beta testing this product for a few days now and I am in love! This is a must-have tool for any startup founder who is raising money 🙌
Anthony Rose
Co-founder of
SeedLegals
I couldn't believe how easy it was to use Raizer to not just find investors, but show their LinkedIn and email address AND use AI to compose a message to them (which you can edit first). It's a game changer for investor outreach.
Duncan Stuart
CEO & Founder of
Skibby
I highly recommend Raizer for its user-friendly interface and excellent support. As a first-time fundraiser, it was the perfect platform to filter out suitable investors and initiate connections. Your potential investors either exist in their database or not at all.
