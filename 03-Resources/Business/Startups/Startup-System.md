You've been with me and
@rohanrecommends
through out eight StartOS module launches over two months, and we really appreciate the support and the love! I'm super excited to finally launch the system that took us a year to build for my startup Seamless XR! Thanks
@kevin
for hunting StartOS and your vote of confidence! StartOS was designed to solve
two major pain points
I had as a founder:
1. Expensive SaaS tools that are not really affordable for us
2. Fragmentation of information across applications, leading to time leakage
After trying multiple tools, we finally switched to Notion because it gave us the flexibility to build what we needed.
🆕We've now added AI Features to do what your SaaS tools do!
