Diversity and Inclusion
We are a diverse team, remote and globally distributed.
We strategically bring different perspectives together to create a better working environment wherever everyone can feel at home. Diversity is not only about nationality, gender or age - but to have perspectives from a variety of backgrounds; culture, education, experience, age, hobbies, expertise and any other aspect that we bring to the table.
No egos philosophy. We believe that the best idéa, solution or concept should win. This is an important part of our culture where everyone is invited and everyone's voices are heard.
By building a diverse team we believe that we ultimately build a better product for our customers. As a team we have more fun and have the possibility to exchange ideas and learn from each other along the way.
