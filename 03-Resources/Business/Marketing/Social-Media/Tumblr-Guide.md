28 Pitching Essentials
28 Pitching Essentials
Michael Parker
If you are like many people, even the thought of delivering a speech in front of an audience will get your palms sweating. The fear of public speaking ranks high among the most common phobias, and for good reason: most of us approach the situation with the wrong mindset, which in turn makes us live out our worst fears in a public forum. As Michael Parker notes in IT’S NOT WHAT YOU SAY: How to Sell Your Message When It Matters Most (A TarcherPerigee paperback; on sale January 2016), our fixation on the content of our words – and not the presentation of ourselves – is what brings us down. Once the Vice-Chairman of London’s Saatchi & Saatchi, and one of the world’s most experienced advertising pitch men, having made more than 1,000 pitches in his successful career, Parker has learned first-hand that an effective presentation, a job interview, or even a speech at a wedding hinges on our ability to portray ourselves as passionate, relatable, and collected. But, if we are focused on what we say, and not how we act, we will fail to persuade our audience. Applied in the boardroom, at the pulpit, or even in conversation, these tenets will help you present better in any situation.

Psychological Safety to Build Great Products by King SVP of Product.pdf
Psychological Safety to Build Great Products by King SVP of Product.pdf
Product School
The document discusses how to build psychological safety for product managers to create great products. It recommends providing structure and clarity around company vision and strategy, the problem being solved, team purpose and organization structure. It also suggests aligning on impact goals and measuring team effectiveness, building trust within and for teams, and adding the key ingredient of psychological safety. Psychological safety allows product managers to take risks without fear of negative consequences.
The Hierarchy of Engagement
Building an enduring, multi-billion dollar consumer technology company is hard. As an investor, knowing which startups have the potential to be massive and long-lasting is also hard. From both perspectives, identifying companies with this potential is a combination of “art” and “science” — the art is understanding how products work, and the science is knowing how to measure it. At the earliest stages of a company, it comes down to understanding how a product is built to maximize and leverage user engagement. In this presentation, Sarah Tavel shares her "Hierarchy of Engagement" framework she uses to evaluate non-transactional consumer companies she is looking to invest in.
