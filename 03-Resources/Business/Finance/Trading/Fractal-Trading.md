all right thank you
we're here today to talk about trading
in some ways to increase our efficiency
at trading and make more money at
trading one of the things I'd like to
pose with you first is a real problem
that we have in trading and if we can
solve this problem then we're a long way
along the way to understanding the
market better and the trading better one
of the first part of this problem is
that you as a group as a group of
traders are in the top 10% intelligence
wise of the entire nation we're in the
top category as a group that doesn't
mean that every one of us is in there
but as a group we're in the top 10
percentile most of the people who come
to trading commodities have already been
successful and that's a second
characteristic of it and that's number
two is that we've had previous success
and then the third thing that we have
yes okay yeah we'll lower those so you
can see them better the third thing that
we have unless you have found a broker
that I haven't found yet who will open
up a an account on a credit card you
have to have accumulated some kind of
amount of money so there are three
things then you're in the top 10% you
have success previous success and you
have money and guess what that ends up
at that ends up as over 90% failure in
fact the average trader coming into the
market is blown out and a little bit
more than three months if we can
understand this then we can go a long
way in understanding how to make money
in the markets and how to trade the
market Einstein Albert Einstein toward
the end of his life was asked a question
by fellow scientists and the question
they D was asked is what is the most
important question we could possibly ask
and I'm they thought that Einstein was
going to ask that say that something
about the unified field theory which was
what he was working on that particular
time but his answer is intriguing
without any hesitation he said the most
important question you can ever ask is
is the universe a friendly place and
today the question I hope we can ask
after this is over is is the market a
friendly place let me give you a
Challenge right now you have your
pencils and paper there what I'd like
you to do is to take a second or two and
write down on that piece of paper what
what animal personifies the market to
you assume that I have just landed from
Mars I don't know anything about the
market but I want to become a
commodities trader and I come to you and
I say well what is it like you know I
know animals I've been out on the farm
what animal does the market personify to
you okay somebody give me an answer a
500-pound gorilla okay a wolf
an eagle okay Garth Godzilla what else
a female whoa I won't get into that one
okay what else anybody have a different
one a cow Oh a Tasmanian Devil what's
what's characteristic about all of this
unpredictable unfriendly exactly its
unfriendly its threatening and we come
to the market and this is a threatening
thing and we're supposed to relax and
make money and trade well and and one of
the problems that we have is that in
trading the market we oftentimes come in
with a lot of fear and because we have
that fear our mind doesn't quite work
the way it should and we don't trade the
market the way it should
today we're going to look at a very
different map a very different way of
looking at the market and the first
thing we need to understand is exactly
what is the market it's not a Tasmanian
devil it's not Godzilla it's not a
female it's really not all these things
the market is very simple and I'd like
to share with you a very simplistic kind
of a comic book example of what the
market really is most of you remember
the Flintstones remember we had two
leading characters in there we had Fred
and the other guy's name was Barney and
Fred was sort of an outgoing guy a
dinosaur hunter and a real he-man and
Barney was more the the academic
laid-back research guy who likes to live
in his backyard and Barney like to carve
dinosaur clubs and and free I'd like to
go out it likes to go out and hunt
dinosaur so one day Fred goes out he he
really hits the jackpot he brings home
two dinosaurs and he's dressed those
dinosaurs and he's got all these
dinosaur whoppers in his freezer and he
notices that his club is kind of wearing
out it's not too good and he looks over
at his neighbor's yard
Barney and Barney's got this brand-new
club so Fred gets an idea and he goes
over to the fence he says Barney I tell
you what I'll do I'll give you two big
platters of dinosaur whoppers if you'll
give me that club and Fred thinks about
it and he thinks well if I get those two
platters of dinosaur whoppers I won't
have to go hunting for a couple of three
weeks I'll feed my family everything
okay Fred you've got a deal now they
have created a commodities market and
there's no commodities market in the
entire world that's really more
complicated than that they have a lot
more computers a lot more screens and
then Fred and Barney had but that's a
commodity market a commodity market very
simply is a a process or a place that's
designed specifically to find that point
where there's an equal disagreement of
value and an agreement on price for
example the last car that you bought you
gave somebody either your money or your
credit to get the car because that car
was more important to you than that
money now to the other side of that deal
your money was more important to the
person you bought the car from and you
made a deal and you created a commodity
market and again repeating that a
commodity market is nothing more any
market is nothing more than a place
where you haven't your job is to find
that place where there's an equal
disagreement on value and an agreement
on price now that being true let's let's
examine that and see if we can take it a
little bit further if that is true we
can greatly simplify our approach to the
market making money and you heard this
before making money in the markets is
really very simple not necessarily easy
but simple and commodity markets are
very simple now as a commodity market
and they're very efficient I mean they
find this place whether it's outcry or
computer matching or whatever before you
know it before I know it before the guys
and gals on the floor know it it happens
automatically it will be right at that
point all the time if that's true then
we can throw out a lot of things first
thing we can throw out is a concept of
bullish and bearish consensus because
basically there is no such thing the way
that works is simply this I will go out
and I will survey some people I'll
survey these four people over here
what's your opinion on gold you like it
you like it you like it you don't like
it then I write up a text and it says
that there is a 75% bullishness in gold
now all that means is I haven't surveyed
all the bears because there can't be 75%
there can't be 50.1% bullishness in the
gold if there were it would have already
gone up in price so if we can throw out
bullish and bearish consensus we can
throw out some other things we can throw
out the entire concept of oversold
overbought because it's really not there
the markets are designed specifically so
that there cannot be oversold overbought
we had a person come to a tutorial who
said bill you're absolutely crazy there
is such a thing and I said how do you
know and he says because they have an
oscillator for it and how could I have
an oscillator for it if it's not really
there and so we had to spend a little
bit more time with them to explain it
but that's really true there is no such
thing as oversold overbought the markets
are designed specifically to make sure
that that doesn't happen so we can
simplify it that way we can also
simplify a lot of money management that
you read and one of the things that
that's very common particularly with new
traders is that they will tell you as
soon as you call the broker the same
telephone call don't hang up the phone
when you put in the order you put in
what else a stop right and they'll say
well if you're trading the bonds put
your stop in five hundred dollars away
don't ever take more than a $500 risk
and this in the in the bonds and if you
do that's okay but you need to
understand that you have nothing to do
with the market you're not trading the
market you're trading your wallet and
one of the one of the most inappropriate
questions in our opinion that you could
ask at the end of the day in trading is
did we make money today that's totally
irrelevant from our point of view the
only question that that is legal at the
end of a trading day is was I in tuned
with the market if you're using a $500
stop you're not in tune with the market
because you're trading your bank account
and you're trading your wallet and one
of the problems that really gets us and
we're going to get into how to use this
very shortly but before we do we need to
look at the maps that we use for trading
and one of the problems in technical
analysis
and let me state quite frankly my
opinion and this is my opinion technical
analysis does not work I don't know how
in the world
anybody can espouse technical analysis
when 90% of all the technical analysts
lose money consistently now if you were
a plastic surgeon and 90% of your
patients were uglier than when you
started on them you're not going to be
in business very long technical analysis
is not bad it just doesn't work and
here's the reason it doesn't work what
happens is you have these smart people
coming in the top 10% IQ they come into
the market they've been successful in
most everything they've ever done they
try to trade or they start trading and
they lose money and then what what do we
do well we pull out the charts and we
say well yesterday or last week or last
month or last year if I had done this
and this and this I would made a lot of
money so they said okay if I would
continue to do this maybe I'll make a
lot of money they go to the past and
they make a template of the past and
then they try to fit that template on to
the future unfortunately it doesn't work
as a matter of fact the better it worked
in the past the more for sure it's not
going to work in the future the
underlying assumption is not accurate
it's a false underlying assumption and
that underlying assumption is that the
future will be like the past and if
there's any one thing I have learned in
36 years of trading is that the path the
future is not going to be like the past
the SP is not what it was a year ago and
my conclusion is not going to be next
year what it is this year the currencies
last year we're crazy wild and wonderful
to us the currencies are good to us this
year but not they're not crazy wild and
wonderful to us this year so the
underlying assumption behind technical
analysis again in our opinion is false
we're using the wrong map it's exactly
the same thing and right now as we're
talking there's a very very good
football game college football game
going on between number two and number
four so we will cut this short so we go
to the football game later but it's like
playing a football game where you
outline every play you're going to make
during the whole game before the game
starts now how successful do you think a
football team would be that way wouldn't
be successful at all no you'd be kicking
at the wrong time throwing at the wrong
time but that's what technical analysis
does it takes this template from the
path
and tries to impose it on the future and
it doesn't work it Luck's out every now
and then but it doesn't work so what
we're doing as a group of traders the
90% of us that lose is that we're using
the wrong map and let me explain what I
mean by that about 20 22 years ago a
university in Texas did a research study
this is a little bit weird research
study they spent three million dollars
on this and they asked two questions if
all of the animals in the world have the
same intelligence that human beings have
but they have the same physiology so a
grasshopper still a grasshopper here but
it has the brains of a human and a cow
is still a cow but it has the brains of
a human and all of the animals at once
went out to look for water search for
water what would be the first animals to
find it and what would be the last
animals now all of these real smart
professors and researchers could not
decide on what animal would be the first
but do you have any idea what they all
agreed unanimously without one exception
what animal would be the last to find
water
anybody fish fish would be the last to
find water because fish don't know
anything else I mean you're sitting here
and I'm up here and what we think
normally is there's nothing between us
right but there's a whole ocean of stuff
that's going on between us and just as a
fish though they can't see the water or
don't notice the water we don't notice
what's going on and this is because of
the classical scientific heritage we
have what's going to kill you and I what
we're going to die of if we don't get in
an accident or have some tragic disease
we're going to die of gravity gravity is
going to kill us in the end and we don't
ever talk about gravity do we but we
talk about the weather all the time and
what if we what if we were out of
gravity for say 2-3 minutes every every
24 hours we wouldn't talk about the
weather
we talk about gravity where'd you go
last night well I went to Mars and then
came back to Venus and you know it went
around here but we don't talk about
gravity because it doesn't change we
talk about the weather because it
changes we talk about the market because
it's changing the market is exciting
because it changes
we live in a logic ocean and what we
think about determines how we trade and
one of the assumptions that we operate
under when we trade and one of the
assumptions that I think is true is that
you don't trade the market I don't trade
the market the institutions don't trade
the market
none of us trade the market we all trade
our personal belief systems and chaos
when we talk about chaos we'll
understand how this affects our trading
now our current logic system came down
from an old guy about 2,500 years ago by
the name of Aristotle and Aristotle
seduced the whole world by saying if you
don't know something the best thing you
can do is to go to somebody who knows
more than you and ask them now that
sounds very logical destiny I mean our
whole all of our society is built on
that medicine is built on that with its
double-blind studies law is built on
that with its precedence and what cases
we we had before and schools are
certainly built on that right you go to
school to let somebody tell you you're
either right or wrong right and then you
want to get more right so you you change
everything to please the teacher if
you're a freshman in college you're
probably very ignorant and when the
history professor tells you to go home
and read 10 pages like an idiot you go
home and read 10 pages then you become a
sophomore and somebody Clues you in you
don't study the books you study the
professors you give their professors
what they want and that's how you get by
and what you do is you lose your own
thinking and you lose your own
creativity
well Aristotle came down through the
ages with this and and his picture of
the world was a very smooth running
world and anything that didn't fit in
this picture was either a measurement
error or it was random there was another
guy who lived at the same time as
Aristotle and I don't know how many of
you have ever heard of his name but his
name was Heraclitus Heraclitus had a
very different view the most famous
saying Heraclitus probably is that you
can't step in the same river twice and
Heraclitus had a student by the name of
clay itis who went further than that
Heraclitus says when you step in the
river and pull your foot out and you go
right back in not only has your the
river change but your foot has changed
also clay itis his student went further
than that
cleitus says you can't step in the same
river once that in the process of
stepping in it it changes so on the one
side we have the smooth running
Euclidean Newtonian world and on the
other side we have this Heraklion world
everything goes very smoothly through
Galileo Descartes all of these people
Newton
yeah and and comes down to about 1911
and some little short guy comes out of
the woodwork and upsets the whole apple
cart and his name was Einstein and he
came in and he introduced a concept
called relativity the special theory and
the general theory up to that time
science classical science said therefore
things were working with we're working
with mass energy space and time and
Einstein said space and time are really
the same thing guys there's no
difference and any self-respecting
physicists in the last 90 years doesn't
mention the word time without a hyphen
in space or space with a hyphen in time
and he said that energy and mass are
really interchangeable so he he took all
of this stuff that we counted on for all
these centuries neons and took them away
from us the only thing he really left
was with as a constant was the speed of
light and then comes along quantum
mechanics and quantum mechanics says hey
that's no limitation there there dozens
and dozens of things that travel faster
than speed of light and now we're sort
of left with nothing and john bell comes
in in 1964 with what's known now as the
bill theorem which states Eze that there
is no locality of causes that there
isn't a cause and effect the stimulus
response that we all learned in school
that everything is connected to
everything else that you and I are
connected right now you and I have been
intimate with each other already because
you've breathed out part of your body
and breathed in part of mine and we
don't notice it but we've been very very
intimate with each other already since
we've been in this room and John Bell
says that we are all connected together
then after that a guy who just passed
away a couple years ago David Bohm in my
opinion a hundred years from now people
are going to look back and they're going
to say the most famous person
world-changing person in the entire 20th
century
was a scientist by the name of David
Bohm David Bohm was an American he was a
graduate student of Einsteins at
Princeton he was nine Stein's favorite
student of all and got somehow messed up
in the McCarthy hearings in the 50s and
said I will not live in a country that
acts like this moved to London became a
physics professor at the University of
London and he went further than built he
what David Bohm said is that everything
not only is connected but everything is
the same thing and that has some
far-reaching aspects it means that you
and I and the market are the same thing
that the market is not one of these big
economic fundamental mechanical or
technical kind of operations the market
is really a composite of all these
millions of human traders like you and I
who are making these crazy chaotic
decisions in our life now let's talk
about chaos for example for for a moment
because chaos is going to affect your
life much much more in the next 20 years
than either relativity or atomic fission
or any of these other scientific
advances if you knew everything there
was to know about chaos and if your job
was to throw as many people off base as
you possibly could by naming it
something it isn't you would call it
what chaos we have it we have a talent
for missed naming things you and I think
we're right now that we're talking with
our conscious mind or we're
communicating with our conscious mind
right the left hemisphere up here but
that's the only part of your brain that
never goes to sleep it's the only part
of your brain that is really unconscious
from time to time and yet we call it the
conscious mind if you really understood
what chaos is chaos is not randomness
chaos is a much higher form of order and
what I'd like to suggest that you you
remember from this presentation is that
the next time you hear the word chaos as
in the science of chaos chaos is a bad
name
the real in the real message or the real
meaning of this science is how you
handle new information so chaos is new
information and we call it chaos but
it's new information is a much more
descriptive term then we come to the
part of how do we handle
information because up here on the chart
what you see is new information every
time you look at a chart the first thing
you have to do or what the first thing
we normally do when new information
comes in we try to organize it we try to
put it into old categories so we say
well what is it like it reminds me of
this or is it like this what we're doing
is we're massaging this new pristine
information and putting it into old
category and we'll we'll squirrel it
around and bend it around and make it
plastic so it will fit in there I have
been my younger days I had an experience
a bad experience with a lady who
happened to have red hair and and I
judge from that experience that that any
any female with red hair is absolutely
no good so today when I see a redheaded
lady unless I catch myself I've already
made a judgement I don't even know who
she is I've never met her
but this is because I have I've massaged
this new information into this old
categories that stay away from redheaded
women now we all do this we all try to
organize any kind of incoming
information once we have anything
organized it doesn't matter whether it's
a note you're taking or the IRS or
whatever there is a strong tendency the
first priority of any organization is to
survive now we're in an election year
and not so much now as we get closer to
the election but last year there was a
lot of talk about doing away with the
IRS getting a flat tax a consumption tax
or whatever can you imagine what would
happen with the hundreds of thousands of
employees at the IRS the hundreds of
thousands of CPAs and tax lawyers if we
really try to do away with the IRS
they're going to try to keep that thing
going yet once a bureaucracy in
government is established it keeps going
in the market once the bracket goes it
tends to keep going once a trend goes it
tends to go further than you thought it
would remember back in the mid 80s when
some of these wild-eyed skeptics and
specters we're saying that gee you know
the dial is going to go up above 3000
it's going to go to 3,700 and everybody
was pooh-poohing that and what happens
it's almost twice that now and still on
its way up anything that is organized
tends to survive or that's its primary
function
we were having a discussion not long ago
about the economy of the world and we
were talking about what are the biggest
movers of money in the world and we came
up with four the four biggest money
movers in the world and nothing else in
the world can come close to any one of
these four and those four are war
medicine religion and insurance think
about that for a moment
war medicine insurance and religion and
they all have one thing in common and
that's death and and all of us want
don't want to look that in the eye we
want to survive there's there's an old
country song whose verse goes everybody
wants to go to heaven but nobody wants
to die which points out some of our
paradoxical kind of thinking but think
about it you have war to kill people and
break things right and if you if you get
don't kill somebody and you wound them
you put them together with medicine so
you can send them back and shoot them
again and those who get shot and killed
you've got insurance to send some money
home to sort of ease their pain a little
bit and then you have religion to take
care of the ones who were shot but all
four of these biggest money movers in
the world have to do with that and it
has to do with organization now let's
look at some of our personal
organizations here you are in a
profession of trading commodities your
job as a speculator is to take risk that
other people don't want to take and if
you do a good job they'll pay you
outlandish ly for taking those risk off
their back but what did you learn what
was the first thing you learned as a kid
not to take risk right
don't touch the hot stove don't go
across the street you learned before you
had any intelligence to make a decision
to be risk adverse let's say you're a
two-foot-high person here and you're
adventurous you're not there trying to
learn what the world is about you're
entering the terrible twos as they call
it and your mama says don't touch the
hot stove well you don't like that so
you bite her on the leg and then she
whips you a little bit and you get this
idea this organization comes in this new
information organizes itself then I'd be
a lot better off if I wouldn't bite her
on the leg and then you take this into
adulthood and when somebody says
something to you don't bite them on the
leg anymore well we do the same thing in
trading we don't trade the market we
trade our own personal belief system
any questions at that point one of the
things that that we talked about in in
chaos and one of the things that chaos
theory tells us there are three
principles in chaos theory that that are
important and you can see these
principles at work in the market every
day and on every one minute and five
minute chart first principle is that
everything in the universe everything
takes the path of least resistance now
you are here because whatever was going
on in your life this is the path of
least resistance you're sitting where
you're sitting right now because that
was a path of least resistance for you
at this moment what you will trade
tomorrow or Monday will be the path of
least resistance and the market will
take the path of least resistance that's
the first principle the second principle
is that this path of least resistance is
determined by the always underlying and
the usually unseen structure for example
let's say you have a river running down
down a hill that if the riverbed is
shallow and narrow
you're going to have Rapids if the
riverbed is deep and wide you're going
to have a comp on it's not a decision of
the river it's a decision that's met
that's dictated by the riverbed let's
take another example let's say that you
had to go to the bathroom right now well
the bathroom is straight over there but
you wouldn't go that way would you what
you would do is you'd get out of your
seat and you go down the aisle and you'd
go back through the door and then you
turn left and go down the hall three
doors and then you turn left and go
through that door why did you take all
that circuitous route when the bathrooms
over there because you have learned
you've learned long ago that you're
better off if you don't try to walk
through walls unless you're Superman but
when you were doing that behavior when
you were going to the bathroom you were
probably unaware that your behavior was
controlled by the architect who drew up
this building and by the building
contractor who put the doors in the hall
out there rather than straight to the
bathroom from your seat the same thing
happens when we're trading we're
affected by things were not even
conscious on the third so the first
principle is everything follows a path
the police resistant the second
principle is that it
math is determined by the always
underlying and the usually unseen
structure and the third principle is
that that unseen structure that unseen
underlying structure can be discovered
and it can be changed so the underlying
structure of our belief systems that we
trade can be discovered and it can be
changed just like the kid who doesn't
bite mothers anymore that structure can
be changed let's look for example at a
couple of things about the market and
the underlying structure what happens
and who moves the market the first thing
that moves the market is out there in
the whole complex of trader land there
are changes in attitude about the market
I think it's going up and I'm not sure
it's going up I think it's going down
and that kind of change for you and
remember that that for every every
change in the market that it always
happens where there is an equal
disagreement on value and agreement on
price and that first thing that happens
is somewhere out there in trader land a
group of people who may not be together
but scattered all over the world looks
at the market and looks at the chart and
says hey this is not quite working out
the way that we thought it was so that's
the first thing to change the second
thing that changed is that produces a
change in volume either people getting
into the market going long or shorter
people getting out of the market
reversing their position just getting
out of going flat or whatever and that
changes in the market a volume and a
possible change in the bias of the
momentum and the direction of the
momentum following that that produces a
change in the speed of the current
momentum and it may again change the
direction for example the last thing in
the market to change is price and a lot
of traders and a lot of analysts say
well changes in price make changes in
attitude from our standpoint price
doesn't do anything price is the effect
the last thing to change is price what
changes before price is momentum what
changes before momentum is volume and
what changes before volume is all of
these crazy decisions that we're making
out there in
on land then the next thing that changes
is the speed of the current momentum it
will either accelerate or decelerate
it's like a bowling ball
something heavy and you take that ball
and you roll it down the street and as
the ball is rolling down the street it
continues because it has momentum if if
it meets a hill up here it'll slow down
on that hill and finally it'll come back
and go the other way in market
terminology that's called a change in
trim but actually from a physics
standpoint when it starts to slow down
it's really accelerating in the opposite
direction is and the market will tell
you that so when we look at the charts
in a moment the three things we look at
the only three things we look at are the
price where the balance line is the
acceleration and the momentum and the we
trade the market on these five
dimensions the next thing that produces
is a change in the direction of the
momentum and the final thing that it
produces is a change in price and we
trade this on a five dimensional basis
and we're going to show you exactly some
of these dimensions we won't be able to
show you in this time span all five of
them but we'll show you some of them
before we do that I want to share with
you a couple of things that from people
who are trading this way we have now
trained almost six hundred people in our
private tutorial who are now
professional private and mostly at most
very most of them are successful
speculators these are two people who
came to our seminar about four years ago
Charles Parker and Steve winland in
Houston Texas and this is a note that we
got to problem Bill I wanted to thank
you for your guidance this weekend as it
was very rewarding and closed as an
article from futures magazine I'm sure
you've heard of that magazine this month
just to show you how a couple of your
students are doing this was in December
and the the headlines were the funds
remain in a slump and these two guys
went out and established an offshore
fund called Sam 1 investments and
future's magazine charts every month a
number and little over 200 funds and
this was number one this was in October
then and the following this was in
December I'm sorry the following October
of the next year
it's interesting that they're still
number one and number five two of the
top five we're trading exactly what
we're talking about and then 1994 notice
down here the top performers for 1994
from futures magazine and you could
believe anything you read in futures
magazine was was San Juan Investments
the thing that that takes chaos from
chaos to cosmos which is unorganized or
seemingly unorganized to organize is a
thing called fractals now fractals are
nothing new and don't be frightened by
the word when Columbus invaded America
the mathematicians back in those days
we're talking about fractals and in the
1400s in the fifteenth century they were
talking about these are the theoretical
mathematicians they were saying well a
dot has no dimensions they were talking
about dimensions and they said a line
has one dimension a plane has two
dimensions a solid has three dimensions
and then they ask themselves the
question suppose you had a very curvy
line and if you have a curvy line it's
still one dimension and you had this
line and it was so curvy that you had a
plane a rectangle here and this line
goes through here and it's extremely
curvy and it goes back and forth and
back and forth and back and forth and
then comes out the other side and it
shades one half of that plane what is
the dimension of that line well for 500
years they pondered that and then a very
brilliant scientist by the name of Benoa
Mandelbrot came up with the idea that
this is a fractional dimension if it
covers half of this plane its dimension
is 1.5 now what that's saying is that an
ear in a chart form an irregular
scattered pattern will have a higher
dimensionality than than one that's very
smooth a straight line through this
would have one dimension if it were a
plane it would have two Mandelbrot went
further and he analyzed the fractal
dimension of the Mississippi River and
here we go down the Mississippi River
and he found
the Mississippi River had a fractal
dimension of 1.26 100 which meant that
it was curvy enough or staticky enough
or our back and forth enough that it
covered 1/4 of that plane then the IBM
management and he's a professor emeritus
of advanced mathematics at Yale and also
still working for IBM in Yorktown
Heights New York they came to him and
said well you know it's nice that you're
analyzing this but it'd be more helpful
for us since we're supposedly a
for-profit corporation if you would
analyze something that we might make a
little money out of later and he took a
four prong approach he said ok we'll
look at math economics will look at
physiology which is medicine we'll look
at sociology and we'll look at
psychology and from that and by the way
directly because of that we have two
things we have heart artificial hearts
that work and we have the world wide web
the world wide web would not work
without chaos and I'll show you why in
just a moment but what Mandelbrot did is
he said ok we'll go and we'll study
economics and in Yorktown Heights the
largest database they had were corn and
cotton prices so he analyzed corn and
cotton prices and guess what he found
two three decimal places they had the
same fractal number exactly as a
Mississippi River and then they later
analyzed the Ohio River and then they
analyzed the Tennessee River because it
was dammed up and interfered with by man
and all of them had to three decimal
places the exact same fractal number the
day that I read that I did not sleep a
wink all night that night because it was
like the curtains were opening what it
said was the markets are a natural
function they're not a man-made function
they're natural function so if you
really want to see how the markets work
take a picture of water out here and
pour it on the ground and watch this
strange attractor gravity come in and
pull it around the rocks and around the
high places in the low places
so this was a Mississippi River and this
was the corn chart same exact thing if
that be true then then the science of
chaos offers us a great deal in
analyzing the markets and understanding
the markets and it may be
key to why technical analysis doesn't
work any better than it does it may be a
better map in which to analyze the
market and we think it is and we think
that we can very easily prove that so
let's talk about a fractal a fractal is
a change in behavior so when the market
goes up and then comes down that's a
fractal a trend change a fractal one
fractal that's very easy to locate is a
fractal of when you will get out of the
market and you will always get out of
the market at that exact point we're
losing one more dollar is more painful
than saying I shouldn't be in this trade
and when you get to that point you'll
get out and that's a fractal a fractal
was when you decided to come into this
room rather than go into one of the
rooms down the hall a fractal will be
when you decide whether you're going to
use this material in your own trading or
not when you sighed Monday or Tuesday to
buy a bond or sell a bond when you make
that decision to call the broker that's
a fractal how do we look at a fractal in
the market own page and your notes on
page 9 there are some key fractal
formations and a fractal when we were
first looking at this we call this a
five-fingered boogie and we called it
that for lack of imagination of anything
better to call it when I was in college
I worked most of my way through college
playing in a Dixieland band and we had a
number that featured the piano which was
called a five-fingered boogie so it's
like your five fingers the definition of
a fractal is that there must be an up
fractal there must be a bar that is
higher than the two preceding bars and
higher than the two following bars now
the two preceding bars and following
bars don't have to be like a 10 they
don't have to be this way they can be
anything they just can't be as high as
higher so here on this first
illustration we have a pristine fractal
on the second one notice that we have
two that are same height on the middle
finger that's okay that is still a
fractal up over here we have three it's
still a fractal up it's a fractal it's a
fractal down here we have the exact same
thing a fractal a fractal a fractal and
a fractal it takes only five a minimum
of five bars it can be more than five
bars
but you have to have one bar that's
higher or for sale one bar that's lower
and let's look at an example of this and
let's look at an example in a real chart
and by the way these are these are
actual trading examples these are not
hypothetical let's look at at trading
the Japanese yen on a daily basis
starting in January of night of last
year and this is trading on a daily
basis and trading one contract for every
signal and we'll follow this through
January February March and until April
the 19th which is where we got out of
this trade this is January and that's
job and notice that the first fractal up
is is demonstrated or is is noted by
this this carrot here and notice that it
has a high it has two previous lower
highs followed by two lower highs so our
stop our buy stop is one tick above that
fractal so we bought that fractal at one
and we're filled on it at 102 thirty-one
any questions about that we have the
five fingered boogie or the fractal and
the market goes beyond that it's a
breakout it's obviously a breakout trade
yes a question we the question was which
bar we bought it on we buy it on the
first the first price that exceeds the
top of that fractal we take one tick
above that and when it hits that we're
gone now since that since you're buying
a breakout you obviously have the
world's worst trade location don't you
you also have the maximum potential loss
so you need to be satisfied a little bit
now remember that we're looking at the
market from five different dimensions
for example give you an example let's
say that we have an aquarium here and we
haven't a fish in that aquarium and you
have a television camera here and you
have a television camera from over here
you're going to see two different fishes
aren't you and if we look at that if we
look at the chart just from the from the
price standpoint we're only going to
have one dimension of that one of the
characteristics of the market is simply
this
that most of the time about 70% of the
time the markets going to do nothing and
only about 15 to 30% of the time will
the market trend and and this trending
is where we make most of our money and
you've heard I'm sure from a lot of
traders they'll say well making money in
the market is easy the hard part's
keeping it and what they're saying is
that anybody can make money in that
trend but when the market is not going
any place that's when the floor broker
is now the locals on the floor will take
your money away from and what the
fractal guarantees is that you will not
be left out of any of these trends my
grandfather used to tell me that
even a blind chicken will find an ear of
corn every now and then and we call
these blind chicken traits I mean
there's there's absolutely nothing
skillful in making money and in a trend
like that you just got to be dumb enough
not to get out and and it's very easy
this is the easiest trade to me it's not
the most profitable because on the five
dimensions this is the fourth dimension
to get in so in this fractal and in this
illustration that we're using here we
would have been in before that fractal
but right now let's talk only about the
fractal so that was our first entry now
we had a fractal up here owned at 103 81
up at that and that was on January the
16th and then on January the 23rd we had
a fractal down form and notice that it
was never hit in January and then toward
the end of the month we had another
fractal so we ended up the month on a
daily basis and we had 20 bars we had
three fractals up and one fractal down
only one of them was hit so we're ending
up the month and the ending up the month
of January at the end of the month we
were long from January the 12th fill at
1:02 that was our fill 102 31 the yen
was at 109 101 90 at the end of the
month we're carrying into February a
41-point or a 513 dollar open equity
loss so we've traded the yen on one
contract basis for the entire month of
January
we're behind 513 dollars not too good
yeah then we go into February and
February we had another down fractal
we had an up fractal a down Frankel and
another up fractal so in February we had
four fractals two downs and two ups
neither one of the downs were hit and
this is on your on your notes on page 12
the center of the fractal by forms with
a high of 102 and then on February the
13th we were filled on the opening on
our fractal by from February the 8th and
then on February of the 16th we were
filled on our January 16th and February
30th fractal by and had slippage on both
parts because we had a we had a gap
opening we're only trading the chicago
markets we're not trading the overnight
markets so we had this gap up
we were filled on both of those fractals
so at the end of February where we were
standing is that the end closed out the
month at 104 57 we're along for
positions 102 31 104 11 104 11 that was
on the where we got filled on 2 with
slippage and 100 76 we also have a buy
stop order for another position at 104
91 and we're carrying into March an open
equity profit of 539 points or six
thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight
dollars much better than the end of
January $500 open equity loss now we
have a little better than a $6,700 open
equity profit and we are now in three
contracts four contracts I'm sorry then
we come into March and March was
extremely good to us we only had two
fractals in March now can anyone tell me
why this point right here is not a
fractal why is that not a fractal down
yes right
it needs a higher low here in front of
it only has one and remember it has to
have two on both sides so that is not a
fractal down the same thing is true with
that one that's not a fractal down and
this is not a fractal up here because it
doesn't have one so it takes a minimum
of five bars at the end of this month
though we had a buy order from March the
23rd was filled at what 1481 the market
closed out the month at 116 97 giving us
the following open equity profits on 5
long positions now you're in five
positions on a one contract basis we
trade a multiple contract basis but
we're looking at this only on a one
contract basis and at the end of the
month we had five thousand six hundred
and seventy-five points or a little
better than 70 thousand dollars and
that's for three months and that's
that's a little bit better than working
for a living then on April we came in
listen I used I I have not always been a
winning trader let me be real honest
with you and back in the and back in
about 80 and 82 I almost bit the dust
and I was literally having nightmares
and my nightmares where I was having to
go out and apply for a real job and that
is a nightmare at the end we actually
bailed out of this trade on April the
19th a day after this and we actually
had a little bit more profit than this
but we made this up on April the 18th
and we had six positions long and our
six positions had a total of nine
thousand points or a hundred and twenty
one thousand dollars that's three and a
half months there are traders who don't
make that much in a year and this is
obviously a good example I'm going to
show you some good examples I'm going to
show you some bad examples this works on
every commodity and it works on every
timeframe because we had a sale it was
it was a reversal yeah we don't one of
the things and by the way let me let me
dispose of another kind of thing that
you'll hear over and over again what
you'll hear over and over and over again
is that there is no Holy Grail and let
me stand here and testify to that there
absolutely is a Holy Grail and I can
give you that hope in five simple words
you remember these words and if you
abide by these words you will not be a
losing traitor those the Holy Grail is
simply to want what the market wants
it's as simple as that want what the
market wants all of all of your
disappointments and all of your
frustrations come from one place you you
predicted the market you had
expectations and it didn't fulfill your
expectations right you bought the bonds
you thought they were going up you
fantasize they were going up you bought
them you bought them from a guy who had
just a stronger fantasy they were going
down and they didn't go up and your
expectations weren't met and you say
goodness gracious you know the markets
really tough and nobody can win at this
game but what if you had no expectations
what if there were no expectations at
all now when when I was trading years
and years ago I used to keep still do
keep very very accurate financial
records I always have this is the only
thing I guess in my whole life I've done
consistently I still have three by five
cards real tattered cards when I was 11
years old and had a paper out and on a
good month my net worth would go up 25
cents and on a real spanking good month
like Christmas when they give the
paperboy gifts sometimes might well some
years my net worth would go up 75 cents
in one month so when I was trading I
decided that I would keep an account of
how well I was treating so I would take
all of the contracts I traded take my
profits and loss and divide the profit
or loss by the contracts and I would get
an average profit or loss per contract
so if this month I average $75 profit a
contract last month I average $50 a
contract I would say well I was trading
better this month in last month and then
I saw the the fallacy and actually the
stupidity of that and I decided that
since I this is my way of making a
living and has been for a long long time
that I should run this like a business I
should have a cash flow a profit and
loss and the whole nine yards accounting
wise and did and that wasn't what I was
wanting that wasn't what I was looking
for at all and today and for the last 10
or 12 years I have evaluated my trading
on two counts one being more important
than the other the lesser important but
by deLee important don't let me lead you
astray this is vitally important but but
it's not the most
important thing is how long does it take
me to dial the broker after I see an
indicator so when I see this fractal
going up if i dial if I'm speed-dialing
the broker as soon as it's formed I know
I'm trading well but if I'm saying yeah
but it might be an elliot way fourth
wave and you know 85% of all my whip
flashes happened in fourth wave and
think I'll let one more hour go by
before get in that's a kiss of death for
me my trading will not withstand that
but the real thing the the real thing
that I evaluate my trading on every
second that I'm in the market is this I
look at the chart I know my positions
and I ask my question I ask myself the
question do I give a hoot which way it
goes do I care which way the market goes
and if I can honestly sit there and say
I don't care which way the market goes I
know I'm trading well but if I'm sitting
there and I'm long the bonds I'm saying
: bonds get up you know then I then I
know I mean I'm in a lot of trouble
because I am no longer proactive in the
market I am reactive in the market so if
I walk back there and I slap you real
hard on the face I've got you because
you're going to react and you're going
to react automatically and most traders
react you know the it goes down one more
ticking I'm getting out of here you know
that it's it doesn't work it works for
us it's been at least seven years since
I have been aggravated at the market now
I haven't won constantly in seven years
don't get me wrong but it's been seven
years at least since I've been angry at
the market because I will not if I'm in
the market and I'm rooting for a trade I
know from past experience the best thing
for me to do is get out question okay
the question is a good question why do
you set up five not four or three
because five five dimensions of the
market are all we've been able to
distinguish between now price you have
what we try to do is trade the
mass-energy space and time
so we trade the space and the space are
the fractal trades these are the spatial
trades but we also trade the
acceleration we trade the momentum we
change trade the change in momentum and
and we trade what's known as the balance
line which are what the strange
attractors do
so these and what we're talking about
now is one of the dimensions which is
the fractal trait and if you if you'd
like more information on this just just
call our office and we will send you a
computer disk free and a one-hour
videotape free that goes into more
detail and explain you
I'm sorry ask that's that question again
please yeah yes yes it waters is like a
river yes yes okay the question is if
the Mississippi River and the markets in
general the fractal number is one point
two six which is a number which is a a
measure of irregularity and that's very
important let me make a side point here
for example nothing in the world seems
to work regular if you had very regular
brainwave patterns you would be in an
epileptic seizure you'd be going you'd
be having a conniption fit here if you
if your heart has a very very regular
heartbeat you're going to die of
congestive heart failure in the left
ventricle so your heart what does you
good when you're running or jogging for
example is not that you're building a
strong heart but it's rotor routing the
stuff in the left ventricle so the the
fractal number is a measure of
irregularity so we use that number but
we the number does not give us a buying
cell so what we're doing basically on
the fractal what the fractal is is when
it comes up here and changes direction
and then changes direction and goes
further than it did it's it's it needs
to do that that's one of the the
curvatures that make up the 1.26 one oh
and I think this will be a little bit
clearer in just a moment okay let's
let's go from here then and let's go to
spreads because this works in in options
it works in spreads it works in
commodities and it works very very well
in socks also on a spread for example
you don't have the open high low close
you don't have volume so when you're
spread you're talking about one not one
price minus the other price so all you
have is a line and all you have is two
signals and this is your fractal up
signal so if it goes beyond that fractal
there you would buy and this is your
down signal if you go lower than that
fractal you sell and and it's as simple
as that it cannot get any simpler than
that
and let me give you a couple of examples
and these are also in your notes and
this is page this is another page on
your notes but I'm not sure which page
this is the Swiss franc yen spread now
we regularly trade three spreads all the
time
we're in almost everyday Swiss franc
Demark Swiss franc in Indy Markin again
last year was an absolutely great year
for us in the Swiss franc and the d mark
and the end and and here you see ten
months of the Swiss franc in spread and
all of these numbers are numbers of of
contracts not numbers will contract
these are entries and this is again we
trade multiple contract but the example
I'm going to use is a single contract
basis all we're doing is doing what the
market tells us to do we're not
predicting we're not analyzing in the
normal sense of the being it's the
market is is to us and I think this is
the more I think about it's more I think
it's true trading is like a religion and
in a religion what you do is you make a
leap of faith you make an assumption
that whatever God says it's true right I
mean you don't say well god I that
doesn't make sense to me you know
because God says it that makes it true
well when the market says it that's true
and anytime you say well market that
doesn't make sense to me so somewhere
along the line you have to have enough
experience or good experience or enough
faith to have faith in the market the
market is not a gorilla it's not
Godzilla it's not a Tasmanian devil it's
none of those things the market is
nothing except the projection of your
mind in a real sense so once you get the
faith there then whatever the God says
is okay and you don't question it so
when the market says buy you buy when
the market says sell you sell so anytime
these happens we don't discuss it it's
there all we all we do we become an
obedient servant and when it says buy we
call a broker and we buy so during from
March the 1st of last year until January
the 1st which is 10 months these were
our actual trading in the Swiss franc in
and on the next page there is a
know those those each those are fractals
each one of those number good question
the question is what are the numbers the
numbers are the fractal so this was our
fourth entry that was our fifth entry
it's not the number of contracts we were
trading multiple contracts but but this
is and this is based on a one contract
basis and the reason is based on one
contract basis is because in looking at
a way of trading I want to eliminate
basically some of the asset allocation
we do ask that allocation but the only
way I think you can analyze an approach
to trading better by looking at it on
one contract basis and you can a lot of
contracts another question yes those are
both buy and sell signals and we own the
up ones you can see we're buying and the
reason that was such a good good move is
because we move from way down here to
way up there and the results of that
move are on the next two pages and I'll
just show you here the last page and
this is ten months on a one contract
basis now a the margin for a currency
spread normally is seventy five percent
of what one contract would be so if both
of them were two thousand dollars the
spread margin would be fifteen hundred
so you can do for basically you can do
four spreads for three open orders and
and we have other ways where we
implement this also but on the d mark in
in this same period had a very similar
chart but not quite as much but it made
over two hundred thousand dollars so if
you had last year and this is you know
this is what they normally call well the
initials are BS it does it doesn't do
any good to look at the past but these
are actual trading examples you could
have started both of these trades with a
very small account less than ten
thousand dollars which is totally
ridiculous I mean we're talking
hypothetical now but ten thousand
dollars would have handled the entire
year of trading both of those sprits
and the problem is you don't know when
these are going to happen so you have to
be in the market let me give you an
example we do private tutorials and a
couple of awhile back we had a young
lady from Little Rock Arkansas who came
and she yes yes yes yes and I don't know
if she knew Hillary or not but but
seriously it wasn't Hillary this this
girl became a general contractor and she
was a short girl four foot nothing kind
of thing and if you're if you're a
female who is short trying to do
building business general contractor in
the good ole boy network of Little Rock
Arkansas you the odds are against you I
mean the odds are very much against she
way she was a success she built ences
she built some commercial buildings she
even built a couple of strip shopping
centers she was a general contractor for
ten years very successful got bored with
it and said I want to do something more
exciting I want to trade commodities and
she started trading commodities her
husband said you made all that money you
can throw it away any way you want to
but you not getting any of the family
money to trade so she came to a tutorial
and on the last day of the tutorial she
said bill I have a problem and I said
what's that and she said well I don't
have much money in my account and if I
lose this money I got to go back to
building I don't want to do that and I
said well Janet how much money do you
have in your account and she said a
little over $4,600 so I said okay let me
tell you what your problem is going to
be because she's really a vivacious go
go get a girl and I said your problem is
going to be patience and you've got to
trade some cuz you can't lose this money
and you need a lot more money than that
to really have a good chance of being
successful but you've only got about
$4,600 and she says well I know you're
going to tell me to trade euro dollars
right and I said no not euro dollars
euro dollar spreads intra month spreads
in the euro dollars because they don't
move that much anyway and so when she
came to the to the tutorial this is
where the market was now down here at
the bottom and this is not in your notes
but maybe you can see this here but on
at the bottom we had every reason to
believe that it was a bot we have what
we call our five magic bullets and what
that means is that all five dimensions
had turned around and gone the other way
so we had our five magic bullets when
they turn around it will kill a trend
I've never seen it fail not even once
and we thought this was the bottom this
was in November
then we had to move up and we had what
looked like a three wave moved back down
when she came to the tutorial which was
the first weekend in December we thought
that the this was a September December
euro dollar spread of the next year this
was in the first weekend in December and
we said that looks like that the bottom
is in to us Jana and what we're going to
do is we're going to buy a euro dollar
spreads at minus 68 all we have we only
have to take three three takes risk $75
and by the way the the margin on a euro
dollar spread is only $250 so you can
you're not taking a big risk
and so we're immediate question was t
okay that's good let's trade some how
many can I trade and we thought about it
while we said well let's try three
because if we if we miss out you're
getting in at 68 your stop is at 71
you're risking $75 three contracts three
spreads that's that you're risking $225
plus three Commission's and and that
would be somewhere around three hundred
dollars and you got $4,600 in your
account that would bring it down but
will it's worth a chance we think so she
left she bought the three spreads at six
minus 68 and she left and she was
leaving as soon as she walked out the
door to our staff we're talking we said
well let me tell you what's going to
happen Jana is going to get on that
plane back to Little Rock and she's
going to realize that she's only
margining 750 dollars out of her account
that she's got enough money she could
margin 16 other spreads because I got
still four thousand dollars and that's
16 other spreads well she didn't go 16
spread but she did indeed think about
that on the way back and she increased
her spreads now we got this this fax
from her a month later than that and
hopefully you can read it says bill sold
all of my euro dollar spreads except
5:00 this morning at minus 27 that she
went in at minus 68 and minus 27 total
profit after commissions was sixteen
thousand two hundred and fifty dollars
and this is what she started with up
here she started she left the tutorial
with 46 hundred and twenty one dollars
and and took it up to twenty thousand
eight hundred and and that was on plain
old euro dollar spread
any questions on that okay yes question
she was at the tutorial the first
weekend in January and the the fax does
not have a date on it it was probably
about three months it may be somewhere
between three and four months because it
was it was about the end of March as I
remembered that we got that and and
since then she's being expressed very
very good she has not gone back into the
building business she didn't go out and
get a real job another question
okay the question is we said we do lose
some from time to time and and if I said
we didn't lose you should walk out right
now if anybody says they don't lose from
time to time you should walk out this
does lose and and I quite frankly I'm
not very interested in wins over losses
I'm interested in the bottom line about
nine or ten years ago I had a very good
winning percentage my winning percentage
was something around 68 69 % I was not
made with the same amount of equity I
was probably making less than 10% what I
am now with the same equity and I'm I
don't know what my winning percentage is
but I would guess and this is a guess
but I'm pretty sure it's less than 50% I
don't win 50% of the time but if you get
out of your losses quickly you're going
to your win-loss ratio is going to be
relatively small I know that in the
commodity traders consumers report one
one year one of the newsletter writers
in there about May of that year saw very
clearly that he was not going to be a
winner in anything so he decided very
consciously I'm going to go for wins
over losses so what he did for the rest
of the year as soon as he got a profit
he locked it in as soon as he had lost
he'd let that mother go and go and go
and hoping it would come back and be a
winner so at the end of the year see TCR
he won the best wind over loss ratio
he had 67% wins but it was a losing year
now guess what the advertisements were
the next year which were very truthful
ranked number one by CTC are in wins
over losses well now to a naive person
that that's where I want to go but I but
the bottom line is it's what's
significant what causes the losses are
simply that we're not perfect and
incoming new information the biggest key
that we can talk about is let this
incoming information organize itself and
react to the market some of you may
remember the black comedian Flip Wilson
who used to talk about the Church of
what's happening now well what we want
to do is trade the market of what's
happening now so we don't consider what
we're doing technical now our our
indicators are absolutely totally 100%
unambivalent I mean if we took the 500
people that gone through the tutorial
and showed them a chart they would pick
out the exact same indicators how you
use those indicators is something else
because you may trade a five-minute I
may trade a 30-minute or I may not trade
that or whatever so it's it's very
important I think the most important
thing we could say today is that the key
to trading is to give up it's not to
outsmart the market not outsmart other
traders but simply to give up what your
expectations are it's it's almost a Zen
Buddhist kind of thing it's not that
you're trying to control the market or
outsmart it or out-powered anything else
it's like the market is a dog and I want
I want to be the tail on the dog and I
would just want to follow the dog
everywhere it goes now my friend Tom
Demark says he wants to be the nose of
dog and those is what often times gets
in trouble and I'll rather be the tail
than the nose question no this this the
question is is this a mechanical or
black box trading system absolutely not
the indicators are automatic there's no
interpretation of the indicators there
is some interpretation of how how much
you want to go how much asset allocation
how many you want to go how many
contracts how much you want to look up
but the the indicators themselves are
absolutely unambivalent it is not
mechanical it for example one of the
things we know is that 85% of all of our
whiplashes
talking about losses 85% of all of our
whiplash has happened in wave 4 and we
know exactly when wave 4 is going to
happen when the momentum tops out at
wave 3 that first bar after that which
which predicts the market which predicts
the price change and the accelerate see
the the acceleration changes before the
price for momentum changes and the
momentum changes before the price
changes so if you got this market which
is a bowling ball going down the street
as soon as it starts slowing up we start
putting in orders to go with the other
way then when it turns around we jump on
the board so the way you do that is is a
personal thing that sort of fits with
your personality for example the the
most successful trader that has ever
come to
our tutorial has been trading for 14
years his last and we swapped pns
statements every month
his last losing trade sorry the last
losing month was February of 88 and that
was what eight eight almost eight and a
half years ago that was his last losing
month that month he lost four hundred
and five dollars since then he has not
had a losing month his worst month since
then now here's a guy who fourteen years
ago started out with twenty five
thousand dollars his worst month since
then was a net profit of seven hundred
and seventy five thousand dollars and
he's paid sixty thousand dollars at
month in commission and seventy seven
seventy five was his net and and he has
not added anything he started trading
the he started trading in 1982 the first
thing he did he came to the very first
workshop that I ever did and we became
friends and we visit every year and he's
and now this is a pinnacle this is not
average don't let me again lead you
astray this and he makes more money than
I do but if you if you call him up
Monday or if you go to his office Monday
he's probably got a telephone on each
year and the telephone down here and I
don't trade that way I like the trade
very peacefully I like the trade with
classical music I don't like telephones
ringing and I have a Doberman dog and a
Siamese cat in the trading room with me
and and I'm very it's very very calm
there and that's that's my style so how
you trade is not mechanical you trade
one of the things that we try to do in
our tutorial is find what time what time
you're most comfortable with where
you're injured a daily trade and what
kind of trading you are most comfortable
with because if you're uncomfortable
with your trading then it becomes a
fearful thing and if you're running a
fear program you're going to do exactly
the wrong thing you're going to be
consistent a fearful trader is the most
consistent trader in the whole world the
only problem is we buy the tops and sell
the bottoms consistently yes question
ah good question and that's on the
outline that's in it your question the
the stop is to fractals back in the
opposite direction so if we had let's
say that we had a a fractal up here and
a fractal up here in a frack up here all
of these are freckles then you would go
long at this point you would go long at
this point and when you belong there
your stop would be two fractals back in
the opposite direction and it's very
important that it be in the opposite
direction yeah other questions okay the
the five dimensions that we trade and
we're really only covering one here I
would like to see if I can get this to
working oh ha ha ha I believe we have it
yes ok this this is the this is the SP
daily through yesterday and what I would
like for you to to see in this is that
there there is a fractal right there
does everybody see that but that is not
a fractal down here I don't think that
bottom of that bar right there is 540
the bottom of that bar is 5 yes that is
no that is not a fractal we need one
more up so tomorrow on a daily basis now
this is a daily chart so tomorrow or
Monday we would have a bye at 694 25 the
high of that is 694 the question about
the the stop then the stop would this is
one fractal back this is the second
fractal back here if there is a
discrepancy if the second fractal back
is closer to your price than the first
fractal you would go it to the farthest
fractal so to answer your question
really technically and precisely your
stop is the farthest back of the last
two fractals usually it will be two
fractals back and and what your what
you're seeing here in the gray bars and
the black bars and the red bars are part
of our dimensions which we analyzed the
momentum that the market has and it's
very very simple it's in the book and
and everything we've talked about is in
the book these we call squats greens
fades and fakes this tells you exactly
what the markets the reaction of the
market to the volume the volume can
cause very different things and
announcements can cause very different
things we don't trade one of the things
that we quit doing about eight years ago
and on our trading immediately improved
we don't read any current news at all we
don't watch f'ing in in fact I'm sure
you know what CNBC fnn stands for don't
you can never be correct financial
neurotic network and remember those guys
don't get paid for telling the truth
they get paid for words they get paid by
the word same thing is true on your
computer so we don't watch fnn we don't
read The Wall Street Journal I haven't
read a current Wall Street Journal in
the past 9 or 10 years the most of the
ones I read I find on seats in an
airplane that are they old and I'll read
those I like reading it but I will not
read anything that has current
information and I don't subscribe to any
newsletters I look the only thing I look
at ever is a chart just like this what
this tells me is the fractal this line
here is a balanced line the balanced
line is simply a 13th bar smooth average
that's offset eight bars in the future
the balanced line is where the price
would be if there were no new incoming
information so here there was some new
incoming information that's putting the
price up this is the momentum chart the
momentum chart is a 5:34 oscillator and
all that is is a 34 bar moving average
that is subtracted from a 5 bar moving
average and this is what we count the
Elliot wave on and this thing is is as
close to infallible as any indicator
I've ever seen in the last 3 or 4 years
we've looked literally at our staff has
looked at literally tens of thousands of
charts we found two errors one was in a
10 minute sugar chart one was in a 15
minute cocoa chart both errors were less
than five one hundredths of a point in
the wrong direction the bottom chart
here this is the acceleration this is
like reading tomorrow's Wall Street
Journal on any trend move and I mean
that seriously any trend move can be
detected here
but on the accelerator before it's
detected on the momentum and will be
detected on the momentum before it's
reflected in the price chart so we call
this tomorrow's Wall Street Journal any
other questions yes yes the question is
does it work on equities we are in the
process of completing a book applying
this to equities right now and that
should be out very shortly but yes it
does work on equities as a matter of
fact it really on high cap equities on
high volume stock it really tends to
work more precisely than it does in
commodity and we do a lot of things in
equities with this material like covered
call writing and rolling over and a lot
of things like that other questions yes
okay the question is the momentum is a
534 MACD it really isn't
when Gerry Appel invented the MACD the
the default that was first programmed
into computers was an exponential moving
average the exponential moving average
does not work as well as a simple
average so this is really an oscillator
so it's it's it's a simple average a
5:34 oscillator the accelerator would
make it an MACD the bottom accelerator
is simply a 5 bar moving average of that
difference so if you combine the two it
would be an MACD but if you use an MACD
you need to go in and program it to be a
simple average rather than an
exponential average and that does make a
difference it makes a difference in your
profits but does that answer your
question now it's a 5 bar moving average
of the yes of the difference between the
5 and the 34 exactly so it is a 5 bar
well all we've done is we've if you put
this here on a line it would look
exactly like an MACD exactly so we've
we've taken the line of the MACD made it
into histogram because it's just easier
to see on the chart but this is all we
look at we we do not get out of the
market because of announcements we in
the last seven years we have had one
occasions where we had a
move against us that was two years ago
last October we were short all the
grains and they came out with a food
announcement or a crop report and when I
went against every other limit move in
the last seven years has been in our
favor
this will anticipate what the bonds and
stuff are going to do one more question
yes I can but I can't because we only
have two minutes left yes but but it
talks about it in the book if you'd like
that or if you call our office or do our
email or webpage we'd be happy to send
you a lot of material question yes yes
yes we do yes we do the fractal is one
dimension the we we have an initiation
fractal to breakout and responsive
fractal the balance line between the two
strange attractors are here the
Momentum's here and accelerators there
so that's our five dimensions yep one
more question then we need to the
question is could I tell you about the
tutorial basically very quickly is that
we we send out a home study package
which is a three-month package which has
a contains the book a 300 page manual a
Kaos workbook which tells you everything
to do every day for the 90 days 12
videotapes which tells you exactly what
charts to look at 8 audio tapes 3
computer did and then you come to a
tutorial we have a staff of six that
conducts the tutorial where we work with
you we ask you to come prepared to bring
your to trade your own account on a one
contract basis and then we support you
both before the tutorial and after the
tutorial once you join they come to the
tutorial you'll remember the family
again if you want more information about
that call us are there some at the back
of the room ok the time is just about up
let me summarize very quickly the most
important point I would like for you to
take away from here is the difference
between how you handle new information
for example and in psychology tells us
that anytime you're overwhelmed or bored
it's always because you're trying to fit
new information into old categories
that's what we've all been taught in
school at home every place else
using the science of chaos we are
allowed to let that new information
organize itself then we don't get in our
own way the other thing that I'd like to
leave you with is when you're trading
make sure that you trade in such a way
that you really don't care which way the
market goes if you do that you're going
to be a winning trader and one of the
top three to five percent of all the
traders in the world thank you very much
for being here I appreciate you
