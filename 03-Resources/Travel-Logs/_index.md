| [[Fool-Journey-Entry-8-Circle-Inanna\|Entry 8: Circle over Inanna]] | Bangkok | Temperance / Inanna | Content vs. contented |

**Through-line:** The progression from forged tools (Shenzhen, Entry 0) through the interactive Bangkok Round 2 (Entries 1-6) to embodied interface (Samui, Entry 7) to conscious presence (Circle, Entry 8).

**Interactive Component:** [[../Technical/Interface-Design/WitnessOS-Interface-Bangkok-Round-2\|WitnessOS Interface]] — React application where interface IS ritual.

## Key Themes Across All Journeys

- **WitnessOS** — The operating system that runs in-body
- **6→3 Coherence** — Choose coherence, then create
- **Jachin/Boaz** — Decision rails (non-negotiable / safety)
- **Sacral Authority** — Clean uh-huh / uh-uh
- **Endogenous Activation** — No borrowed lift
- **One Line + One Ask** — Compression as courtesy
- **13:31 → 44** — Birth code as journey signature
- **The Spiral** — Not circles but upward returns

## Cross-Journey Connections

**Mythic Journey (55 days)** is the **container** — the full arc from rupture (Tower) to completion (World).

**Fool's Journey (Entries 0-8)** is the **technology** — the operational system extracted from the experience.

Together they form:
- **Experience** (Mythic) → **System** (Fool's) → **Interface** (WitnessOS)
