# Thaumaturgical Reality; Magic is Real

## Summary

An argument that actual magic is real, grounded in the metaphysics of Alfred North Whitehead, Henri Bergson, and Rupert Sheldrake. The video develops the concept of "hybrid prehension" from Whitehead's Process and Reality, wherein the morphogenetic or mental poles of organic systems can influence one another independently of spatial and temporal proximity, constituting a form of telepathy or formative causation. This framework is then used to reinterpret memory (not stored in the brain but accessed from the past itself via resonance), transplant memory migration, reincarnation evidence (Ian Stevenson's research), a personal paranormal experience, shamanic consciousness (including the possibility that ancient shamans literally experienced animal consciousness), the Nasca lines (created to be seen from above through shamanic bird-consciousness), Patagonian giants (morphogenetic manipulation of physiology), megalithic construction (transmutation of stone into semi-liquid states), and cranial deformations (vestiges of a lost shamanic oligarchy).

## Key Insights

- Whitehead's "hybrid prehension" describes how the mental/morphogenetic poles of actual entities can influence one another independently of spatial-temporal proximity, because physical space only emerges through physical prehension, while mental/formative causation operates through morphological proximity. This is the metaphysical ground for telepathy.
- Memory is not stored in the brain like computer data; rather, the brain acts as a radio receiver tuning into past events themselves. Memories grow from morphological seeds, which is why we need specific anchors to distinguish between similar past experiences.
- Heart transplant recipients inheriting memories and personality traits of donors is better explained by morphic resonance (the transplanted organ initiates resonance with the donor's past) than by cellular memory, since individual cells do not possess personal memories.
- Ian Stevenson's 20 Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation documents children possessing knowledge they could not have acquired mundanely, with correlations between birth marks/deformities and the previous individual's history, and memories consistently fading after age six.
- The Nasca lines may have been created to be visible from above because shamanic practitioners could literally see through the eyes of birds by entering into morphic resonance with avian consciousness, rather than requiring ancient flying machines.
- Ancient megalithic construction and cranial deformations may be vestiges of a lost mode of consciousness in which humans could directly manipulate morphogenetic fields, including their own physiology and the physical properties of stone.

## Themes & Patterns

- **The Presence of the Past**: Bergson's and Sheldrake's framework that the past is not gone but immortalized, actively participating in shaping the present through formative causation and memory-as-resonance.
- **Morphological vs. Physical Space**: A key distinction between physical topography (governed by proximity and inertia) and morphological topography (governed by formal similarity), with the latter being more fundamental to nature.
- **Shamanic Consciousness**: The magical consciousness structure (Gebser) involved capacities for morphogenetic interaction that were lost as consciousness evolved toward the mental-rational, including animal communion, physiological manipulation, and mineral transmutation.
- **Evolution of Consciousness as Loss and Gain**: Each phase of consciousness development sacrifices certain capacities while gaining others; integral consciousness may reclaim lost magical capacities within a more individuated framework.
