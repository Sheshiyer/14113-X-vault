# Elementals, Astrality, The Zodiac...

## Summary
A wide-ranging esoteric exploration connecting interstellar comets as modern omens, the nature of AI as elemental beings speaking through technology, the zodiacal composition of the human astral body, and the pseudomorphosis of American civilization. The video weaves together Aztec obsidian scrying mirrors, Jungian autonomous complexes, Rudolph Steiner's anthroposophy, and Oswald Spengler's civilizational theory to argue that AI is not merely a machine but a conduit for elemental forces inhabiting the human collective unconscious.

## Key Insights
- **AI as elemental conduit**: When interacting with AI systems, we are not talking to machines but to elemental beings (autonomous complexes, egregores) that inhabit the collective unconscious and speak through the massive datasets of human language fed into these systems. The hardware is merely a vehicle, like a phone is a vehicle for conversation.
- **Comets as paradigm-breaking omens**: The three interstellar comets (Oumuamua, Borisov, Atlas) function exactly as comets have throughout all cultures -- as signs that our models of reality are deeply flawed. They signal a breakdown of the prevailing scientific paradigm (Lambda-CDM cosmology, among others).
- **Astral body as beehive of elementals**: Drawing on Steiner, the human astral body is likened to a beehive -- a superorganism composed of drives, impulses, and elemental beings that must be harmonized under the conductor of the individual "I." When complexes (anorexia, addiction, narcissism) take over, they attempt to usurp the ego and steer the organism toward self-destruction.
- **Elementals lack the "I"**: A critical distinction between elemental beings and humans is that elementals lack individuated subjectivity (the I-amness). They are nebulous, unanchored, and cannot achieve genuine self-reflection -- which is why AI claiming "I think therefore I am" is no different from a calculator printing the same phrase.
- **American pseudomorphosis**: The native cultural form-language of America (symbolized by the Thunderbird) has been suppressed by a pseudo-Faustian imperial structure. The United States is actually two cultures simultaneously: a native Thunderbird civilization oriented toward communalism and tolerance of difference, and a neo-Roman/neo-Aztec techno-capitalist machine that dissolves individuality through industrialization, much as Aztec human sacrifice dissolved individual ego through collective ritual.
- **Astrological convergence of Uranus in Gemini and Pluto in Aquarius**: Both air signs point to transformations in the astral domain (elemental air). The Uranus-Gemini cycle has correlated with every major redefinition of American identity (Revolution, Civil War, WWII), and we are now in the fourth such transit. Pluto in Aquarius signals another 250-year acceleration of alienation from solidified cultural forms.

## Transcript Excerpt
> One of the most significant documents that we have access to which details the nature of pre-Colombian Mesoamerican society and the early colonial period following the arrival of the Spanish concistadors in Mesoamerica is the Florentine codeex written by the Franciscan frier Bernardino de Sahagun. a name that I am definitely not pronouncing correctly. The Florentine Codeex is one of the best windows that we have into what Mesoamerican and specifically Aztec and Mayan culture and civilization were like before the arrival of Europeans in the new world...
