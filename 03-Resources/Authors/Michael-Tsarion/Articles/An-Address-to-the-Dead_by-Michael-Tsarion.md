The present sociopolitical chaos (2021) is merely the latest move in the great game played out by the Black Nobility who expertly employ the "Ordo ab Chao" (Order from Chaos) strategy to further their personal agendas dating back to an _old world order_ you're not supposed to know anything about.   

So let's get clear on a few things, and remain sane in the midst of growing worldwide insanity. Let's understand that the present day Architects of Control continue plying their vile imperialist trade from behind the visible governments and religions of the world.

Are you not sick of voting in despots out to lay waste to your mind, let alone your nation? Will you finally judge these Machiavellian conspirators by their _deeds_ rather than their rhetoric and sophistry? Will you ever sincerely research their origins and agenda, and respect those who do?

A Fabian "War of Attrition" has been operating for a long time now. It started rolling before the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were put before you to slobber over.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|In fact, the _con_ of the US Constitution simply guaranteed the rights of federal despots (such as James Madison, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton), who worked for the interests of the aristocracy of Britain and Europe. It guaranteed the _privileges_ granted to the people or, more correctly, to the indentured slaves who push the wheels of industry in the _corporation_ known as the "United States." It guaranteed that extortion and confiscation, on a monumental level, could proceed unhindered either by God or man.   <br><br>It guaranteed that the American masses (slaves of the "United States" Federal Corporation) would be extended "liberty" to do their corporate masters' bidding. It guaranteed they'd labor under a delusion, because as long as men _believe_ they are free, they don't have to _actually_ be free.  <br><br>The War of Attrition moves toward its completion, and there is no going back. Because of the unseen hand of conspiracy, which you believe does not exist, ignorance is wall to wall. Logic, Truth and Justice have been annihilated, and while you watch your job being downsized or outsourced, the sorcerers dance upon their desks and clink their glasses in triumph.|![Picture](https://www.michaeltsarion.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/7987448_1.jpg)<br><br>The US Constitution was created on September 17, 1787, and was ratified (behind closed doors) on June 21, 1788. This is an Atonist festival - the Summer Solstice when the sun reaches its highest point in the zodiac. The "People" are not the citizens of America. Furthermore, American citizens are certainly not sovereign or free. They are merely slaves programmed with an _illusion_ of freedom. They are victims of parchment idolatry.

||_The shelves of our public libraries hold thousands of books pertaining to some aspect of this vast subject…In running through those works some amazing nuggets of information come to light here and there, which fitted together gradually unfold the stunning history and the legal structure of a sovereign world state located in the financial district of the loosely knit aggregation of boroughs and cities popularly known as the city of London. The colossal political and financial organization centered in this area, known as “The City,” operates as a super-government of the world; and no incident occurs in any part of the world without its participation in some form_ - E. C. Knuth (_The Empire of “The City:” The Secret History of British Financial Powe_r, 1944)  <br>  <br>_The British monarchy, and the City_ _of London__'s leading Crown bankers, enthusiastically backed Hitler and the Nazis, bankrolled the Fuehrer’s election, and did everything possible to build the Nazi war machine, for_ Britain_'s planned geopolitical war between_ Germany _and_ Russia - Scott Thompson (_The Nazi Roots of the House of Windsor_)|

Lesson One: The fanatical chiefs of psychotic Jihadist sects are backed financially and politically by the Black Nobility served by so many politicians on the right and left of the spectrum.  

Dynasties such as the Rothschilds may appear Jewish on the surface, but are in fact Sabbateans and Frankists hiding behind the veil of religious Judaism. What is more, this same cult has seeded its members with the organizations ruling your world. Fifth-columnists exist within the Protestant Church and have been their since the beginning, from before the Pilgrim Fathers landed on the Mayflower. After all, where did the Puritans get their money to buy ships and settle in America? Be it the Jesuits on one side and Evangelists on the other, the same Masonic cult calls the shots.  
  
You dare not change your allegiances, because you are far too scared to rock the boat. Instead you cling like a limpet to your particular dogma, pitting yourself against you counterpart on the other side of the spectrum. You don't hear the laughter of your Masters amid the clamor of your own mental racket.  

To change means to lose the authority which instructs you in every way. It means losing Big Daddy, and having to take responsibility for your own life. Better to remain in "Slave-Think" and do as the Puppet-Masters say. Truth is the world's most destructive thing, and you want nothing to do with it.

As long as you have a few cushions in your cell, and some salt in your gruel, and as long as you are permitted an opinion or two within the political den created by your overlords, you are okay with a mediocre lifestyle and the regimented predictability of your conformist, artificial existence.   
  
You have convinced your screaming soul that it is safer and better to just conform and be a repressed, toxic, programmed orc, marching to the drumbeat of imperious marshals. As long as one slave can bellow "Allah!" louder than another screeching "Anti-Semite!" all is well and death can stalk the lands. So sleep well under the shadow of the great double-headed eagle that tears the world and your brothers and sisters to pieces.

They are not the pompous demagogues seen on TV or in the _New York Times_. They are goons who occupy lower tiers of the great power pyramid. They are drunk with desire for power and will do anything to rise in status. The elites know all about the avarice of their self-serving agents. They use that greed to great effect. The elders at the top of the power-pyramid blind the world with a certain kind of light. They are Luciferians, after all. They occupy the white squares of knowledge and keep you on the black squares of ignorance.   <br>  <br>That is how the great geopolitical game is played. They have a myriad ways of making sure you don't stray from the pen they've created for you and your erstwhile fellows,|

||_Paul O’Neill - who was a member of the National Security Council as well as being in charge of fiscal policy - made a shocking revelation to Ron Suskind that not only are public events scripted, but even cabinet (and other) meetings within the White House with the President are scripted, where everyone but Bush has speaking parts. Bush’s role is merely to nod or listen expressionlessly, aside from his occasional cryptic (or cynical comments)_ - John Dean (_Worse Than Watergate_)|

But they don't have to work too hard, because your own anxiety makes sure you stay right where you are. It's this inner trepidation that has opened the lidless, bloodshot eye that watches the world from on high. The surveillance cameras are your friend. They give you the security you lack within. You love it when a new enemy arises. That gets you well off the hook. Now you've someone to blame. It's a very old story. You are not interested in finding out that these "enemies" are _created,_ just as so-called "allies" are. You don't want to face the fact that you and your children are victims in a global snuff drama, or that what you witness every evening is a well funded ritual - an _act of sorcery._

Two rabid pit bulls tear each other to pieces in a pen. Two rabid countries, factions, sects or cliques do the same thing on the world's stage. Do you think there is a difference? There's none that I can think of. Who built the pen? Who trained the cocks and pit bulls? Who's taking the bets? That's your homework folks. You'd better get your heads down and find out just what the king's horses and the king's men have been up to while you slept. And while you're at it, you might inquire why most people around you could not care less about the state of decay. Are such people in a _worse_ state of decay internally? Are they mind-controlled? Have they been inebriated or anesthetized into stupefied apathy? Do they cry and vote only to be comfortably as opposed to uncomfortably numb?

In any case don't worry. The problems are not difficult to understand or solve. It's not rocket science. It's merely a question of treachery, hypocrisy, duplicity and outright megalomania. It's simply a matter of wolves in sheep's clothing and, oh yes, _Ordo ab Chao_.

It was his Islamic enemies in Saudi Arabia and Iran that directed the Bushes and the Carlyle Group to take him down. And take him down they did. Obedience brings in the bacon.

Uncle Sam's fate depends on the whim of the Machiavellian princes of evil in Saudi Arabia, London, Rome and New York. They give orders to their Fabian cronies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Royal Institute of International Affairs, and Georgetown University.

But what of the Magicians? What about your _true_ teachers? Unfortunately, they are always disagreeable threats. They try to awaken you from your tranquilized delirium, but their counsel can't get through because you have lost the ability to listen. You're receptivity is blocked by a myriad imbecilic ideas and false allegiances.|

You have identified with the objects of your hate, as you have been taught, and have received a rickety form of psychological security as a result. The true teachers speak of the beauty of change, spontaneity, mutability, curiosity, free thought, and new perspectives. They tell ya to get up on top of your desks and look at your world with new eyes. ("O Captain, My Captain!").  

But that kind of advice threatens your paper-thin sense of security. So when the teacher speaks, your brain goes on the blink. You prefer the smell of vomit. You adore the drivel of predigested cliches, platitudes and half-baked rebuttal. You crave the parroted sound bites from the smart-ass, double-speaking, wiseacre, shock jocks and talking heads on TV. An attack on your silent and unseen contract with the sorcerers strikes at the root of the self-induced hallucination that has you believing all adversaries and pathogens are _external_ in origin, and that the problems that befall are political rather than p_sychological_ in origin. But that is okay. You can live out this lie all the days of your lives if you so desire. And you will do so, because it gets you off the hook.

Well, don't despair 'cause their syringes and happy pills will make you feel so much better. You won't have to inquire why you're in pain, or discover that the only love you have is for power? You'll never find out that your stress is caused by frustrated hunger for power. That kind of truth is buried beneath the lies you tell yourself, that make you believe you desire love and peace; lies that are the foundation of your ego and your world.|

You gave up wanting love a long time ago. Power-lust has taken its place. But you have never noticed this about yourself, and neither have the leaders you place in power. You and they are self-blinded and self-murdered. Blame, denial, denial of denial, justification and control is what you're about. You stab at yourselves in the darkness of your ignorance, but soon, as ol' Dorian Gray discovered to his horror, the blade might pierce your heart. Then what? Then it all ends - the lies, fakery, self-delusion and boldfaced debauchery.  
  
In the great social metascript, played out again and again, some looming bogeyman is dangled before you, and it's _Lights, Camera, Action!_ Year after year, decade after decade, century after century, the status quo remains the same. The proof of the inside job is before the world and in plain view. The facts are there, and nothing is concealed. What does the graffiti say? Simply this - _what your government does abroad today, it does at home tomorrow_.  
  
It's not a "Jewish" conspiracy, but a Judite conspiracy. But who are the Judites? Isn't it time you found out, rather than keep trusting headlines and the grossly misinformed. Did you know the Pope in Rome, and his cardinals, bishops and priests are Judites? Did you know that the Queen of England and her dynasty are also Judites? And these groups are made up of European gentiles.  
  
Families of this devilish sort have a long history. They are not secondary architects of control, they are the prime-movers who know how to divert attention where they want it to focus. Her servants are everywhere. The Bushes and Schwartzkopfs, the Colin Powells and Rupert Murdochs, the Thatchers, Geldofs, Greenspans, Kennedys, Clintons, Obamas, Bidens, etc, squat down on their worthless knees before her silver sword to accept her knighthoods for services rendered and for covering up her family's dirty linen. What a travesty.

Yep, it's time to look up the meanings of "[agent provocateur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur)" and "[fifth columnist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column)." It's time to root out the smirking Judases sitting at your table America!

||_In the years 1919 and 1920, two events of critical strategic importance for Britain's opium war against the United States occurred. First the Royal Institute for Foreign Affairs was founded. The purpose of this institution had been set forth over forty years before in the last will and testament of empire-builder Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes had called for the formation of a "secret society" that would oversee the reestablishment of a British empire that would incorporate most of the developing world and recapture the United States -_ Dope Inc  <br>  <br>_...the Anglophile portion of America's upper crust joined the fun. The case of Joseph Kennedy, who owed his British contracts for liquor wholesaling to the Duke of Devonshire, and later married his daughter into the family, is notorious. In some respects, more revealing is the strange case of Robert Maynard Hutchins, the president of the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1950. Hutchins had American citizenship, but was so close to the British aristocracy that he became a Knight Commander of Her Majesty's Venerable Order of St. John of Jerusalem, swearing an oath of chivalric fealty to the head of the order, the British monarch -_ ibid  <br>  <br>_Kennedy's unswerving loyalty to the British monarchy was rewarded; his daughter, Kathleen Kennedy...married William Cavendish, the Marquis of Hartington. Hartington was the son and heir to the tenth Duke of Devonshire...who have run British politics since the days of Elizabeth I...While serving as ambassador in Britain, Joseph Kennedy was made an initiate of His Majesty's Most Venerable Order of St. John of Jerusalem...Joseph Kennedy Jr. and John F. Kennedy were trained at the London School of Economics, an institution founded by the Fabian Society dedicated to training and recruiting foreign cadre as future British agents within government, business, media, and educational posts in their own countries. The Kennedy brothers were trained by Fabian Society Executive member Harold Laski_ - ibid|

These royals and their obedient agents transcend street-level political parties and ideologies. However, they are quite capable of using political demagogues to get their way, should that be necessary. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-4.html) for more...)|

Knowing this, why isn't action taken? Why are the guilty ones allowed to continue wreaking havoc on the political stage, when hundreds of researchers have exposed their dirt, when dozens of books record their atrocious offenses against humanity?  
  
Well, the psychologists and sociologists of merit have been telling you for years. You are dissociated. You have infantile amnesia, and you inhabit an abstraction that is a pseudo-life. You are dead to the real and alive to the simulacra. You are outer-directed and always on the go, racing headlong toward your graves as if eager to get to them. You've replaced experience with reaction and intimacy with performance. Your thinking is autistic, narcissistic, and masochistic, and you're in denial of your denial. You use your pain to gain attention, and perform good deeds mistaking those silly acts for true virtue. Your ambition and preoccupation is an avoidance of inwardness. You compete to prove you're better and that you matter. You _adore_ the clutter, noise, over-stimulation and endless domestic minutiae, because it distracts you from attending to your Dharma. You crave relationships because you have none with yourselves. You want children because by your twenties you are sick of yourselves. You crave _more_ so you can feel rich. Deconstruction, divestiture and psychosomatic catharsis mean nothing to you. All that matters is acquisition, competition, attainment and reward. The Earth can suffer, but that is all right. As long as you _succeed_ and get hold of the power you secretly desire, nothing else matters.  
  
Are you still confused? Do ya want to know what these words mean? They mean you are unaware that you are unaware. They mean that you have given up the right rulership of yourself. They mean that you have become totally dependent upon priests, politicians, medics and corporations, telling you what to think, believe and do. Actually its not freedom that you want. Oh no, you're scared to death of that. What you really want is freedom _from_ freedom, and Big Brother is itching to let you have exactly what you secretly desire.  

|   |   |

||_Freedom is the last thing he wants. He functions...according to the principle of pleasure in non freedom. To be sentenced to life long freedom is a worse fate then life long slavery. To put it another way: a man is always searching for someone or something to enslave him, for only as a slave does he feel secure_ - Esther Vilar (_The Manipulated Man_)|

What does it all _mean_? It means that you desire anything and everything that fulfills your senses, while rejecting and avoiding that which would fulfill your soul, given that you have one. And most of all, it means that you know only your _idea of reality,_ not reality itself. You just don't notice this travesty because everyone around you is the same mess. You're guided by the _misguided_. Your ideas of reality conflict with their ideas and, therefore, no true intimacy or relationship is possible. You are not miles apart, you are _ideas_ apart. And so you have hatreds, enemies, problems, stress, suspicion and confusion. And you're aggressive because, like infants, you insist that reality take on the shape of _your_ preposterous ideas.  
  
It _won't_ take it on, so you get more hardened, frustrated and aggressive as time goes by. You're destructive toward others and primarily toward your own Self. You envy and despise those with better ideas, but make friends with anyone who corroborates and endorses your infantile and contradictory ideas - those colleagues, work mates, priests, pastors and gurus.  
  
﻿You don't realize how these maniacs have poisoned and infected you with their sick memes and ideas. Well guess what? Toxic people can't talk with angels. Toxic people can't download truth or know wisdom. Their perverted brains are capable only of receiving mental infections from higher up, spiritual pornography to darken the mind and sicken the heart. Your leaders, _the most toxic of the lot_, are the self-murdered. They are possessed by something dark and vile, and are eager to spread their disease. They won't stop until the entire world is sodden and infected. Is that what you want? Do you want to be infected in this way and be like them? You must do because there you go, once every four years, scrawling your mark on the box, voting the parasites into office over and over again. You always adore living conformists and dead rebels.﻿  

﻿It's just as well that the infection that rots the brains of millions was not to be found in Beethoven, Handel or Vivaldi. It sure was not part of Bach, Dali, Escher, Durer, Blake, Rilke, Breughel or Magritte? Not bloody likely!   
﻿  
They were the Shining Ones - the _Servants of Truth -_ and their kind has always been amongst you. They walk close to you. But you've not felt them as they walk where you walk, smile when you smile, and weep when you weep? You don't feel their immeasurable love for you, that can never be expressed in words. They know all about you. How come you know so little about them?

No, you don't know or care. You don't hear the voice of sanity above the cacophony of the world. Your chums on Capitol Hill and in _Hollyweird_ have made you immune to truth. And you will give up your very lives in _their_ wars in order to preserve and justify the anti-life they have brewed for you in their reeking cauldrons. You lie to yourself when you say that your ideas are true. Are they true? You were breast fed those ideas by your parents and school teachers, and by priests and politicians. Now you water them with your own juices. You don't want to be free from these transmitted ideas that stand between you are the Real.              
  
The megadeath, genocide and blind fanaticism is _normal_ phenomena in a sick world of _abnormal_ people committing the worst crimes toward their very own selves as well as to others. Are you still looking for weapons of mass destruction? I can tell you exactly where they are.

No, the Servants of Truth can come and go. Their counsel doesn't matter. They are irritating and seem so dark and negative. You want to live in a one-season world, and will do so. The Global Village is being built as you read. And you'll be delighted to hear that the ride to it will be full of entertaining distractions. However, just remember that the train might not stop where you think it should. The train might chug right passed that utopian mirage. You might have to disembark somewhere much less appealing. But what of that? You're not interested in studying the map. The tickets were going cheap and you've reserved first class seats. You don't want the fun spoiled by doom and gloom merchants, right?  
  
Your own parents may have neglected your need for tenderness and care during your vulnerable years. So you became a disciple of power and death? You weren't told that there is a heavy price for living inauthentically. You were never warned about the consequences of living unconsciously. You don't know that civilizations have come and gone, and that the present civilization is ready for meltdown. You are not prepared to deal with real tragedy, and can't see beauty in endings. That is for people who know _how_ to think, not merely _what_ to think. It's for the Servants of Truth who _have_ learned life's profound lessons.

The emotionally mutilated taught you to despise your need for the care they were incapable of imparting. You grew to hate your desires and needs. You displaced your antipathy for these deceivers to wallow in self hate. Then, this hatred transformed into _identification_. You worship fools and liars but despise _yourself._ Inwardly you writhe in guilt and shame because you have negated your own precious Selfhood. After a lifetime of beating yourself over the head, you find that you have no love to give. You were not able to lose your own identity in mom and dad, so now you get a chance to do so with Big Daddy.  
  
But he won't give you love either, because he too is an apostle of death. He too has murdered himself and put power in the place of love. He's pumped-up with each person or country he crushes and humiliates.

What is worse, you leave your spiritually impoverished children little recourse but to repeat your mistakes. Your institutions knock the _Spirit of Rebellion_ out of them, and replace it with hypocrisy and conformity. You hack through their organic learning processes and force them into schools to be "educated." What a tragedy! They're goners from that point on. They're welcomed to the machine, but utterly lost to themselves.  
  
Their innocence and freedom of thought, their doubt and vibrant, inherent, _unique_ intelligence - lethal to your fraudulence - are eviscerated with surgical skill. They soon learn how to perform for rewards, and to jump through hoops as you do. They too have become experts in self-deception. They too have learned how to be psychic cripples and mutilate the self-esteem of the dependents they gain power over. They also learn to think necrotically and behave passive-aggressively. You've taught them that love is nothing and _possession_ everything. So memorize this fact and make it gospel - _never_ in your life, in no place and at no time, have you ever seen a child. What you see are slaves to tyranny, crawling on their knees behind a devious smile and rotten carrot.  

Once upon a time, at home or in school, you realized that a difficult choice was before you. You discovered to your soul's horror that you were being asked to conform to narrow, insane, artificial moulds, and to relinquish Self-Will.   
  
At that time you made the choices that have shaped your future and destiny. Quietly, you chose the way of servility. You chose to conform in order to get along and receive society's rewards. It was a simple "yes" or "no" choice. If you chose the latter then you are a child of the true Holy Spirit. If you chose the former you have nothing to do with that Spirit.  
  
Do you really believe that your sick priests and pastors serve Jesus and the Holy Spirit? Well they don't! They themselves conform and demand that you do the same.   
  
What they want and what they teach is the pure antithesis of the message of the _true_ Holy Spirit. They invent the very hells they fear. They _are_ the very hell they fear. But you pay their way because, after all, they expertly endorse and reinforce your own abhorrent ideas about life. Lucifer's business is booming. The creatures of death and decay are presiding because your world is dying and turning rotten. These misleaders are merely the maggots and parasites one would expect to find thriving on necrotic tissue. They are merely symptoms, _not_ causes.

As babies you did not like being separated from mother. No, that was most traumatic. You did not like having to be independent that day, and so independence has always been suspected and cursed. To this day you associate independence of thought and action with pain, anxiety and trauma. Like toddlers of two or three years old you are afraid of your own fragility. You over-estimate the power and _strength_ of the father figure. You falsely believe he possesses the strength that you, in your infantilism and impotency, have given up. Moreover, it is this fragility and lack of inner strength that prevents you from seeing the _other_ sanely and aright. The other is an enemy, not a friend. You can't shake hands because your fist is clenched.  
  
The other is not a human to be respected or regarded as an independent being with just as many rights as you. No, to you he is a threat, and your heroism depends upon his annihilation. Kill and destroy his life. That shows Daddy how obedient and good you are.

Yes, the psychologists have already told you what's up. As they say, a child is born a blank slate, innocent and pure, simple and direct, looking for wholeness and meaning. But instead he gets blasted with a chaotic welter of things to identify with and absorb. From the instant he is born in the pathogenic world he is over-exposed to the perverse and sick phenomena of societies in which nothing is virtuous or sacred. He meets no wise grandparents or guides, and his tranquilized over-worked parents are rarely seen. He becomes as lost and vacuous as the sick narcissistic world into which he has been born. He is overwhelmed with all the "diversity," and his ego has little chance of correctly integrating.

He is fractured, just as his society is fractured. Having nothing upstairs he operates on and from the lowest narcissistic level, and will literally murder in order to maintain his empty mediocre lifestyle. By design, there is constant invasion of _foreign_ elements. This is due to the connivance of your government and media that has steadily peddled the false merits of multiculturalism, diversification and globalization for decades. In the end there are so many subcultures, cliques and groovy splinter sects, that one has a devil of a time developing a true and integrated character. Identification with sane things can not occur. Therefore the personality of the child is weak, shallow and unsane.

Is this not exactly the kind of meekness that the sorcerers so ardently desire? Try going into a confectionery shop to eat every kind of sweet there. You'll be sick as hell in minutes. But this is the way that you have force fed your ego from the beginning. You are mentally obese, but still you want _more_!  
  
Your puppet-masters at Buck Palace, Vatican, Tavistock Institute and Georgetown University don't want you going around free, integrated and sane. Then you are a danger to them. So they perpetually over-infuse alien cultures and mores into your overcrowded life-space and, as a result, all peoples and traditions are compromised. Mention race, tribe, ethnicity or national sovereignty, and you are looked upon as a dinosaur or anachronism to be incarcerated or liquidated.  
  
Your masters have been preparing their twenty first century "Bastille" to keep you and your children in order. The technomancers are slowly introducing their nightmarish Global Village in which you will live, not as free human beings, but as compliant numbered sheeple in "mind-forged manacles." Privacy and independence will be of the past. The sky will be whatever color your wardens say it is. They will assure you that things are safe and secure, and that all is well. And you will utterly believe their lies. It won't matter that the hands that soothe your anxious brow are those of mass murderers.  
  
But before we play the blame game, let's first realize that it's you who inwardly craves an externally imposed order. You bring tyranny into being, and just because you don't face that fact, does not make it any less true? The leviathan does not come after you. You swim into its jaws with your own effort. You have had to accept that the world is spherical, but you'd prefer it to be flat. You know that you are judged by your deeds, but continue judging politicians by their _words_. A bit of highfalutin rhetoric, a dollop of tasty sophistry, and off to town you run, to scratch an "X" in the box for one more grinning psychopath.

Like an acid, media viruses have corroded your consciousness and made you unsane. A pornographic media has fragmented your children psychically so they don't know if they are coming or going. They are emotionally mutilated shards. They try this and that, until jaded and sullied they finally discover that it's all a sick joke. They seek crude power and dominance and finally crave extinction from their profound inner angst and discomfiture. Their case is critical, but you cannot fix them. You too are broken and lost. Your salvation is in the hands of the pharmaceutical orgs. You swallow their poisons to become _uncomfortably_ numb. You ride the roller-coaster in your relationships, and use conflict to prick yourself awake.  
  
It's your soul that is sick. It is your Selfhood that is infirm. And that is the plan. You are a perfectly operating "Manchurian Candidate" without feeling or reason.

||_...people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands_ - Fred Gates (Rockefeller associate. Occasional Letter No.1 of the General Education Board)|

And may we ask, what is the behavior of the hypnotized person? Well, we can be sure that his sensitivity is drastically reduced and his thinking is done for him by someone else. If he is told he is Superman or Sir Lancelot he will believe it. He will lose his inhibitions and act out his repressed desires without stint. Logic and reason go out the window. Meaning has the same value as madness. Salt can taste like sugar. He will commit criminal acts that he would normally avoid when fully conscious. He will not feel guilty for destructive acts, and will walk off the edge of a cliff if told to do so. Truth could be hollered into his ears _ad infinitum,_ and yet he will remain vacant and indifferent. You'll be met with a placid grin and all-knowing expression. Nothing you do breaks the trance. Get the picture?

||_Humankind cannot bear very much reality -_ T. S. Eliot|

Nothing lasts forever, and this world of moral delinquents has little time. The Maya saw _four_ creations come and go, so there’s nothing new when it comes to cosmic dissolution.

||_There have been a thousand holocausts, which have occurred in a thousand ways and will recur, both by fire and by water and by many other means_ - (Priests of Egypt to Solon)  <br>  <br>_Goethe had a premonition of this decline of the West: even in October 1801 he remarked in conversation...that spiritual emptiness and lack of character were spreading...It may be that Goethe had even foreseen, in the distant future, the coming of an age in which writers would make great profits by the portrayal of sex and crime for the masses. As Goethe said to Eckermann, on 14th March 1830, “the representation of noble bearing and action is beginning to be regarded as boring, and efforts are being made to portray all kinds of infamies” Previously in a letter to Schiller of 9th August 1797, he had pointed out at least one of the causes of the decline: in the larger cities men lived in a constant frenzy of acquisition and consumption and had therefore become incapable of the very mood from which spiritual life arises_ - Hans F. K. Günther (on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 18th century thinker)|

Moreover, the death of the rotten and corrupt is certainly not to be lamented. On the contrary, it is a time of profound joy.  
  
Have you examined the state of your _inner_ republic? In that narrow, sterile, super-lit asylum, your dark guardians come and go, bringing reports that tell of terrible inner ruin and what must to be done to restore peace and sanity. But you call these agents by some dirty names. To you they are "Anger," "Fear," "Hate," "Violence," "Loneliness." You put up great barriers and blockades against them, and turn up the racket of the world to level ten.

|---|_If the development of civilization has such a far-reaching similarity to the development of the individual and if it employs the same methods, may we not be justified in reaching the diagnosis that, under the influence of the cultural urges, some civilizations, or some epochs of civilization - possibly the whole of mankind - have become “neurotic?”_ - Sigmund Freud (_Civilization and its Discontents,_ 1930)|

You are like squatters hiding in a nook beneath the staircase of a wondrous mansion that you have forgotten actually _belongs_ to you. You've been taught to fear that place. That is why you don't explore the mystery of yourself, and turn instead to the exploiting gurus and priests.  
  
But the time has come for you come out of hiding. The time has come to fling open the doors and step out onto the high balcony to hear the great bells of creation ringing.  
  
You can now learn, once and for all, that the real war is on consciousness. Other brawls are merely distractions, adroitly created to prevent you knowing this. What you get on your TV is a global snuff film courtesy of 'er majesty "Lizzy" in London, and his "holier than thou" horror in Roma.

That filth has been designed to drain every ounce of Self-Will and power from your mind and heart. It's to make sure you remain hiding under the staircase, shivering with fear.  
  
You and your country can choose the way of love or the way of power. You can occupy the white squares of knowledge or the black squares of ignorance. Choice is given a man to show who and what he is. If you choose the wrong road there is always time to change direction. But if you have chosen wrongly, then you will surely be held accountable by the higher self (the Holy Spirit) that suffers from your neglect.

||_Thou shalt know; self-chosen are the woes that fall on men - how wretched, for they see not good so near, nor hearken to its voice - few only know the pathway of deliverance from ill_ - Pythagoras|

The Holy Spirit approaches, and many are worried. They know the end is approaching, and that the "Apocalypse" (or cleansing) is at hand. Therefore it's "party to the end" and "let's get smashed!" Satiating the senses is the only high left. We wonder, can you find the still-point in the midst of the insanity? Or will you tranquilize yourself all the more? Will you edit or observe? Will you learn, grow and take back your power?

Is it not time to cease "Wormtonguing" yourself? Are you not tired of lying to yourself and accepting the lies of arch-deceivers who imply that love is found where _truth is not?_ Well, dear friends, to find love there must _first_ be truth in your world and heart. And it must be unadulterated and strong. Only the uninfected, psychically-hygienic person can cure his fellows of their manifold psychic diseases. Only the knowledgeable person can raise the torch that extinguishes ignorance from the world.
