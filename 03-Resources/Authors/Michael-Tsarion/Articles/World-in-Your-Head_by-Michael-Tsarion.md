## The Historical Evolution of Thinking

Would it shock you to learn that thinking is a relatively recent historical phenomenon, and that not too long ago the human mind functioned differently than it does today? Six thousand years ago people didn't think, speak or act as we do. They did not care about individualism, independence or freedom. They did not read, write or record their experiences, and were not inclined to write down their ideas so others could benefit from them. No one cared about the difference between reality and fantasy. They did not worship as we do, and did not ponder who they were in any philosophical sense. The great existential gateway questions - *who am I, how did I get here, where am I going*, etc - came relatively late in history, although today millions of people still go through life without asking whether their lives have meaning.

## The Mystery of Brain Hemispheres

Apparently, the brain is the locus of our thought processes. However, people who have suffered major trauma to the left-hemisphere of their brains don't necessarily consider themselves unfortunate. On the contrary, many report living in an ecstatic state, with everything around them appearing strangely alive, vibrant and inexplicably numinous. How is this to be explained? Are they hallucinating? If so, where do their hallucinations come from, and why do we commonly deem hallucinations to be less valid and true than what we take for "normal" mental activity?

And why are these people's lives so drastically transformed and improved by left-brain dysfunction? Does it mean that the left-brain acts as an inhibitor of sorts, denying us ecstatic experiences that once-upon-a-time were quite natural?

Moreover, why is the left-brain divided from the right-brain, and what caused the split? Why are the two hemispheres *asymmetrical*. That's not what most plastic models of the brain show, and yet actual brain-scans certainly show how different the two sections are from one another.

## The Enigma of Sleep and Dreams

And then there's the puzzle of what happens at night when we fall into sleep. Why does brain activity not diminish as our bodies become tired and inactive? Where does our awareness go and what makes it return again? Where do dreams and nightmares come from? Do dreams have meaning, and are we right to suppose they do?

## Freud's Revolutionary Discovery

> *"Among Freud's most important discoveries is the realization that the underlying cause of psychological disturbance is our fear of self-knowledge"* - Carl Goldberg

In the final years of the 19th century, Viennese psychologist Sigmund Freud began asking deep and sincere questions about the mysteries of consciousness. Taking his cue from previous sages - such as Kant, Hegel, Schelling, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche - Freud, under the guise of psychology, introduced the disturbing idea that man is not in fact in complete control of his mind. This revelation shook the foundations of Rationalists who espoused the doctrine that soon *all* life's mysteries were going to be cast aside forever, courtesy of the intellect. Apparently, they forgot to include the mysteries of consciousness itself.

## The Unconscious Vision of Reality

Speaking about the uneasy interaction between conscious and unconscious hemispheres, Freud suspected that the content of the unconscious, although debarred by ego-structures, preserved a holistic and more real vision of reality. He wrote:

> *"The ego-feeling we are aware of now is thus only a shrunken vestige of a far more extensive feeling - a feeling which embraced the universe and expressed an inseparable connection of the ego with the external world"* - (Civilization and Its Discontents)
