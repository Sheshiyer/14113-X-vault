Why are nations, whose minds are cultivated and stored with knowledge, said to be "enlightened?"...simply because all knowledge was once supposed to be imparted by the God of the sun through its descending rays of light. Hence light and knowledge are now synonymous terms_     - Kersey Graves (_Bible of Bibles,_ 1863) |     |

**Light As Thought**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_What light is to the outer physical world, intellect is to the inner world of consciousness_ - Arthur Schopenhauer|

There are two kinds of thinking operating simultaneously - thinking with the brain and thinking with the mind. The mind and the brain are _not_ the same thing. The latter is basically an organic machine programmed by worldly experiences during our lifetime. The former is a phylogenetic inheritance or archive containing the enfolded experiences and understanding of all men and women who lived before our time. Their myriad experiences are recorded in the so-called "Akashic Record" or "Ancestral Mind," or in psychological parlance the "Collective Unconscious." Indeed, thinking _with_ the mind might turn out to be quite a delusion. It might turn out that we think _for_ the mind.  
  
Contrary to what we falsely believe, we do not come into this world as innocents with blank minds. Innocence, as William Blake knew, merely describes the temporary state of mind as it apprehends the world's phenomena for the first time. However, encountering a world and making sense of it requires neurological and bioenergetic processes which are both deep and infinitely complex. They are as yet far beyond scientific understanding. This is because their operations are subtle, fluid and interoceptive.  
  
According to hardline Materialists the human brain's neuronal sophistication is due entirely to the millennia-long process of evolution. If, however, the essence of all cognitive processes is _light,_ it becomes harder for us to imagine consciousness arising due to blind processes commonly conceived by Materialists. After all, _light doesn't evolve._  
  
Of course to a young brain, encountering a world of entities and objects for the first time, everything is new, fresh, exciting and incomprehensible. Originally we do not even try to overly reflect on what happens to us or on what we see and experience. We simply experience. We are less creatures of thought than we are of _desire._ As we age, however, we gain experience and relative innocence flees never to return. It vanishes when we begin contemplating our experiences, and when a mind begins to Self-reflexively contemplate _itself_, or what it imagines to be itself. And as some philosophers note, it appears that painful experiences often compel us to philosophically think about the _meaning_ of existence. As Schopenhauer quipped, "Without pain, life is meaningless."  
  
As we grow we certainly continue craving the freshness and spontaneity of early youth. However, we fail to realize that it is our own minds, our _consciousness_, that needs to be renewed each day, _not_ our various experiences. A mind narrow, superficial, narcissistic and toxic can hardly be expected to function in a healthy, spontaneous manner, or know anything as a certainty. An insensitive mind continues to have experiences and relationships, but few that are deep and meaningful. A docile dogma-ridden mind is content to take orders and be led, clustering with minds of its own passive hedonic kind, pathologically afraid of independence, silence and aloneness.  
  
Sadly, even relatively sharp open minds may not give the underlying paradoxes of existence and consciousness the thought they deserve. Aggressive minds are fast and acquisitive, but seek challenges of a more mundane, ultimately undemanding kind. These types prefer to adopt a detached scientific stance when encountering the mysteries of life, believing that the solutions to every major problem lie in the future. They believe we must continue to scientifically and dispassionately probe nature's secrets. In doing so, however, they continually find their absurd theories of a mindless, mechanical (deterministic) universe turning to dust.  
  
The scientist's intellectual struggle can be likened to a great quest. Grasping the final answer is a kind of victory over ignorance. For these types it is convenient to think of human consciousness as having _evolved_ from primitive levels to more advanced ones. Most men of science think of our physical and psychological maturation as a kind of ascent from darker, lower states. They are not inclined to think of it as Plato did, as a re-learning or remembering of lost knowledge buried in the deep recesses of the psyche.  
  
Nevertheless, despite the intractability of hardline Materialists, papers fly and castles burn. The foundations of their physicalist paradigms are not holding up under the welter of new discoveries about the brain and its complex functions:

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_It may be true that our conscious functions are related to centers and activities in the brain, but that does not prove causality_ – Gary Jacobs (_The Intelligence of the Cosmos_)  <br>  <br>_Perception, memory, thought, emotion, decision-making originate nowhere in the brain, nor are they stored there as so-called “engrams;” on the contrary, the brain reacts to thought, emotion, and decision-making (by mind) and operates the body accordingly_ – Cathi Carol (_Skeptical About Skeptics_)  <br>  <br>_The DNA-mRNA-tRNA-rRNA transcription and translation system, basic to living systems, is so complex and precise that it is astronomically improbable that living organisms could have evolved through a chance assembly of their genes_ – Erwin Laszlo (_The Intelligence of the Cosmos_)  <br>  <br>_There are more potential connecting pathways in the brain than there are particles in the universe_ - Iain McGilchrist|

Probably the greatest mystery about consciousness is the one addressed by German philosopher Immanuel Kant in the eighteenth century. In short, Kant drew attention to the mind's innate Self-reflexive objectifying ability. How are we able to stand back from ourselves and objectively view ourselves as we would another person or external object? How do we think about thinking and observe ourselves thinking? How are we _Self-aware?_ Sometimes it seems as if there are two minds at work. It's not as far-fetched as it sounds, given that we do indeed possess _two brains -_ a right and left hemisphere.  
  
That a _single_ mind possesses this extraordinary specular ability is crucial to Idealists. It led Kant to develop his philosophy of Transcendental Idealism. The capacity was for him the ground of philosophy. The innate transcendental categories of mind not only provide us with knowledge of reality, they also provide us with Self-knowledge. As Descartes emphasized, although thinking can doubt everything that exists, it cannot doubt _itself_, its own existence. Thus Descartes believed he had established the ground of metaphysics - the Self.  
  
My mind's extraordinary capacity for Self-objectification not only posits my raw material existence, it permits me to _know I exist_ and value my existence. Such Self-apprehension would be impossible, Kant thought, if man was nothing more than an evolved animal. The capacity exists because man is to act and think in ways that transcend his carnal nature. Man occupies not only the physiosphere and biosphere, but the _noosphere_ or realm of pure thought. He is not merely to survive as an anomalous super-efficient beast among beasts on an inclement earth, he is to awaken his spiritual identity and establish the perfect moral society.  
  
Taking his cues from Descartes and Kant, Schopenhauer believed that the ground or basis of philosophy was man's epistemological and ontological ability to know himself from the _inside._ Man's distinctive capacity for _introspection_ is unique and far beyond that of other species. Why is this the case? If we have evolved from an accidental mechanical process of evolution, logically we must be as other animals are, _not as we are._ Yet clearly we aren't the same as other animals that entirely lack transcendental capacities. How is this awesome difference explained? It isn't explained by Materialists who avoid the question and its ramifications for their absurd reductionist paradigm.  

![Picture](https://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/editor/schop.jpg?1538218890)

German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)

Despite his crucial insight, Schopenhauer missed a key point in his account of will and consciousness. Our capacity for inward knowing and all that attends this introspective capacity is more a case of _feeling_ than intellect. We don't _know_ ourselves as Selves, we _feel_ it. In fact, consciousness is more a matter of emotion than thought, the latter actually being a derivative mode of the former.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_The hieroglyph for “thought” is written with the ideogram for “heart,” which indicates that the heart-soul is a spiritual principle_ – Erich Neumann  <br>  <br>_The Stoic philosophy sees the heart as the seat of the human soul_ - Nigel Pennick|

The light of conscious thought is an emanation of the dark soil of emotion. Neurologically speaking, the left-brain's structures and systems arise from those of the right-brain which contains and preserves every emotion we've felt since our time in utero. What we call Self emanates from this psychic seedbed. If this process results in conscious awareness, as we know it does, it can't be reduced to a material process as commonly conceived by Physicalists. We may still understand the process as "natural," as long as we radically revise our concept of nature, along the lines taught by the great German Idealist Friedrich Schelling.  
  
But let us not conceive of emotion as static. The very word denotes movement and process. What we call feeling is a dynamic moment by moment evaluation and re-evaluation of Self and world. This is the background of mood or _stimmung_ that so fascinated German philosopher Martin Heidegger. It might be said that our infinitely complex emotional systems and subsystems give rise to the light of conscious awareness which flickers, dims and even snuffs out if emotional interoception is disturbed and discombobulated. The underlying nature of these emotional systems is beyond the comprehension of Materialists and reductionists, but not of Idealists or Mystics who have long explained it. They know that _emotional intelligence_ provides the interface between spiritual and material dimensions. They also know that no amount of intellectualizing will ever furnish us with proof of Spirit's existence. Hence the bankruptcy and failure of Materialistic science:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_…no behaviorist has observed anything that he can called consciousness, sensation, imagery, perception or will_ - J. B. Watson (Behaviorist)  <br>  <br>_I believe there is no point that can be discovered by the methods of science. I believe what we have found so far—an impersonal universe which is not particularly directed towards human beings....And that when we find the ultimate laws of nature they will have a chilling, cold, impersonal quality about them_ - Steven Weinberg (Atheist Cosmologist)|

We see from this that our consciousness is a matter of feeling which implies _sensitivity._ The Materialist's absurd philosophy is a direct result of his _lack_ of sensitivity, which is why we waste time intellectualizing with him over the nature of reality. We can't make another person feel deeply about themselves or the world of which they are a part. We haven't the right to intrude into their inner worlds. Until something drastic happens to awaken the all-important sensitivity - the Knowledge of the Heart - the Materialist remains impervious to the presence of the Great Ultimate.

|---|---|---|
|---|German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) whose radical ideas changed the face of metaphysics forever_._ Central to his philosophy of Transcendental Idealism was the elusive "noumenal" or "noumenon" - or so-called "thing in itself," which supposedly hides behind and causes the world of appearances. For centuries thinkers have pondered on this aspect of his teachings, wondering what the noumenon could be like. As far as Kant was concerned, it transcends thought and, as such, can never be apprehended by the senses or by reason. In my opinion, the noumenon or thing in itself is nothing more than _feeling._ It is the _deep_ rapturous feeling experienced during profound introspection. In this sense, the noumenon is the boundless Mystery, and one’s indescribable experience in its presence. This relationship is not, however, to be conflated with any supernatural entity, i.e., "God." The encounter is solely with Self and the Mystery of Self. This is Kant's noumenon, there can be no other. Displacing Mystery to the impersonal, immaterial and transcendent leads only to drastic errors, impasses, delusions and conflicts. This Mystery of Self is the central precept of _true_ Mysticism. No God need apply.  <br>  <br>_Thou canst not discover the bounds of the soul albeit thou walk its every road: so deep is its foundation_ - Heraclitus|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|The forgotten German Idealist Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854). Like Johann Fichte before him, he understood that a Self's innate capacity to posit itself as both subject _and_ object (the I and Not-I) is the foundation of philosophy.|---|

**Light, Sight, Sense**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_All men by nature desire to know_ – Aristotle (_Metaphysics_)|

Living in the world involves sensing the world. This sensing of an external world is achieved by way of the body and its senses; the most important and _sensitive_ sense being sight. Reality is primarily a _visual_ experience.  
  
Through sight we apparently receive the vast majority of our knowledge about the world and reality. Obviously, seeing occurs by way of the eyes. However, vision apparently depends upon the light that transmits or conducts a portion of the world's contents to the brain. Light is as they say _knowledge_. It is, as I said, also emotion. So is our conception of the world (our ideas of and feeling toward it) not a matter of light rather than objects? Logically we are in a relationship with the former not the latter. It is light which gives us both an apparently external world _and_ our inner ideas and feelings about it.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_...the Good is but a middle term between the intelligible and our intelligence, as though it was the intelligible light that allows us to grasp the ideas_ - Jean Grondin (_Introduction to Metaphysics_, on Plato)|

The very word _phenomena_ (meaning the stuff of the world) comes from the Greek word _phainomenon_ that derives from _phaos,_ meaning "light." The Greek word for nature was _phusis_, meaning "fire." It follows that our limited and imperfect understanding of the phenomena of light is detrimental to us. Isn't light as alive as we are?

![Picture](https://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/published/4392557.jpg?1578672278)

Our insensitivity in this regard leaves us open to subtle manipulation from those extremely well acquainted with the many intriguing properties of light; from those who think of themselves as _elites_ and _alumni_, as _illumined, illustrious_ and _elevated._ More on this as we go.  
  
Interestingly the entrance of ithyphallic beams of light into the vesica-shaped eye can be likened to the sexual act. The penetration of light is experienced as an erotic act by the brain which is after all a mass of super-sensitive nerves.  
  
This subtle optical experience may be compared to a miniature orgasm small enough to not be noticed consciously but strong enough to be stimulate and entrain.  
  
Because of the inherent eroticism of light we literally become _addicted_ to external light and its symbols. In one sense we are light-infatuated.  
  
However light is dualistic and polarized because, as an active beam, it has a source and a receptacle. Moreover, wherever we find light we also find shadow; something else that hasn't "evolved." Which one, we ask, gives birth to the other?  
  
But what happens if this is only a part of the story of light. As many philosophers stressed, external light is but the simulacrum of _internal_ psychic light. Is this true, and what if the light of mind originates somewhere other than the sun above our heads? What if we have been deluded by about the origin of light?  
  
What this means psychologically and neurobiologically has to do with the asymmetrical relationship between the hemispheres of the brain. The left-brain isn't focused on the light of the external world, as we believe, but on that which emanates from the mysterious reaches of the right-brain. This is the reason why light has always been mysterious to us. It is the _inner_ bioenergetic light that is the mystery, not the external kind. It is the light of our own being which fascinates and leads us to quest after the truth of ourselves.  
  
It is the right-brain's vision of reality that is computed by the left-brain and which, after radical editing and refraction by the latter, becomes our impoverished image of reality. The left-brain, as it were, digitizes the right-brain's holistic vision. It also concretizes it, giving us the false impression of a hard material world comprised of hard material objects and entities. Materialist outlooks and theories - of a Big Bang and a beginning of time, etc - make sense only within the limited contextual framework manufactured by the left-brain (or ego). Nevertheless, for all its industry the left-brain is handicapped. Its processed simulacrum of reality, although reduced and desacralized, is still composed of _light_ emanating from the dark mysterious reaches of the psyche. That light is and always will be numinous and true, even in the hands of the Demiurge.  
  
We now understand the magical nature of light. The world's light entering our eyes doesn't reveal the world after all. It's the psychic light emanating from our own right-hemisphere that does the trick. We only surmise that its origin is external sunlight. Maybe it is and maybe not. Maybe _externality,_ like matter, is simply a mental idea. In any case the mind's own light presents us with a processed digitized image of the apparently external world, reduced, refracted and desacralized by the editing process of the left-hemisphere.  
  
What a deathblow for Materialism if it turns out that psychic and physical light are of the _same_ substance. What comes of Cartesian theories of hard dualism? What comes of the subject versus object and mind versus matter divisions? What happens to the traditional scientific dogma of Darwinian evolution?

The two hemispheres of the human brain appear symmetrical,  
but are not. Why is this? Do we in fact possess _two_ brains?

**Fearful Symmetry**  
If God is light, does he have a dark side? Few can account for the strange ambivalence within the nature of God. We will, however, account for it once we realize the all-important connections between "God" and "Devil" - the right and left hemispheres of the brain.

||_Any development, at any stage, that strives toward patriarchal consciousness, toward the sun, looks on the moon spirit as the spirit of regression, as the terrible mother, as a witch -_ Erich Neumann (_The Origin and Evolution of Consciousness_)  <br>  <br>_…monotheism does not mirror human society. Humans are first and foremost social animals. A deity who was alone, not by choice but because there were no other companions for Him, was a concept without parallel in human society. The god of the Israelites did not have a wife, a son, a daughter, or a mother_ - Leonard Shlain (_The Alphabet Versus the Goddess_)|

So much for the picture of reality supplied by the left-hemisphere of our brains. It is neither holistic nor natural. On the contrary, it is the cause of the mental and emotional _desensitization_ leading to Materialist outlooks and arguments.  
  
Even more problematically, the left-brain's false image of reality includes our image and idea of Self. It too is highly condensed, disfigured and impoverished. In psychological parlance this false idea is known as the ego-ideal. It is in turn highly influenced by the superego, which might be described as the inner "Demiurge," the psychic representative of parents and society. As Jung and others stressed, man does not operate in the world as an authentic Self, but as a pseudo- or counterfeit-self. He wears the mask or persona and participates in the social masquerade. He lives as a prisoner of his own mind, getting more armored, insensitive, disenchanted, addicted and outer-directed by the hour.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|The left-brain or ego had a beginning. This event is projected outward by the left-brain, resulting in scientific hogwash about the universe itself having a beginning. Actually, cosmically, there is no such thing as a "beginning." In fact the word connotes a _process_, which is what a beginning is as soon as it begins. So while Materialists irrationally focus on the word "beginning," the Idealist prefers to focus on the word "process" and the sense it makes for all existence.

|---|The signature of the left-brain is the mathematical concept zero. Nature has no such principle, consciousness does. The zero for consciousness marks the advent of left-brain awareness and cognition, already out of sync with reality.

**Princes of Light**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_Twelve centuries of moral and political darkness...had nearly completed the  <br>destruction of human dignity, and everything valuable or ornamental in the  <br>character of man_. _During this long and doleful night of ignorance, slavery, and superstition, Christianity reigned triumphant_ - Elihu Palmer (_Principles of Nature_)|

What does all this have to do with Atonism, you ask. Well, it is vital for us to understand how important these metaphysical principles are to the elites within the secret societies, particularly to Setian-Atonists whose ideas about light are very eccentric. Foremost among these ideas and the secret of their power over humanity is the property of light which _conceals_ and _blinds._  
  
As I explain in Volume Two, to Atonists, Templars and Masons, light serves as a veil behind which another more exotic and strictly private form of worship proceeds_._ I refer to this phenomenon as _the dark side of the sun_. The Setian-Atonist manipulates the symbols of the sun and of light to bedazzle and solarize the minds of the masses. The outcome of this industry we know as _religion._  
  
Judeo-Christianity works and has lasted through the centuries because it is solar and _phallic_. In writings to his Masonic brethren, Albert Pike reveals the esoteric connections between light and phallicism:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_In the Book of Enoch, in speaking of the fallen angels it is said: "The name of the first is Yekun: he it as who seduced all the sons of the Holy Angel; and causing them to descend on earth, led astray the offspring of men...and the name, as Yekain, is fitly represented by a phallic column"_ - (_Book of the Words_)|

Yekun becomes Jakin_,_ one of the pillars at the gates of Solomon's (Aton's) Temple. We see these two stately pillars at the portals of Masonic lodges and important government buildings. These phallic altars to Set and Aton can be found in most civic centers in the world as the obelisk, tower or single erect stone monument. They stand in the center of prominent city squares and near many banks, churches and educational institutions. The very word _phallic_ comes from _phalos_ which meaning "white" or "bright." It is akin to _phaos_ that also means "light." 

       _By the very name, it (the phallus) was connected with the Sun -_ Albert Pike

So when we discuss the masculine tendency, acquisitive drives and animalistic brutality causing havoc in the world, let us understand that it is metaphysically rooted in a perverse ideology and iconography of light. Yes, tyranny and violence are shining hydras made from the great weapon in the hands of the "Lords of Light" who expertly bedazzle the world with their spectacular _industrial light and magic._

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_…there were no religious wars in the ancient world before monotheism_ - Leonard Shlain (_The Goddess Versus the Alphabet)_  <br>  <br>Nicholas Copernicus _displaced Mother Earth from the center of the universe and replaced her with Father Sun_ - ibid|

On the relationship between light and masculinity, Mary Esther Harding writes:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_The rise of masculine power and of patriarchal society probably started when man began to accumulate personal, as over against communal, property and found that his personal strength and prowess could increase his personal possessions. This change in secular power coincided with the rise of sun worship under a male priesthood...Sun worship was usually introduced and established by an edict of a military dictator, as happened in Babylon and Egypt, and probably other countries as well_ _-_ (_Woman's Mysteries_)|

Jungian psychoanalyst, Erich Neumann, writes about the connection between masculinity and phallicism:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_The correlation of consciousness with masculinity culminates in the development of science, as an attempt by the masculine spirit to emancipate itself from the power of the unconscious...We call this path "ascent" because we experience consciousness and the world of light as being "above" us and unconscious and darkness "below" still under the spell of the primitive symbolism which associates the upright posture of the human figure with the development of the head and the rest of the "higher" centers of consciousness_ - (_The Origin and Evolution of Consciousness_)|

Of course this begs the all-important question of what caused the rise of phallicism in the first place. The exaggeration of the principle in religion and culture must have a reason. Why was the feminine principle considered threatening? Should such a threat exist, is it responsible for the disastrous irrational skewing of masculinity and solar worship? Our view of history and consciousness inverts based on the answer to this all-important question.  
  
We find out just how important light in this hyper-phallic mode is to Masons from one of their most distinguished members, Albert Mackey, who wrote several books on the meaning of Masonry and its various rites and traditions. In _The Symbolism of Freemasonry_, he added a chapter on light and what it means to a Mason:

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_…here again we have in Masonry that old and often-repeated allusion to sun-worship, which has already been seen in the officers of a lodge, and in the point within a circle. And as the circumambulation is made around the lodge, just as the sun was supposed to move around the earth, we are brought back to the original symbolism with which we commenced—that the lodge is a symbol of the world._  <br>  <br>_This rite of intrusting is, of course, divided into several parts or periods; for the aporreta, or secret things of Masonry, are not to be given at once, but in gradual progression. It begins, however, with the communication of LIGHT, which, although but a preparation for the development of the mysteries which are to follow, must be considered as one of the most important symbols in the whole science of masonic symbolism._  <br>  <br>_Light was, in accordance with this old religious sentiment, the great object of attainment in all the ancient religious Mysteries. It was there, as it is now, in Masonry, made the symbol of truth and knowledge. This was always its ancient symbolism, and we must never lose sight of this emblematic meaning, when we are considering the nature and signification of masonic light. When the candidate makes a demand for light, it is not merely for that material light which is to remove a physical darkness; that is only the outward form, which conceals the inward symbolism. He craves an intellectual illumination which will dispel the darkness of mental and moral ignorance, and bring to his view, as an eye-witness, the sublime truths of religion, philosophy, and science, which it is the great design of Freemasonry to teach._|

We see from this that we are in fact dealing with _two_ modes of dualism. There is the polarization of light and its nemesis, and the polarity within light itself. In other words, that which seeks to overcome dualism is itself divided.  
  
Mackey then address the peculiar dualism of light. His words go to the heart of our inquiry:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_Light was venerated because it was an emanation from the sun, and, in the materialism of the ancient faith, light and darkness were both personified as positive existences, the one being the enemy of the other. Two principles were thus supposed to reign over the world, antagonistic to each other, and each alternately presiding over the destinies of mankind. The contests between the good and evil principle, symbolized by light and darkness, composed a very large part of the ancient mythology in all countries._|

Let's see what else we can learn from the occult symbolism employed by light-obsessed secret societies:

![Picture](https://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/editor/8304094.jpg?1533687350)

The obelisk directs our attention upward toward the sun. But why are we infatuated with light? Why is it mysterious to us at all, and who manipulates our fascination with light?  
  
As I show throughout my work, cities have been meticulously designed and laid out by Masons. Those who live within the perimeters of cities unconsciously partake in Masonic rituals. The word _city_ comes from the same root as _cteis_, meaning "vagina." Similarly, the term _hall_ comes from _phallus_, meaning "penis."  
  
In one context, for princes and disciples of light the phallus has apotropaic properties. In other words it wards off evil. Emphasizing the antipathy between light and darkness, and masculine and feminine polarities, William Sterling writes:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_The Vesica was also regarded as a baneful object under the name of the “Evil Eye,” and the charm most generally employed to avert the dread effects of its fascination was the Phallus_ – (_The Canon_, 1897)  <br>  <br>_Since it was supposed that the generation of the world was accomplished after the manner of men, we must conceive the Macrocosm or celestial Adam stretched within the sphere of the Zodiac, so that the center of his body (the phallus) coincides with the center of the universe occupied by the earth and the elements_ - ibid|

Regardless of which is older, solar or phallic worship, they were finally conflated  
by those who understood the power of light and libido or sexual energy. Jesus and  
the Buddha are frequently subtextually depicted as phallic deities, and ancient images of penises were stylized to look like rampant bulls, lions and other zoomorphs.

Here we see a Masonic tracing board with three columns or pillars - Doric, Corinthian and Ionic. (The Doric is the oldest form, symbolizing the male body and inseminating cause of all being, the phallic Jehovah. The Corinthian being tall and slim represents the young virgin or receptacle. The Ionic (from Yoni) represents the matriarchal principle, the genetrix or goddess. Asherah or Shekinah) The three columns or pillars represent the phallic worship which goes on behind closed doors. Each column's design represents a specific degree of initiation into the Mithraic or Solar Cult. Dionysian ritualistic motifs are commonly found in Masonry, Templarism and the three major world religions.  <br>  <br>In Egypt Osiris was symbolized by the so-called Djed or Tat column. His resurrection was commemorated by the ritual erection of a large pillar from the horizontal to the vertical position.

Three columns probably originate from the three pyramids on the Giza Plateau which in turn parallel the megalithic complex at County Meath, Ireland: of Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth. They also represent the paths known as the Ida, Pingala and Shusumna, as well as the three main Kabalistic pillars of the s0-called Tree of Life. Each column represents one of the three levels of an initiate's advancement and purification in the arcane mysteries. The ladder serves as a metaphor for the steps of the pyramid reaching up toward heaven (noosphere). Above we see the sun, a zodiac symbol and the crescent of Venus. The so-called Temple of Solomon, and its two famous pillars, are believed to have been constructed by architect Hiram Abiff. As I show in the [Appendix](https://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/druidic-symbolism-i.html) on Druidic symbolism, Abiff was either a Druid or Persian Magi.

Escher, Salvador Dali, Georges De Chirico, and other philosophically-minded artists obsessed with the physical and metaphysical properties of light, Magritte was referring to the remarkable ability of human beings to believe in _ideas of reality_ rather than in reality itself.|

He was speaking about the strange antipathy that apparently exists between idea and reality, appearance and fact, deception and truth, darkness and light.  
  
This antipathy was a mystery that also perplexed oriental mystics who rendered the problem in their Yin Yang symbol known as the "Eyes of the Dragon." This symbol expressed a similar concept as the two eyes of the Egyptian god Ra. The Masons also embodied the dichotomy in their checkerboard designs. For Masons the black squares represent human ignorance, while the white squares represent knowledge. Those who occupy the black squares of ignorance, so to speak, are not considered fully human or alive.

The arms point up and down to signify the dualism underlying creation and consciousness. The pose also represents growth and progress versus decay and regression. The female breasts and phallic caduceus indicate that Baphomet is an androgynous icon. The name _Baphomet_ may derive from the Arabic word _abufihamet_, meaning “father of wisdom.” It may also derive from _Ptah_ (father) and _Ma'at_ (mother), or alternatively from _Baphe_ (baptism) and _Metis_ (wisdom). The theme appears to be the harmonization of imbalanced opposites, which begs the question of why polarization and imbalance occurs in the first place.  <br>  <br>_Baptism was one of the observances in the worship of Adonis in Mesopotamia and Arabia.

**The Fall of Light**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_The whole earth has been made the wretched abode of ignorance and misery; and to priests and tyrants these dreadful effects are to be attributed_ - Elihu Palmer (_Principles of Nature_)|

Certain Gnostic groups associated light with Lucifer - the Fallen Angel. Kabalists maintained that Lucifer fell from heaven like a zigzagging lightening flash. Light, they believe, descended _downwards_ through ten major centers known as Sephiroth (or spheres). After its descent, the light, in a relatively diminished form, came to rest in the realm known as "Malkuth" - the physical plane or reality. The light which men normally perceive in the world, and that illumines thought inwardly, is of this diminished variety. Nevertheless, it has the ability to lead the initiated neophyte to higher grades and realities. Once the adept has reached the highest level, known as "Kether," he is considered enlightened and all knowing. By following the light he comes to face his own psychic darkness and dirt. He must cleanse himself of impurity and overcome imperfection. He must bathe in the light, as it were, to eradicate ignorance. As a "Son of the Light" he believes everything that is imperfect to be of the darkness.  
  
Malkuth sits between the two pillars known to Masons as "Jachin" and "Boaz." Therefore, the sphere or sephira of Malkuth is the analog of Masonic temples and lodges of light that have their portals _between_ two pillars. The temple represents the entrance of Malkuth. The number of Malkuth is 10. This number is written as TEN that obviously connotes ATEN or ATON. This is the reason why the headquarters of the British government is at TEN Downing Street.

![Picture](https://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/3621709.jpg)

The light or knowledge at this low level is so weak in magnitude and so far removed from the realm of pure spirit that only exceptionally wise and morally hygienic individuals can comprehend reality as it really is and see beyond the myriad illusions that infest the world and lower mind. These are the _pneumatic_ rather than the hedonic types. They are _vocational_ rather than merely occupational and recreational beings. They alone understand what is going on, and how left-brain systems stand in _opposition_ to those of the deeper hemispheres of consciousness. They alone understand why the light and power wielded by agents of the Demiurge is always contextualized by difference, opposition and separation. Light in this mode cannot be true and real. It is by definition weak, transitory and illusory.  
  
The Book of Revelation implicitly refers to the two kinds of light. The number 666 - esoteric number of the sun - and the number 144,000 represent the false and true light, as well as the uninitiated or profane mind versus the initiated sacred mind. Interestingly, both numbers have 9 as their digital root.

In Egypt and other lands kings were crowned between the pillars or in front of one or other of them. In this way they represented the sun at the half way position between the Akhet or twin horizons. The twin globes also represent the earth and celestial sphere. The black and white squares represent ignorance and knowledge, overworld and underworld. Occult knowledge has long been associated with light but not in the way we commonly believe. Setian-Atonists worship light not for what it reveals but for what it _conceals._ They are disciples of the _dark side of the sun._ Their chosen forms of private worship proceeds behind a _veil of light._ We are told this loudly enough, but in a symbolic manner. Note the checkered floor pattern. Sadly, the dark side of the sun is not a concept that interests anyone other than Atonists and Architects of Control, so I need not waste ink saying anything more about it. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html) & [Here](https://infogalactic.com/info/Akhet_(hieroglyph_and_season)) for more...)  <br>  <br>_The Children of Seth set up two steles on which the science of astronomy was inscribed_ - S. F. Dunlop  <br>  <br>_The place where the Pillars of Seth are said to have stood, is called Siriad, which may be taken to mean the place of Anubis, who marked the solstitial or midsummer sun, and it is therefore the region of the abode of the sun_ - William Stirling (_The Canon_)  <br><br>---|

What do we learn from all this? What do the Black Lodge's sorcerers know about minds and light that we do not? From what we read here it stands to reason that the light and phallicism wielded by occult societies is that which emanates from the left-brain or psychic Demiurge. This hemisphere is the servant that has overthrown its master in order to usurp its place and function. The servant's _pseudo-reality_ has replaced reality, although the former is brightly lit and full of distraction and promise for the infantile minds born into it.  
  
The left-brain's or ego's inhibitory function is well known to neurologists who note that the corpus callosum connecting the left and right hemispheres is larger and more dense in males, resulting in less harmonization and communication between hemispheres. Hence the connection between masculinity and left-brain cognition. Although the existence of the left-brain's functions makes us conscious, there's a lot more to the advent of the ego and Self than neurologists presently understand. They fail to address what kind of consciousness - now repressed - would exist without the draconian oppressiveness and exclusion of the left-brain. They fail to address the impoverished phantasmagoria presented by the left-brain, which omits everything in reality that threatens its dominion and expansion. They are for the most part apologists for the left-brain's refracted chimera. It's not conducive for them to question their master's authorized edition of reality.  
  
It is clear, therefore, that our hallucinatory vision of the world as a concrete material manifestation, and our fixation on phallic and ithyphallic phenomena, indicate our enslavement to the left-brain's preferred but contrived mode of cognition. Our fixations on dualism and language (particularly metaphorical language) are also indicative of this. The power and force we commonly associate with light and phallic sexuality is a power inferior to that of the right-brain and deeper hemispheres of consciousness. But this deeper more numinous flow of Spirit is invisible to us due to left-brain editing. It is also unknown due to our insensitivity, brought about by our reliance on misleaders in society, and our chronic craving for the approval of the misguided.

|---|Like the Manicheans and other related sects, the Gnostics had a glimmer of the truth but ultimately got it wildly wrong. The split between reality and pseudo-reality isn't a metaphysical problem as much as it is a neurological and epistemological one. It's a condition of our minds and brains. Satan the Demiurge isn't a disembodied supernatural archon ruling over the universe or a series of degraded universes, it's the servant in the head which usurped the role of its master. (See my [Path of the Fool](https://unslaved.com/category/unslaved/premium-members/premium-videos/path-of-the-fool/) series for a thorough explanation of Gnosticism.)|---|

Genesis tells us that the male _preceded_ the female, Adam gives birth to Eve. Millions believed it. As far as the left-brain is concerned, it came _before_ the right-brain. The more absurd the story, the more we believe it. There doesn't seem to have been much progress after all.  
  
_A deity who was alone, not by choice but because there were no other companions for Him, was a concept without parallel in human society. The god of the Israelites did not have a wife, a son, a daughter, or a mother_ - Leonard Shlain


**Visible Spirit**

_...nature is nothing but the organ of self-consciousness, and everything in nature is only necessary because only through such a nature can self-consciousness be achieved_ - Friedrich SchellingSince the left-brain (ego or pseudo-self) projects itself into the future and expects its perfection to come about _tomorrow,_ it finds itself caught in a paradox, because tomorrow does not exist, being merely a projection of the ego. Nevertheless, the reality is that for every step the ego takes toward this phantasmagoria of perfection the more its _imperfection_ is instantiated.  
  
What is really happening is that under the direction of the left-brain (or ego), men have exchanged love for power, and by so doing erect oppressive hierarchies of control in which one is bound to covet and crave increased power and dominance. Although this can be achieved by rising on one's merits, most men find it easier to simply push others down in order to feel high. Most modern hierarchies function in this malignant manner. In fact they are deliberately designed to operate this way, to filter good moral men out, thereby enabling corrupt immoral types to easily ascend to higher levels of world control. Hence the success of authoritarianism and prevalence of master-slave relationships on all levels and in all places.  
  
As I've said elsewhere, culture is the mirror of the ego, whereas nature is the mirror of the Imperial Self. The numinous negentropic intelligence of nature threatens the ego deeply. The latter's power is finite while the universe's energy is infinite. The ego dies while nature is everlasting. In ancient times, before the rise of corrupt religions, the Druids instructed men to revere this infinite power-source and obey nature's ordinances. Their teaching was completely antithetical to that of the many despots and demagogues of later ages, desperate to bring nature under control.  
  
Schelling said that nature is visible spirit, and spirit invisible nature. We can't possibly understand the second part of the profound aphorism until we grasp the meaning of the first part. We do so when we understand Schelling's conception of nature as an immense process by which Spirit realizes itself - God delving into the mystery of _himself_, thereby spontaneously giving rise to nature and all creation as emanations of this august process of Self-realization.  
  
As a manifestation of the desire of Spirit, nature is not to be seen as separate to Spirit. On the contrary, nature is Spirit in a certain dynamic form and aspect, that eventually develops into humans who, as emanations of nature, are the beings in which Spirit, Geist or Logos completes its process of Self-realization. For Goethe, Hegel and Schelling the observation of nature's ways provides the clearest insight into the anatomy of Spirit. The anatomy of the one reveals the anatomy of the other. As Schelling said, "come to physics and see the eternal."  
  
For these Idealists, light is the numinous connective tissue between the spiritual and natural. It is so to speak the radiant "DNA" infusing the universe and animating the physiosphere, biosphere and noosphere. Its origin is, however, beyond them all.

| Doctor Robert Fludd (1574-1637) was an alchemist, astrologer and Rosicrucian. We see him "illumined" by the rays of the sun. He is a Prince of Light. His father worked for Queen Elizabeth I, and was a high ranking court official.  <br>  <br>Fludd's right hand cryptically connotes the letter "W," which stands for the constellation known as Cassiopeia, which is shaped like a large letter "W." The "Cassiopeans" include Dr. John Dee, Edward Kelley, Tycho Brahe, Fludd, and a host of other British and European sorcerers of the sixteenth century. In the year 1572 Cassiopeia was strangely lit for a period, fascinating Dee, Fludd, Edward Kelley, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Philip Sidney, and their illustrious stargazing associates. It is likely that the Cassiopeans believed a new era of light had begun, and that they were its alumni.

**Conclusion**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_The current body of accumulated data makes it difficult to sustain the modern assumption that the universe as a whole is best understood as a blind, mechanistic phenomenon of ultimately random processes with which human consciousness is fundamentally incoherent, and in which the Earth and human beings are ultimately peripheral and insignificant_ – Richard Tarnas (_Cosmos and Psyche_)|

These facts about light, mind, nature and Spirit are alien to us because we have, in our present solarized technocratic world, successfully divided reality into a myriad conflicting parts and have instigated unsustainable authoritarian meritocracies bearing no resemblance to the _holarchic_ structure of nature. The sociopolitical nightmare is merely the external reproduction of our psychic imbalance, brought about by the left-brain's subversion of the right-brain's holistic vision of nature's true nature.  
  
Like crazed Robinson Crusoes we reign supreme over our desacralized island-universes, believing ourselves to be ever so civilized, enlightened and progressive. The situation will only degrade and worsen until we return to nature with a deepened sensitivity, thereby banishing the false light generated by the left-brain.

||_…thinking which does not start from and continue in close relation to its foundations in the physical universe must lead to falsity_ - Alvin Boyd Kuhn|

Perhaps Mahatma Gandhi was right when he cynically said that civilization would be "a good idea," and perhaps sociologist Konrad Lorenz was right when he humorously speculated that man is merely the missing link between apes and human beings. Perhaps, in persisting with our vain compulsion to repair what isn't broken and improve upon perfection, we have finally lost our vision of the inherent order and beauty around us that is not plugged-in, wasteful or finite, and which operates flawlessly without thought or consciousness as we know it. Our insensitivity prevents us looking deeply into that pristine mirror of nature to see all we are and should be.
