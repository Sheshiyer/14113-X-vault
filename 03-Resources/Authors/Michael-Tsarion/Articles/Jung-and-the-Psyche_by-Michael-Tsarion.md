## Jung's Revolutionary Genius

There can be no doubt that the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung was one of the world's greatest thinkers. Most professionals in the field of psychology recognize that his genius lay primarily in his insightful revisions of Sigmund Freud's basic theories about the origin and function of the psyche. This presupposes that Jung had a thorough working understanding of his mentor's teachings on the subject.

I will not bother rehashing the whole story of the relationship and eventual disagreements between Freud and Jung, nor allude to the genesis and evolution of Jung's school of Analytical Psychology, since those details are available on many online sites and encyclopedias. Nor will I delve here into his complex theory of Personality Typology.

What I should like to remind modern readers about are the four major discoveries Jung detailed throughout his masterworks, namely the **Collective Unconscious**, the **Archetypes**, the process of **Individuation** and **Objective Psyche**. Separately and together they are relevant to *everything* happening in today's world, on personal and social levels. Indeed, one is not off the mark when claiming that every aspect of both Freud's and Jung's teachings contain the answers and solutions - in total - to our chaotic world's problems. It should fill our hearts with dread that their superlative findings should fall foul of our penchant for historical amnesia.

It should also fill us with foreboding that their work has been systematically defaced and undermined by cunning Postmodernists desperate to misrepresent their ideas.

> **Historical Context:** Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) and Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961). The introvert and the extrovert. Separating from Freud, in 1912, caused the young Carl to suffer a nervous breakdown. It was only with the greatest difficulty that he became a thinker in his own right.

## The Postmodernist Assault

Deconstructionists are particularly incensed by Jung's corpus. This is because he had much to say about them and their anarchic agenda. Crypto-Nihilists of their kind were on the top of his personal list of world-destroyers. He knew all there was to know about their psychological typology. His writings on these anarchic desecrators of the past are perceptive and accurate.

Something had to be done, and it was. It is not wild speculation to say that, if academics have their way, we won't have any interest in the great man's profound work. Nor will we be in a position to mentally comprehend or physically apply the solutions he offered for our survival and wellbeing. Not after the Marcusan-Fabians are through polluting his work. Whereas Freud and Jung were interested only in healing, their enemies - the enemies of humanity - are interested only in spreading contagion which compromises our existence on all levels.

## The Problem of Modern Jungians

The problem does not end there. Sadly, latter-day "Jungians" are for the most part a hopeless lot. Few do justice to Jung's work. The chief exceptions were his contemporaries Erich Neumann, James Hillman and Edward Edinger. These writers, and a few others, have dutifully honored their master's work. But they are the exception rather than the rule. As time passed, things have worsened. Modern-day People's Champions, such as the almighty Jordan Peterson, are poor exponents of Jung's superlative insights.

> **Warning:** Although there is no end to People's Champions and popular social pundits clogging the airwaves, sadly none can be trusted to do justice to seminal thinkers of the past. Better to go straight to the *originals*. Men such as Freud and Jung left no stone unturned in their quest for truth. They offered effective remedies and solutions for today's problems, which they astutely foresaw and diagnosed. *Beware the scavengers and pretenders!*

## The Four Major Discoveries

> *"Man has developed consciousness slowly and laboriously, in a process that took untold ages to reach the civilized state…And this evolution is far from complete, for large areas of the human mind are still shrouded in darkness"* - Carl Jung

Each of Jung's four discoveries have an enormous impact not only on the thought and practices of specialists in the fields of psychology, sociology and philosophy, but on every other field imaginable. They effect neurology, psychiatry, anthropology, history, ecology, ethics, politics, aesthetics, drama and literature.

Jung's first major discovery was that of the **Collective Unconscious**. It is more accurate to say the *content* of the Collective Unconscious, given that it is this mysterious content which shapes ego-consciousness.
