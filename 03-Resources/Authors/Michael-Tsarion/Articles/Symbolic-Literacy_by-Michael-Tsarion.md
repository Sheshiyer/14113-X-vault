## The Hidden Poison in Our Midst

Due to chronic symbol illiteracy, we live our lives largely unaware of a great poison in our midst, something that has a profoundly negative effect on our conscious and unconscious selves. This is the use of subliminal persuasion in media and advertising. Subliminal and subtextual persuasion of this pernicious kind constitutes nothing less than a **psychic dictatorship**. It involves the deliberate subversive manipulation and public purveyance of words, images, numbers, colors, sounds and symbols which are subsequently directed, via ubiquitous media oracles, toward limbic areas of the brain. The toxic torrent also readjusts brain wave states, putting one in a mental frequency suitable to the ad-men.

## The Artifice of Media Persuaders

The artifice of Media Persuaders relies on insidious cryptic language deliberately designed to disturb our capacity to differentiate between fantasy and reality. This artifice serves to stimulate compulsive urges and base appetites, which in turn causes cognitive and somatic conflict, gradually shutting down higher centers of reason, discernment and self-control.

Constant exposure to subliminal content serves to undermine healthy drives. It subverts our moral sensibility and ultimately arrests psychological maturation. The devastating effects of this subversion has rarely been explored in depth. It has yet to be recognized by the public at large, who - being victims of chronic symbol illiteracy - are unshielded against the constant barrage of subliminal content permeating their minds, causing a nightmare list of physical and psychic disorders.

## The Television Addiction Crisis

> **Alarming Statistics:** Robert D. McIlwraith of the University of Manitoba states that the main attraction of television-watching is not the content of programming, but a dependency on the medium itself...The volume of television-watching in the United States might be seen as indicative of an addiction. It is estimated by the Smithsonian Institute that the average American household has the television on seven and a half hours per day. The average American watches twenty-five hours of television per week. The average preschool child watches television about twenty-eight hours per week, and the average elementary school age child watches twenty-four hours per week. By the completion of high school, a child can be expected to have watched 15,000 hours of television-far more than the child's accumulated hours of classroom time and more than any other activity except sleep. - Ronald Schenk (Spirit in the Tube)

## Targeting the Young

The alarming existential chaos which the young presently experience, though deplored and ignored, serves as a direct indictment of the symbolic subversion I expose. The thinking of the young tends to be influenced by the limbic brain and as such the young respond with greater zeal to the perverse symbolic images and messages infesting their environment. The invasive, clandestinely directed content is designed to subvert a child's fragile moral conscience and rational filter. The consequences of this psychic dictatorship are devastating.

## The Unconscious Processing of Symbols

> **Scientific Evidence:** 
> - *"...research has shown that in the first few milliseconds of our perceiving something we do not only unconsciously comprehend what it is, but decide whether we like it or not; the cognitive unconscious presents our awareness with not just the identity of what we see, but an opinion about it. Our emotions have a mind of their own, one which can hold views quite independently of our rational mind"* - Daniel Goleman (Emotional Intelligence)

## The Corporate Agenda of Dehumanization

Subliminal messages permeate television programs, computer games, magazines, billboards, products and musical productions. They are, however, not limited to the ambience of the young. They are just one of the weapons in the arsenal of psychopathic corporations whose *modus operandi* not only concerns profit but **dehumanization** in an Orwellian sense. All that is wholesomely aesthetic, traditional and cultural stands in the way of their inhuman agenda; their relentlessly aggressive efforts at reducing the human race to a body of narcissistic, sense-infatuated, desensitized, amoral and delinquent "smiling depressives."

## The Corporate Psychopathy

> **Revealing Admissions:**
> - *"I think we are destroying the minds of America and that has been one of my lifelong ambitions"* - John Kricfalusi (creator of the Ren and Stimpy Show)
> 
> - *"The language of business is not a language of the soul or the language of humanity. It's a language of indifference, it's a language of separation, secrecy and hierarchy"* - Anita Rodderick (creator of the Body Shop)
> 
> - *"...the corporation remains as it was at the time of its origins, as a mad business institution in the middle of the nineteenth century, and legally designated 'person' designed to valorize self interest and invalidate moral concern. Most people would find its 'personality' abnormal, even psychopathic, in a human being, yet curiously we accept it in society's most powerful institutions"* - Joel Bakan (The Corporation)

## The Elite Behind the Manipulation

Business is business we say; people are merely selling their products. If only this were true. A little research and objective observation tells a different tale. The elite at the top of the world's major advertising agencies are extraordinarily educated and intuitive people trained by private schools and prestigious think tanks.
