_Child abuse is still sanctioned in our society as long as it is defined as child-rearing_ - Alice Miller  

That driver is a maniac. That woman is hysterical. My workmate is bipolar. That freakin’ neighbor is neurotic. My teach is a narcissist. The coach is a sadist. My roommate is obsessive-compulsive. The CEO is a bloody psychopath.  
   
Where do we get off attributing these highly technical terms to those we don’t like? From where do we learn this habit?  
   
These terms – the nomenclature of institutionalized psychiatry – are used more and more to categorize and demean people around us. Indeed, their original usage was not very savory or rational, since they sufficed to give doctors and psychiatrists a sense of superiority over those unfortunates in the waiting room.  
  
Once a poor specimen has been categorized – as psychotic, schizophrenic, antisocial or insane, etc – they are absorbed, as it were, into a system that effectively “processes” them like so many sausages or crackers. They are systematically _dehumanized_ with or without their approval. The are deemed "invalids" - or more correctly, as _invalidated_.

How long have you been feeling homicidal?  

The thing with the white coat and private personalized parking space covets this feeling of superiority. As a proverbial pen-pusher and hoop-jumper they are bound to consider themselves, and the system they represent, distinctly superior to their sorry brood of oddball patients, who by and large have already been deemed unsuitable by society. If the patient or inmate thinks of themselves as a failure, all the better for everyone involved. His place at the very bottom of the inhuman hierarchy is assured  
  
The patient finds himself further demoted on the scale of humanity by his appointed diagnostician. If he doesn’t watch out, with a gut full of meds he may find himself pulverized by the wheels of the justice system, condemned for such and such a felony, and incarcerated in a psych ward. He may not realize he's part of a society determined to equate moral deviance and evil with “mental disease,” regardless of the absurdity of the theory.

It’s all too familiar today. But what's it all about? Surely we aren’t being told that pathological types, like the rest of us, are born with _equal_ aptitudes and characteristics, and that with "therapy" they  are sure to be healed, rehabilitated and sent back into society. If so, are we also told that society itself is schizogenic, and that it breeds insanity? I guess we missed that lecture.  
  
The understated notion is that we are all essentially "equal." Otherwise what happens to the fundamental precepts of Materialism? Hasn’t the scientific community firmly bitten down on John Locke’s theory of _Tabula Rasa_ or Blank Mind? Or has this theory been discarded when we weren’t looking? Surely not.  

[![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/locke_orig.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke)

English Materialist philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) whose philosophy tended to equalize humanity. Accordingly, most Materialists should by definition assert that moral deviancy and pathology are due to _external_ causes such as insufficient nurture. Once again, as in so many other areas, we find internal contradictions drastically weakening the case for Materialism and Scientism. There's not a scientist anywhere who addresses the phenomenon of Adultism. Being victims of Adultism themselves, they may be constitutionally incapable of confronting it and seeing it in themselves. Paradoxically, the advance of science is _impeded_ by the scientist. More importantly, if Materialists truly honor Locke's assessment of consciousness, why don't they weigh in against endemic Adultism and parental ineptitude _causing_ inequality? Why do science and psychiatry not make it _top_ priority if they're so interested in improving the state of the world? Starting with children and _their_ world is logical and scientific, right? I guess not.  

No! The dogma of Materialism still dominates mainstream institutions, with the majority of scientists proudly ascribing to it.  
  
So despite their error in this regard, Materialists haven't run out of steam. Their error-ridden ideology remains firmly ensconced throughout the world.  
  
So, again, what’s going on?  
   
The answer is simple. If Materialists are not anti-Adultism, they must be pro-Adultism. It's quite logical, since all scientists were once children themselves, many of them brought up by necrophilous parents with whom they learned to identify. They've inured themselves to _enforced inequality_ regardless of their core intellectual precepts. Ergo their indifference and lack of motivation in ascribing it to parental ineptitude. Their reluctance means that young people's suffering will not be brought to an end.  
  
The average scientist and psychiatrist are bound to be disciples of Adultism not critics of it. With their capitulation the tyrannous rule of the necrophilous parent surges full speed ahead. Maybe talk of demons isn't that wacky after all.  
  
Indeed, the white-coated physician - the GP, counselor or psychiatrist - is nothing more than a super-parent dealing with overgrown children who in their infancy experienced nothing but endemic inequality_,_ and got to like it. It was not because they were born with _blank_ minds, but because their minds have been misshapen by the disciples of inequality and Adultism. Children are _made_ unequal by those never held accountable.  
  
In the past, the pure theory of blank mind at least held to the idea of human equality. Logically, if each child is born with identical mental and emotional capacities, any aberration occurring throughout infancy and youth could only be due to _external_ phenomena: environment, parenting, peers, society, class status and level of education, etc. If these go wrong somehow, it’s _not_ the child’s fault.  
  
_Bang on...we agree!_ say the organization men: It must be corrected whatever the cost...Bring in the gang of psychiatrists, social-workers and _social engineers..._Everything is under control...Suit up lads...launch rockets!  
  
It sounds good, except for the fact that the social engineers and their deputies are not only adults, but worse - they are disciples of Adultism, right to the core, programmed by their own pasts to defend the cause of necrophilous adults. The psychiatrist's real job, therefore, is to draft the edicts by which terrible parents deny culpability and bury memories of their crimes against innocents in their "care."  
  
Central to their manifesto of domestic tyranny is the ever so holy fifth commandment: _Honor thy father and mother._  
  
Too bad the high and mighty scientist can't see how much damage has been done by keeping and enforcing _this_ commandment, and how much fallout it has bred, for the individual and society.  
  
The average scientist assumes the way of science is an improvement over that of religion. In many ways he's right. Yet, strangely, in our modern secular atheistic world this one religious edict is firmly embedded in the collective brain, scientists not withstanding.

Psychologist Thomas Szasz (1920-2012), author of numerous groundbreaking books on psychiatry and its dangers, predicted the onslaught of Big Pharma and the medicalization of everyday life. His predecessors were Karl Kraus and the great Otto Rank, who also levied insightful critiques against the institution of psychiatry. Rank accused the psychiatrist of being the present-day _priest_. As Szasz put it: _Psychoanalysis is a religion disguised as a science._ In the past man's consciousness was allegedly undermined by demons and devils. Nowadays it's a case of neuro-mythological loose wires in the brain, chemical imbalance, hormonal deficiency and misfiring synapses. It's about "mental disease" and the gargantuan budgets needed to fix it.  

Importantly, one unforeseen benefit of the Lockean hypothesis is that it denies dysfunctional parents the luxury of citing past lives, reincarnation, karma, possession or original sin, and making unprovable claims about  _inherited_ evil, these being cunning ruses to justify lack of love and care from parents toward a child. (Many mothers are known to have murdered their children because they believed them "possessed by the devil.")  
  
Ironically, Locke's fundamental tenet of Materialism has been violated time and again by dyed in the flesh Materialists. This is because of its ethical ramifications. It's not something conducive to disclaiming moms and dads looking for any excuse to justify their crimes against the juveniles in their care.  
  
It doesn't serve inept parents diagnosing their naturally quiet, introverted, self-reliant children as defective, psychopathic or evil, and therefore unlovable.

Swiss child psychologist Alice Miller (1923-2010) the greatest exposer of chronic Adultism and parental hypocrisy who ever lived. She held that no child is born evil.  

_The victimization of children is nowhere forbidden; what is forbidden is to write about it_ - Alice Miller  
  
As Alice Miller, and other enlightened therapists and researchers noted, deviant parents are all too eager to justify their horrendous failures by declaring their children _unlovable_. Regrettably, its an offense that is never punished or corrected. Parents get away with it every time.  
   
It’s a ploy that not only works wonders domestically, but one that has been overwhelmingly accepted institutionally, given that the unloved child becomes grist for Big Pharma's diabolically inhuman mill.  
  
The quiet, contemplative introvert can now be labelled withdrawn, cold, defiant or evil, and justifiably punished and pushed away. No matter that it is the _parent_ who is inept, indifferent, extroverted, superficial, self-absorbed, condescending and cruel. We’ll never hear anyone admit it, because the average parent suffers from chronic self-deceptiveness as well as compulsive superiority. With society's blessing, their "get out of jail free card" works every time. Let the tyranny commence.  
  
In years past, before the advent of psychiatry, a parent could always stoop to outright demonization. “I can’t love this horrid child…it doesn’t respond naturally…it never cries or correctly acknowledges my presence…it doesn’t play with its siblings or show emotion…I’m not inclined to take little Mary in my arms like I do other kids…There’s no point caring for her…she's too wrapped up in her own world...I don't know what's wrong…There must be something _you_ can do to straighten her out...”  
  
What a shot in the arm for today's Adultist to be offered a arsenal of tongue-twisting terms from the DMS-V and other manuals of psychiatry.  
  
How splendid that millions of petty dictators are armed with new highfalutin phraseology allowing them to hide their ineptitude and perfidy.  
  
What a coup for psychiatrists to be handed permission to medicate the "antisocial" child and press for the medicalization of everyday life.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/prisschildhood.jpg?1598458694)

Adultism thrives because not only are most children incapable of articulating their opinions, but are wont in all cases to blame _themselves_ for making unloving parents unhappy and oppressive. This tendency emboldens a tyrannous parent's already inflated superiority complex. Due to chronic Adultism, most children are unable to work out whether their parents desire them to be dependent or independent. They are forever trying to navigate the tempests of adult ambivalence and irrationality and are usually the brunt of adult frustration.  

Now, a child – like Mary Flora Bell, Jesse Pomeroy, Beth Thomas, Eric M. Smith, Josh Philips, Sandy Charles, Kip Kinkel, Joe Clark, Kyle Davies, Luke Woodham, Daniel Bartlam, and many, many others (some guilty of _matricide_) – might easily find themselves the victim of extreme Adultism in deep collusion with psychiatric institutions itching to administer anti-psychotic drugs which finally drive them into diabolically criminal behavior.  
  
An honest investigation of current child delinquency and criminality proves this beyond all possible doubt. Scientists acknowledge the effects (good for them) but couldn't care less about the _causes._

_All anxieties tranquilized. Meds not psychology please!!!_  

Over and over, in cases of teen suicide and homicide, absolutely no mention is made of the adverse effects of mind- and mood-altering medication. Experts are clearly under gag-orders from Big Pharma. This reticence is covered up by subtly or overtly _blaming the child_ for everything. He or she is wholly guilty, whereas the parent is all good and nothing but good. The fifth commandment is _never_ accosted or broken.

Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, the youngest murderers in modern history. _Demons_ made them do it, not parents, right? (Click image for more...)  

The enlightened observer knows that children are _not_ born equal. No one is. But beside this abstract point, the infant stands to have his or her personality permanently arrested and deformed by the behavior of necrophilous parents and caregivers.  
  
The parent is the sole reason for perverse characteristics in a child, and sadly our schizogenic society still hasn’t embraced this fact. Probably, it never will. There’s too much at stake and too many centuries of parental criminality to conceal. Too many incompetent present-day parents stand to be accused for enforcing the fifth commandment guaranteeing their unearned superiority.  
  
Although the parent's ruthless will rules supreme in the home and psychiatrist’s office, the incompetent parent is incapable of diagnosing their own  pathological condition, their _emotional plague_ and moral inferiority. They are certainly not inclined to trace their dysfunction to their own childhood treatment.

In the past, the inept parent could accuse a child of being a changeling or of being possessed. Today, they can simply accuse the introverted self-reliant child of being unloving and hence _unlovable_.  
  
They'll get away with it for sure. Society sees to it. The unfortunate infant or adolescent can be justifiably alienated, spurned, mistreated and even incarcerated with state approval. The parent need only dial up the local Inquisitor General in the form of the social-worker, counselor or psychiatrist, and demand “happy pills” and maybe a few doses of "mother's little helper."  
  
Nice to know the criminals are in charge of the investigation.  
  
_Psychologists who study the moral development of children typically have confined their investigations of aberrant behavior to why children lie and steal. Virtually no important studies have been made about the psychological development of children who become involved in serious violence. As a result, psychologists and criminologists cannot accurately point to those youngsters or even adults who are the most prone to violence_ - Carl Goldberg

Beth Thomas, poster-child for the homicidal parent-hating  type. Where's the science to identify and study her plight in the "Dragon Fight" with her mother, who was for whatever reason probably seething with envy and hatred toward her young daughter? Where's the scientific data on the effects and aftereffects of emotional incest? ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_of_Rage) & [Here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=child+of+rage) for more...)  

_The truth will set us free, while lies unite us_ – Thomas Szasz  
  
Yes, it's a glorious set-up. After all, how can we falsify the testimony of said parent? How can we doubt a Terrible  Mother’s protestations against her invalid (_invalidated_) child. How do we accuse her of neglect if she's the victim finding it impossible to love and care for a unresponsive or defiant child?  
  
We’re likely to accept her words and lament her distress. Remember, the little horror isn't eloquent or aware enough to state their side of it. They are conveniently _defenseless._  
  
The child's job is to sit still and accept their jailer's profile and testimony. One's masters define the problem, accuse the malefactor and administer the “cure,” whether the offender likes it or not.  
  
With state support the terrible parent’s tyrannous reign and behavior is conveniently stricken from the record. “It is for the child’s own good.” It’s holy writ, never forget it. The authorities have spoken.  
  
My child is evil and unlovable...He needs treatment...I hope you all agree...  
  
...Who says so? _I do._  
  
Can this be falsified? Conveniently, no it can’t. Smiles all round. Let the tanks roll.  
  
Since children do not write instructional guides for parents - and have probably never been asked to do so - we see the crux of the problem. We see that it is no wonder why solutions to the problem of Adultism have been so slow in coming.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/teendelinq.jpeg?1598458759)

The average parent - competent or incompetent - will react saying that they have the life-experience the juvenile does not, and are therefore quite justified in their stern treatment of offspring. In reality, this "experience" can be a major detriment rather than a help in child-rearing. One has had plenty of time to learn the art of self-deception and hypocrisy. One has experienced their relative insignificance and mediocrity, and mastered _self-injurious_ attitudes. One has lived long enough to lose all sense of self-esteem and process their own childhood trauma via their innocent defenseless kids. _Top marks!_  

All the domestic tyrant requires for their criminality to proceed is the endorsement of a society made up of the sworn disciples of Adultism. With psychiatry’s help, the home becomes a state approved asylum, breeding a generation of constitutional moral inferiors dead to themselves and the world in which they're condemned to remain prisoners of childhood.
