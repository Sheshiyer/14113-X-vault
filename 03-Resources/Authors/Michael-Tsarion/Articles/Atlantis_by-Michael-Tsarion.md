I will create a primitive:  
Man shall be his name.  
I shall create a primitive worker,  
He will be charged with service to the gods,  
That they might have their ease  
(Sumerian Creation Epic)

SUMMARY**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|It took man over a million years to progress from using stones as he found them to the realization that they could be chipped and flaked to better purpose. It then took another 500,000 years before Neanderthal man mastered the concept of stone tools, and a further 50,000 years before crops were cultivated and metallurgy was discovered. Hence, by all scales of evolutionary reckoning, we should still be as far removed from any basic understanding of mathematics, engineering or science - But here we are, only 7,000 years later, landing probes on Mars…So, how did we inherit this wisdom, and from whom?   - Laurence Gardner|---|

|---|It is said that those ones were created and shaped, they had no father, they had no mother, yet they were called men. They were not born of woman, they were not produced by creators and shapers, nor by Alom and Caholom, only by a miracle, by magic were they created and shaped  <br>  <br>     - Popul Vuh|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|The words of the blessing of Enoch, wherewith he blessed the elect and righteous, who will be living in the day of tribulation, when all the wicked and godless are to be removed. And he took up his parable and said - Enoch a righteous man, whose eyes were opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the angels showed me, and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for this generation, but for a remote one which is for to come  <br>  <br>   - The Book of Enoch|---|

|---|Then two huge men appeared to me, the like of which I had never seen on earth. Their faces were like the shining sun; their eyes were like burning lamps; from their mouths fire was coming forth...their wings were more glistening that gold; their hands were whiter than snow…And they took me up onto their wings, and carried me up to the first heaven, and placed me on the clouds. And, behold, they were moving. There, I perceived the air higher up, and higher still, I saw the ether  <br>  <br>   - Second Book of Enoch|---|

|---|She said to me "O my master and brother, recall for yourself my pregnancy. I swear to you by the Great Holy One, by the Ruler of Heaven, that this pregnancy is from you, that from you is the planting of this fruit, and that it is not from any alien, or _from any of the Watchers, or from any heavenly being_"  <br>  <br>   - The Genesis Apocryphon|---|

|---|The appellation Satan, in Hebrew, and Adversary…belongs by right to the first and cruelest Adversary of all other gods, Jehovah, not in the serpent which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom  <br>  <br>   - H. P. Blavatsky|---|

|---|All traditional cultures believe that they are descended from gods, god-like humans such as the ancestors or divine animals - many of whom came from the sky  <br>  <br>   - Patrick Harpur|---|

|---|Almost every culture preserves myths describing humanity’s endurance of terrible past events involving major loss of life on a global scale...Nothing in our modern experience comes close to matching these stories of global disaster.  <br>  <br>   - Paul A. LaViolette|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|The Sumerian deities and the Babylonian Marduk had created the human race to ‘serve the gods.’ Yahweh created the man to ‘till the ground’ of the earth, to ‘dress and keep’ the garden: ‘And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it’ (Gen 2:15)  <br>  <br>   - Baring & Cashford (_The Myth of the Goddess_)|---|

|---|Zeus gathered the gods in council to express his concern that these unusual creatures would one day challenge their hegemony. He was loath to exterminate them with his thunderbolts, though, because there would be no one to bring the gods offerings. He solved the problem by putting each creature into a trance and then splitting it down the middle…Upon awakening, each half only dimly remembered what it had been prior to being cleft in two. Zeus explained to the assembled gods and goddesses the cleverness of his scheme. These creatures would no longer pose a threat to the gods, because they would dissipate their considerable energy by spending the rest of their days searching for their missing halves  <br>  <br>   - Leonard Shlain (recounting Plato’s Symposium account)|---|
