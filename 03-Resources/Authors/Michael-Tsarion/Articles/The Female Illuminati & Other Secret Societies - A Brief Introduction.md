|_There are numbers of these mystic Brotherhoods which have naught to do with “civilized” countries, and it is in their unknown communities that are concealed the skeletons of the past. These “adepts” could, if they chose, lay claim to strange ancestry_ – H. P. Blavatsky|

People establish and join secret societies because they seek power. Once they've achieved great power as well as wealth, they sometimes want to brag about it and let others know about their special status. To further this desire, members of secret societies - from Jesuits to Satanists - make use of the media. Highly financed movies are made to communicate to us on a non-verbal level. These movies are often ostensibly based on the books of commissioned writers, themselves lower-level agents of powerful secret societies.  
  
Hollywood movies occasionally provide us with keyhole visions into what’s going on behind the scenes; although not enough for laymen and symbolically illiterate people to decipher and understand. It’s why so many people remain ignorant about secret societies and their ways.  
  
However, if we do a little serious research, it becomes easier to see what is going on. This process is occasionally helped by whistle-blowing movies from Hollywood and other media orgs, movies such as Brotherhood of the Bell, To the Devil a Daughter, The Devil Rides Out, The Omen, Bladerunner, Freejack, Judge Dread, Fifth Element, Tombraider, The Formula, James Bond, The Da Vinci Code, National Treasure, Skulls, Eyes Wide Shut, Ninth Gate, Golden Eye, and so on. As I said, perhaps we are deliberately BEING TOLD what is going on by the elites themselves. It’s an intriguing thought.  
  
Of course the serious researcher does not simply base his work on media extravaganzas. My own work on secret societies is based on sources, and I strengthen my ideas with numerous statements and quotes from insiders and those who have made a deep study of secret society symbolism. In other words, the existence of secret fraternities is documented fact. Happily, if paradoxically, secret societies publish their own works which provide us with key insights into their origins and agendas.  
  
After studying material of this kind I eventually gained greater insight into the workings of the world’s major secret societies – the Freemasons, Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, Knights of Malta, Jesuits, Illuminati, Black Nobility, etc.  
  
Additionally, the artwork I decipher is that which hangs in their own clubs and lodges, and in famous shrines such as the House of the Temple in Washington DC. Interesting artwork is to be found in plenty throughout the world’s many masonic halls that stand in almost every major town and city, casually passed and ignored by most people as they go about their business. A study of the friezes and reliefs outside masonic structures also furnished me with insight into the subtle manner in which insiders non-verbally communicate with us.  
  
I learned to go even further, and observe the many clock towers, statues, fountains, murals, floors and obelisks, etc, which exist in major towns and cities. I discovered that most cities are ritually laid out and have a more esoteric purpose than one might guess. (See my book [The Trees of Life: Exposing the Art of Holy Deception](http://www.amazon.com/Trees-Life-Exposing-Holy-Deception-ebook/dp/B007OE2TI6/ref=la_B00IXHW9V0_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435533391&sr=1-7), for more on this subject.)  
  
As to the power of secret societies, we must accept that it is considerable. Even eminent mainstream historians confirm it. After doing nearly thirty years of research into these matters, I realized the extent of their sociopolitical power. I also realized that most of their operations would not receive public approval. This is partly why they prefer anonymity. Although their identities may not be secret, their rites, behavior and designs for world control are kept in the dark and out of sight to ordinary men and women. They make good use of hierarchies and fixed degree ceremonies to ensure that only the “right” kind of person gets to be an insider. Their recruiting fraternities are found in every major university and college. Their lower and higher members surround us in every school, university, corporation, livery company and charity.  
  
Uncovering and following their criminal footprints demands labor. You cannot wait for them to come out into the open. You must go into your streets with open eyes and ask yourself - Who built Bath? Who built London? Who built Washington DC, Cologne and Paris? You might not understand completely all the secrets of these fraternities, but you can eventually realize that something strange has been going from the year dot. You’ll realize the tremendous financial power that exists, out of reach of the common man. And you’ll realize the time it took to attain such power. In the end you’ll be more aware of the presence and prestige of the equestrian and chivalric orders that infest our world. You’ll understand how their many lower-level branches and fraternities work to filter out moral men and promote immoral and amoral ones.  
  
Ask questions such as: how did a small country like England, since the 16th century, get its predatory talons into so many far off lands, conquering, colonizing and “ruling the waves?” How did a predatory exploitative organization like the Vatican (which is more than the center of the Roman Catholic religion) gain so much power? Why does it still exist after the heinous historical crimes of which it is guilty - more than 500 years of the persecution of so called “witches,” who were just ordinary women doing their thing - healing, learning about nature’s ways, knowing the secrets of herbalism and agriculture, etc. We are talking about nearly nine million victims of total deliberate slaughter. And that series of atrocities is just a single instance of the pestilence of this Roman branch of the ancient Setian-Atonist "Black Lodge" exposed throughout my works. To get away with it, and remain above the law, takes considerable power doesn’t it? Right! So what’s different when it comes to the existence of even more elusive and sinister orders?

The Vatican is allied with numerous secret orders, such as the Rosicrucians, Jesuits, Knights of Malta, Knights of Columbus, Order of Christ, Scottish Rite, Grand Orient, Opus Dei, and of course the Knights Templar - one of the most powerful organizations in the world. Some of the top degrees of what we know to be Freemasonry are Templar degrees. In the early fourteenth century, when the Templars were suppressed throughout the world, Scottish Rite Masons came to their aid. Most Scottish Rite traditions are undeniably Templaresque.  
  
As we'll see from  the following articles, Templar agents have long existed in secret within the Vatican, College of Cardinals, and other shadowy societies. Their agents - in the form of Rosicrucians, Sabbateans, Frankists, Martinists, Illuminists and Jesuits, etc - have long infiltrated most institutions and societies throughout the Western world.  
  
Above the Templars stands their parent society, the so-called Order of Sion. In my opinion Sionists are a _female_ order served by lower-level male deputies. I lay out the case for this in my program _The Female Illuminati._  
  
Fortunately, warnings about subversive societies went out from men in the know during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Observant insiders, such as Samuel Pritchard, Gérard Encausse, Eliphas Levi, Augustin Barruel, John Robinson, President John Quincy Adams, and others, believed that ostensibly Protestant orders of masonry had been completely undermined by the Templars. Some believe that Protestantism itself was a creation of Rosicrucian agents. Martin Luther's personal notebooks are emblazoned with the Rose and Cross.  
  
Suggestively, these same symbols are found in plenty on earlier Templar graves and architecture. Moreover, in Catholic dominated lodges, such as those of Grand Orient Masonry, degrees known as "Rose Cross" exist, clearly an impossibility if the Rosicrucians were _truly_ a Protestant breakaway sect. What we are subtly being told is that underneath or behind both Catholicism and Protestantism there exists a network of secret societies and cults whose doctrines transcend those of ordinary street-level religions.

||_Around 1530, more than eighty years before the publication of the first manifesto, the association of cross and rose already existed in Portugal in the Convent of the Order of Christ, home of the Knights Templar, later renamed Order of Christ. Three bocetes were, and still are, on the vault of the initiation room. The rose can clearly be seen at the center of the cross_ - Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia (Entry on Roscicrucianism)  <br>  <br>_Documents available in France today contend that an Order of the Rosy Cross was founded in 1188 by a pre-Masonic Templar named Jean de Gisors, vassal of English King Henry II and the first independent grand master of the Order of Sion_ - Jim Marrs (_Rule by Secrecy_)  <br>  <br>_The Order of the Illuminati appears as an accessory to Freemasonry. It is in the Lodges of Freemasons that the Minervals are found, and there they are prepared for Illumination. They must have previously obtained the three English degrees. The founder says more. He says that his doctrines are the only true Freemasonry. He was the chief promoter of the Eclectic System. This he urged as the best method of getting information of all the explanations which have been given of the Masonic Mysteries. He was also a Strict Observance and an adept Rosicrucian_ – John Robinson (_Born in Blood_)  <br>  <br>_The Rosy Cross derived from the Red Cross of the Templars. Mirabeau, who  <br>as a Freemason and an Illuminatus, was in a position to discover many facts  <br>about the secret societies of Germany during his stay in the country, definitely asserts that "the Rose Croix Masons of the seventeenth century were only the ancient Order of the Templars secretly perpetuated_" - Nesta Webster (quoting from Count Mirabeau's _Histoire de la Monarchie Prussienne_)  <br>  <br>_In France the Knights [Templar] who left the Order, henceforth hidden, and  <br>so to speak unknown, formed the Order of the Flaming Star and of the Rose-  <br>Croix, which in the fifteenth century spread itself in Bohemia and  <br>Silesia_ - Lecouteulx de Canteleu  <br>  <br>_Templar graves have been found in several sites in Palestine which contain a carved effigy of a warrior's sword, which itself is a cruciform shape, around which are entwined roses_ - Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe (_The Warriors and the Bankers_)  <br>  <br>_Many writers on the Order of the Rosy Cross have alleged that the fraternity was founded by ex-members of the Templar Order after their suppression by Pope Clement_ - Michael Howard (_Occult Conspiracy_)  <br>  <br>_Freemasonry is either more or less than Rosicrucianism as modified by those who transplanted it into England_ – De Quincey  <br>  <br>_The insignia of a knight of the Order of the Garter consists of a jewelled collar composed of gold and red roses with five petals contained within tiny garters...Hanging from the collar is a representation of St. George, the patron saint of England, killing the dragon -_ ibid|

Clearly the Rosicrucians served as yet one more cover society behind which cunning, far-seeing Templars and Sionists managed to conceal themselves, this time under a Protestant disguise. This was an essential strategy facilitating their subversion of Prussian and British masonry.

|---|_In 1663 a great Masonic Congress was held, at which the famous three degrees were created and a strong Rosicrucian element was introduced into the craft. Around this same time a book appeared, written by a French priest named Depuis, which called upon the Masons to vindicate the Knights Templars, who had been dispersed and suppressed by Philippe Le Bel in the Fourteenth Century. Depuis argued that the Templars were a religious order and that the French monarchy, which had destroyed them, must be made to pay for what it had done_ – Father Clarence Kelly (_Conspiracy Against God and Man_)|

Although the symbol of the red cross was bestowed on the Templars by Pope Eugenius III, it is a symbol that long predates modern times. It was originally employed by the ancient Arya, and is a goddess symbol par excellence. In Greek mythology the god of beauty, Adonis, was transformed into a rose by Venus. The red color of the flower was thereby caused by his blood. Venus is the tutelary deity of the Sisterhood. In this instance the rose symbolizes the power of the female goddess _over_ the male acolyte who sacrificially offers his phallus (and sometimes his life) to her. It was in the twelfth century, during the reign of King Stephen, that the Templar red cross first appeared as the chief heraldic emblem of England.

||St. George was venerated by the Templars who modeled themselves after him. Of course a great deal of esoteric symbolism is involved in the story of St. George and his adventures with females and dragons. Wherever the red cross is found, either on Templar emblems or images of St. George, the reference is to blood. More particularly, in the case of Masonry and Templarism it represents emasculation, the removal (ritually or physically) of the phallus. Note the proximity of the princess (with red dress) and St. George's foot on the troublesome dragon. The dragon represents the sexual urges that allegedly bar the way to service and enlightenment. Monks shaved their heads into a tonsure to represent their own celibacy, and Jews took to wearing the yarmulke to symbolize theirs. This physical or symbolic celibacy makes sense only in regards worship of the Mother Goddess. When we see images of the god Mithras slaying the bull, the underlying implication is, as in the case of St. George and his dragon, _castration_.||

|---|We see that the concept of the Holy Blood does not have much to do with the Christian Jesus. That is just a convenient cover. The Templars have recently reminded us of this through Dan Brown's extravaganza _The Da Vinci Code,_ where it is Mary and protagonist Sophie who take center stage in the drama. In the movie's ending scene we are left in no doubt who is of central importance for all concerned. Just before the hero arrives above the subterranean crypt of Mary Magdalene, he cuts himself "shaving," and is then shown following a blood trail (the Rose Line) to her resting place below an Egyptian-style pyramid at the Louvre. We then see him kneel exactly as knights do to signify his chivalric dedication to her name. Clearly Mary not Jesus is the way, the truth and the light.  <br>  <br>Previous attempts to expose the Templar conspiracy focus too heavily on a single female protagonist, Mary Magdalene, making no mention of a female _society_. This is the major oversight that needs correcting. The Order of Sion was not headed by _one_ mysterious matriarch from a illustrious dynasty. Not by a long chalk. As the Great Royal Wives controlled the Egyptian pharaohs, so in later times have the Female Illuminati directed the destiny of the world through their male deputies.|---|

The red cross, and similar symbols, also denotes the Alpha Lodges of Masonry, which I refer to as the Black Lodges. As disclosed in the following articles, these highly secretive organizations are directed by powerful figures and dynasties tracing their origins back to ancient Egypt.  
  
The Templaresque or Sionist Alpha Lodges are exclusive in the extreme. They don’t accept you and I or any common man. They are headed by extremely privileged individuals such as King Juan Carlos of Spain, Otto and Karl von Habsburg, Prince Michael Duke of Kent, Louis Mountbatten, Queen Beatrix of Holland, Prince Bernhardt, Queen Elizabeth of England, as well as those she appoints to her so-called Privy Council, Order of St. Michael and St. George and Knights of the Garter.  
  
Men from these illustrious pedigrees and lodges are related to the so-called Black Nobility. Descended from illustrious Setian-Atonists, they commission other important societies around the world, both secret and open, for the recruitment of loyal members whose job it is to interface with the "unwashed" masses. These recruits come from the Catholic world as much as from the Protestant, which should have alerted interested parties long ago. (This particular collusion is explained as we go...)  
  
The all-powerful Black Lodge members authorize various lower-level societies and councils to vet and select the many less-informed lieutenants who get to run the governments, institutes and think-tanks of countries throughout the world. These lower-level pawns are the common duplicitous politicians and functionaries we are all too familiar with. These "opposames" certainly do not serve you or I. Nowadays, because of the unceasing work of researchers such as myself, many intelligent people realize this fact.  
  
Indeed, the main reason why we tend to doubt the existence and power of secret societies is simply because we are not members of the club. It all goes on in the shadows and periphery of vision. You have to make a detailed lifelong study to uncover the roots of this pestilence. You must learn to endure the ridicule of almost everyone you attempt to awaken on these controversial matters. You must also be able to keep track of the seismic changes and dynastic rivalries that have occurred within the world of secret societies. Some of these feuds and purges are known to the public, while others have been kept secret for centuries.  

**.**  

The role of women in regards the world's most powerful secret societies is an area utterly neglected both by mainstream and alternative historians, and for good reason. The Female Illuminati (the Order of Sion) is second to none in authority, and their senior members have seen to it that knowledge of their existence does not leak out. Only now can the subject be sensibly explored.  
  
Most people are inclined to believe that women play no part whatsoever in Masonry or Templarism. As I show in my Female Illuminati program, nothing could be further from the truth. Not only did women birth, raise and marry male demagogues the world over - those who apparently established the network of infamous secret societies - but women were in many cases top members of these societies.

Yolande de Anjou (Duchess of Lorraine) 1428-1483,  
was matriarch of the secretive Order of Sion.  

Throughout these following articles I show that it is, without doubt, the Female Illuminati that controls and directs the Black Lodge and other lesser societies.  
  
As to the origin of the better known Order of the Illuminati, you can look to two interesting men to gain understanding. One is Ignatius Loyola of Spain and the other is Adam Weishaupt of Germany. Ignatius Loyola was the founder of the infamous Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuit Order. He was their first "General" or "Black Pope."  
  
Curiously, the Jesuit Order (the only Catholic order ever to be officially suppressed and penalized by the Papacy) was abolished in the year 1773. Pope Clement XIV finally, with some reluctance, issued a Papal Brief (order) completely abolishing the Jesuit Order, supposedly for all time. Now we ask, are we to accept it as a coincidence that the Illuminati (under Weishaupt) comes online, as it were, in the year 1776, a mere three years later? I think not.  
  
The Jesuits had been in trouble with several powerful monarchs in Europe and South America for over ten years before the ban was issued. So they were well and truly aware of what was in store for them and their nefarious order. Before the hammer came down in 1773, the Jesuits anticipated their dire predicament and fomented plans for a clandestine resurgence. In fact the Jesuits were already experienced at creating satellite orders throughout the world for their members to conceal themselves behind during times when local suppression occurred. So it was easy for them to resurface under a new guise when the situation demanded it. After their worldwide ban, their new organ of concealment, infiltration and destruction was in my opinion the Bavarian Illuminati.  
  
But what further proof do we have other than the coinciding dates?  
  
As to the name "Illuminati," it takes us straight to the door of Ignatius Loyola. As a young man in Spain he had been arrested and charged with membership and support of the notorious sect known as the Alumbrados, which may have originated in the 1490s, not long after the Templars went underground. _Just a coincidence, nothing to worry about!_  
  
In any case, Loyola found himself arrested, charged with heresy and imprisoned due to his affiliation with the sect. He lost his university position and was under strict surveillance for some time because of his open affiliation with the secretive illegal society. Suggestively, the Alumbrados were also known as "The Illuminati." The members referred to themselves as the Brothers of Light or Shining Ones. So do we take it as a coincidence that the later Bavarian Illuminists just happened to adopt this title from the selfsame order favored by the founder and _head of the Jesuits?_  
  
And if the Illuminati was created by the Jesuits, as one more satellite order, does this mean the Illuminati were a front for the Papacy, as one is taught to believe? This argument holds only if the Jesuits were loyal Papists, but falls to pieces if this is not the case. What if the head Jesuits secretly served some other power?  
  
The connection is complicated by the crafty rhetoric and propaganda released by the Illuminati and their agents, concocted to distance themselves from the Jesuits - and to give the impression they were anti-royalist. Despite this, it can't be doubted that Adam Weishaupt was himself a Jesuit, and in my opinion remained so until the end.  
  
He was certainly not anti-royalist because some of his closest compatriots, such as Baron von Knigge, were nobles related to illustrious dynasties such as Stuart, Hesse, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Hapsburg, Bourbon, Lorraine, and others. Moreover, Weishaupt languished in the homes of the nobility for the last forty years of his life, even receiving a lifelong pension from Ernest II, the Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, himself an Illuminati member.  
  
Apparently the Lutheran duke did not mind working alongside Catholic members, such as the Count de Mirabeau and Duke d'Orleans, etc. Another confederate and co-creator of the Bavarian Illuminati was Prince William of Hesse-Kassel, from the family which employed the Rothschilds as treasurers and investors. Prince William's brother Karl was both an elite Mason and Illuminist. These men were senior members of the Black Nobility ([Here](https://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-4.html) fore more...)  
  
The merger of the Illuminati and Masons occurred at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, in 1777, at a cozy retreat owned by Prince William:

||_The Weishaupt documents are incontestably authentic; the Bavarian government unwittingly forestalled any attempt to cry “Forgery” (in the manner made familiar in our century) by inviting any who were interested to inspect the original documents in the archives at Munich_ ­– Douglas Reed (_Controversy of Zion_)|

This was not the combination of rival societies, but of ones governed by men with a similar sinister agenda. It was an association that did not go unopposed.  
  
The Duke of Brunswick (Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand), himself a senior Mason, sounded a worldwide warning about the subversive agenda of the Templar-Jesuit-Illuminists. His address of 1794 informed the world as to the danger of the Illuminist infiltration of Masonry. During a speech, the duke warned: _A great sect arose, which taking for its motto the good and the happiness of man, worked in the darkness of the conspiracy to make the happiness of humanity a prey for itself. This sect is known to everyone; its brothers are known no less than its name._ He continued saying:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_They deluged the world with a multitude of publications; they recruited apprentices of every rank and in every position; they deluded the most perspicacious men by falsely alleging different intentions. They sowed in the hearts of youth the seed of covetousness, and they excited it with the bait of the most insatiable passions. Indomitable pride, thirst of power, such were the only motives of this sect:_ _their masters had nothing less in view than the thrones of the earth, and the government of the nations was to be directed by their nocturnal clubs_ - Duke of Brunswick (Manifesto of 1794)|

The duke referred to the infiltrators and corrupters as a "Sun Order." In my opinion, this intriguing reference describes and leads us to the door of the ancient Atonist Order of Zadok or Melchizedek, that is of Pharaoh Akhenaton and his ideological descendants, i.e., the Knights Templar, Strict Observance, Grand Orient, Jesuits, and other clandestine orders the world over.  
  
The remonstrations of the duke are not those of a humanitarian concerned with the fate of the world. His objections were simply prompted by fear of losing control of his masonic societies to other navigators determined to change direction. A great deal of world history is little more than the "pillow-fights" (dynastic conflicts) between bat-crazy royals. Too bad that millions of ordinary men and women have been used as cannon-fodder in these conflagrations.  
  
Weishaupt's Illuminati was partly financed by the Jewish Rothschild dynasty, but all is revealed when we remember that the Rothschilds were, and still are, Papal Knights. The Swiss branch of the Rothschilds, in particular, have long been loyal servants of the Black Nobility: the Hapsburg dynasty, College of Cardinals, and families that make up Italy's oligarchy. Members of the Rothschild family - and other _Hofjuden_ or Court Jews - have been awarded with high honors by those who now control the Papacy, namely the Knights of Malta, the modern version of the Knights Templar. This group take its orders from the elusive and superior Order of Sion or Sisterhood of Death.  
  
Indeed the Templars and Jesuits indulged in banking and tax-collecting _before_ Jews took it up. The Rothschilds began banking enterprises in the eighteenth century, whereas the Templars were involved in banking in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries. (See [Article II](https://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-2.html) for how Jews became entangled with the Black Lodge)

||_...the Templars became bankers to every throne in Europe. They lent money to hard-up monarchs at low interest rates and transferred money for merchant bankers. Through a system of promissory notes they allowed money deposited in one city to be drawn in another. They became money-changers and powerful capitalists who conducted diplomacy between monarchs. In England the Master of the Temple was soon given precedence over all other priors and abbots_ – Nicholas Hagger (_Secret History of the West_)  <br>  <br>_The Templars eventually became so rich that the monarchs of some of the kingdoms within which they operated were wholly dependent on their support. Several kings of England actually lodged the treasury of the realm at the Templar headquarters in London, as surety against the massive debts they ran up with the order. This gave the Templars great power to influence decision-making, and they regularly acted as arbiters for warring monarchs_ – Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe (_The Knights Templar Revealed_)  <br>  <br>_By the beginning of the thirteenth century the Templars had become the international bankers of Europe and were appointed treasurers to the French royal family and the Vatican_ – Michael Howard (_Occult Conspiracy_)|

The Rothschilds, for all their colossal power and wealth, were and are servants of the more secretive and illustrious Black Nobility. Many are descendants and agents of the infamous Babylonian Gaonim.  
  
This group - whose insignia appears within the masonic compass and rule - were made up of elite Pharisees and Sadducee who regrouped in Babylon after the devastation of Judea by the Romans in AD 70. Although nominally Jewish, the Gaonim reverted to goddess worship, reappearing in history under the title _Freemason_ - meaning Brothers of the Sun (Aton).  
  
As the years passed, the more liberal members of the Gaonim formed close ties with Nazarenes, Templars and Rosicrucians, not to mention the Jesuits and Illuminists. The Gaonim are _not_ to be confused with moral religious Jews. Once this is understood a lot of missing pieces of the puzzle fall into place.

They were largely based on the confession of Cagliostro who had been arrested by the Inquisition in 1789.

This obviously has the ring of truth. Jews as a tribe and tiny demographic have been in the world for millennia. They've craved their homeland Israel for almost as long, from the period of their alleged "Exiles" in Assyria and Babylon. long before the birth of Christ. If they were as powerful and wealthy as many believe, they'd have secured Israel for themselves long before 1948. Yet this they strangely found impossible for centuries until Western gentiles finally conspired and _gave_ Israel to them. These Western potentates and ministers achieved overnight what all the sultans of the Ottoman Empire, and kings of Russia, Spain, Portugal, Iran, Persia, Babylon, and elsewhere, never managed to do - what the richest Jews in the world were unable to achieve. What's wrong with this picture?

||The Sabbatean-Framkist-Illuminists not only included members of the infamous Rothschild family - agents of the Templar-Luciferians - but also Moses Mendelssohn, one of the five original members of the Bavarian Illuminati.  <br>  <br>The story of how "Jews" came to be involved with the Templars is explained in [Article III](https://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html).||

As to the Templar-Jesuit relationship, Loyola, Francis Xavier, and other early Jesuits wrote that they were intentionally organizing their fledgling society along the lines of the Knights Templar, the renegade once Catholic order suppressed by the Church in the fourteen century. So why would the situation have been different in the eighteenth century when the curtain was temporarily brought down on the Jesuits by higher authority? I do not think it was different. I think the Jesuits simply adopted the structure of their _parent_ order - the Templars. I also believe it was Templar agents within the Vatican who, during the reign of Pope Pius VII, worked to overturn Pope Clement's ban and restore the Jesuits legally to their original prominent station.  
  
What this tells us is that the Jesuits were certainly established by the wily Templars as a satellite order, just as at a later date the Jesuits formed the Illuminati for similar reasons. Posing as ardent Papists, the Jesuits remained secretly loyal to their secretive Templar masters who, through their chief agents (the Clerks or Clerics) subverted numerous organizations throughout Europe and the world. (The story of the Clerics is told in Article III.)

||Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556) and Adam Weishaupt (1748-1830). Both men were Jesuits and "Illuminists." Loyola and his order were obsessively dedicated to the Virgin Mary while the members of the Illuminati referred to themselves as "Minervals," after the goddess Minerva. One of Minerva's mascots was the owl, the bird that hunts at night and sees what is invisible to those who dwell in the light of day. Mary and Minerva are both "virginal" icons. This is a reference not to sex but to the female Dragon Court operating behind more conspicuous male orders. Minerva is a "rebel" goddess who assisted Prometheus to steal the heavenly fire. Her origin lies with the most ancient Egyptian goddess Neith, the "Red Queen." The red shield and arrows that appear on the Rothschild family crest allude to Neith, who was transmogrified into Pallas-Athena or Minerva. The single eye is also a prime goddess symbol. The Frankfurt branch of the Illuminati was entitled the "All Seeing Eye Lodge," once headed by the notorious Jacob Frank, head of the Setian-Luciferian order of Frankists. (Click [here](http://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/the-goddess-minerva.html) for more on Minerva, and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_of_the_Society_of_Jesus) for more on Pope Clement's ban of the Jesuits.)||

It is interesting and suggestive that both Loyola and Weishaupt were Jesuits. They may also have had Jewish ancestry. In any case, after becoming Masons in their younger days, they were later recruited and indoctrinated by Templar agents.

||_As never before since our alienation, this battle for freedom can now be fought by all Germans, and virtuously ended in the clear perception of our enemies: Jews, Freemasons, Jesuits and the Roman Pope_ - General Erich Ludendorff (_Destruction of Freemasonry_)  <br>  <br>_Not only does the fraternity (Freemasonry) owe its existence to Templarism, the fraternity seems to loudly proclaim it in a number of ways_ - Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe  <br>  <br>_I have shown from authentic documents that, from its introduction into France by monks until the advent of the reign of James I of England, British Masonry was purely Roman Catholic, and that its Grand Masters, of whom I have provided the official list, were drawn exclusively from the Court, the Nobility or the Prelacy…Despite the birth of the distinctive Masonry of William of Orange in 1694, the ancient British Masonry preserved its ancient statutes under the Protestant King and remained Roman Catholic: proof of this is to be found in the precious Masonic documents which I propose to publish, and which escaped the mad orgy of destruction at the hands of the innovators of modern Masonry in 1747_ – Brother Teder (_L’irregularite du Grand Orient de France,_ 1909)  <br>  <br>_It is claimed that before his execution the last Grand Master of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, assigned Hugo von Salm, a canon of Mainz, the mission of smuggling important Templar documents into Scotland.

Strict Observance Masonry incorporated references to the Templars into its rites and degrees_ – Glenn Magee (_Hegel & the Hermetic Tradition_)|

As your study continues you’ll find that there are many lies told about these men and their orgs. Adam Weishaupt's group is erroneously considered to have been anti-royalist. This assertion is blatantly false. Adam Weishaupt received additional support and funding from various nobles and royals, such as Baron von Knigge, and more significantly from Charles de Lorraine and the Duke de Orleans, that is by members of the Stuart, Hapsburg, Bourbon, Lorraine, Capet, and other more ancient and elusive Black Nobility dynasties. (See [Article IV](https://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-4.html)...)  
  
Some researchers believe it was Black Nobility member Charles de Lorraine (working under the pseudonym Kolmer) who divulged esoteric secrets to Weishaupt and commissioned him to establish the Illuminati. And the elusive Charles was no commoner. He was a true blue blood. So the idea that the Illuminati were _against_ monarchy is laughable. The only monarchs and nobles they were against were those not under their control and not members of their perfidious Brotherhood. Weishaupt's second in command, Baron von Knigge, was another blue-blood.  
  
Interestingly the highest grade attainable within the Illuminati bore the title REX meaning “King.” A strange title to bestow upon the highest initiate of a supposedly anti-royalist cabal, right?  
  
Of course, the king referred to is none other than Akhenaton, Lord of Light. Alternatively, as Ralph Ellis believes, it could also be King Izas, the Biblical Jesus, head of the Nazarene Sect, whose ancestors were Setian-Atonists. (See [Article IV](https://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-4.html) for more on this...)  
  
Let us never doubt that orders such as the Jesuits, Masons, Rosicrucians, Martinists and Illuminati, etc, are strictly hierarchical. This is because the seniors of these societies have no desire to impart their secrets to any applicant off the street. As Weishaupt himself stated:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The man who is good for nothing better remains a Scottish Knight. If he is, however, a particularly industrious coordinator, observer, worker, he becomes a Priest...If there are among these (Priests) high speculative intellects, they become Magi. These collect and put in order the higher philosophical system and work at the People’s Religion, which the Order will next give to the world. Should these high geniuses also be able to rule the world, they will become regents_|

Yes, Weishaupt's own words clue us in to the truth of the matter. It is a matter of "ruling" the world, not "helping" the world. Nice of him to be so explicit.  
  
But the fact that a senior Illuminist is awarded the title of "Regent" is also alarming, until one understands what it's all about.  
  
Actually, the Templar-Illuminist brass merely adopted an anti-royalist stance because it was an expedient ruse. It got them where they wanted to go. Societies of this kind are very chameleon-like. They know their enemies and how to subvert them. They know how to lure and win favor. They know how to create and sustain _faux rival groups_ to prevent authentic rival groups from moving against them. This tactic has served the powers-that-be no end. The propaganda they dished out in the eighteenth century was cunningly designed to attract rebellious young men of wealth and intelligence from all over the world. After all, you don’t want your secret society full of idiots.  
  
The idea was to attract such men in order to prevent them joining authentic opposition movements sprouting up throughout Europe and the Middle East. In order to seduce the young idealistic freedom-loving sons of wealthy royals and nobles, the Illuminati cunningly professed to be politically progressive and morally libertine. New recruits inevitably fell under the control of their puppeteers. Susceptible types were successfully indoctrinated, whereas overly suspicious radicals who sensed they were being duped were professionally or even physically assassinated.  
  
After generations of Machiavellian scheming, Illuminati agents ensconced themselves in every religious, political and corporate organization and institution, intent on changing the direction of world events to suit their sinister agendas. Although warnings went out from the highest in the land, it is only in relatively recent times that humanity has been made aware of these machinations. Apparently, there's still a ways to go before we can successfully subvert these blood-soaked crime-lords and architects of control.  
  
As for their liberalism, it served as the perfect cover for their agents entering the political arena. It assisted these agents to coax the governments and populace of the world toward the creation of multinational organizations such as the United Nations and European Union, etc. Indeed, one could say that their political outlooks and agendas are the key to their existence and industry. (More on this in [Article IV](https://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-4.html)...)  
  
In any case, regardless of the Templar-Jesuit-Illuminati connection, it is not right to think that the perfidious Order of the Illuminati began in the 1700s. Nor is it correct to think of masonry starting in the 17th and 18th centuries. As we said, the Alumbrados date from the fifteenth century, and there are other orders that preceded them, such as the Templars, Hospitallers and Rosicrucians, etc. Churches and monuments in France dating to the 5th century display masonic emblems, and scholars have found masonic symbols in the artwork and architecture of ancient Egypt. masonic-style aprons were certainly worn by early pharaohs and Phoenicians. Templar-like crosses can be seen on the regalia of Sumerian and Babylonian dignitaries. Moreover, there are many eminent masonic writers who have emphasized their society's antiquity. More importantly, the multifaceted _symbolism_ employed by these societies - the coffin, triangle, pyramid, pentagram, hexagram, twin pillars, checked floor, compass, letter G, etc - is undoubtedly ancient. This idiosyncratic symbolism conceals the "mysteries" to be uncovered and understood, mysteries leading back to ancient Egypt and beyond.

|---|[Article 8](https://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-8.html)The coffin is one of the most conspicuous masonic symbols, known to masons the world over. It actually refers to events that may have occurred millennia before the Christian era, or at least date to the AD 70 fall of the second Temple of Solomon in Judea. It's much the same story when it comes to most masonic iconography. (Here for more...)|---|

It is also important to realize that the Illuminati is not an exclusively Western phenomenon. Some researchers believe the Templars were heavily influenced by Middle-Eastern and oriental occult societies and traditions, so much so that they willingly, if secretly, renounced Christianity. According to some sources this accounts for why their parent order, the Order of Sion, excommunicated the Templars in the year 1188. It is perhaps also the reason why the Templars were officially suppressed in 1314 by the reigning Pope and King of France. (See [Article IV](https://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-4.html) for more on the rivalry.)  
  
The Eastern Illuminati include societies such as the Druze, Ishmalis, Assassins, Sabbateans, Frankists and Seveners, themselves branches of the super-secret Setian-Atonist Black Lodge that goes back to ancient Egypt. Although the Sabbateans and Seveners (like later Frankists) were officially founded by Jewish and Jewish occultists, their true origins lie in ancient times with the elusive Gaonim (Order of Melchizedek) mentioned earlier. Significantly, the Gaonim - themselves high-degree Setian-Atonists - referred to themselves as Exilarchs or Princes of Light.  
  
The famous letter "G" seen on masonic emblems (and several corporate logos) signifies not only this illustrious cadre, but the even more elusive and peculiar quorum they serve, those I refer to as the Serpent Sisterhood or _Female Illuminati_. (The lower case "g" signifies the serpent or dragon.) The emanating light often seen around the G is not the light of the sun, but of the planet Venus, sacred to the Sisterhood and known in esoteric circles as the Shekinah.

||There must be something not only secretive but prestigious about masonry and its kindred societies for men of eminence and intelligence to want to join and participate. The Gaonate were made up of elite Pharisees and Sadducees who went underground after the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. These elites were already part of the Egyptian Order of Melchizedek (Akhenaton) that had many devotees and agents in Judea, Palestine and Rome. Although ordinary orthodox Jews worship Jehovah, the male god, the higher echelons within or behind Judaism (the Gaonim, Sabbateans, Frankists, etc) worship the Goddess Asherah (Venus, Lucifer), also known as the Shekinah. The checkerboard on which Washington stands represents the two phases of the planet Venus - the rising and setting, or morning and evening phases. Note also the crescent and comet above Washington's head, representing Set. The reason for these celestial motifs is explained in the program. ([Here](https://unslaved.com/female-illuminati-program/) for more...)  <br>  <br>Note George Washington's lambskin apron or _abnet_. Aprons are _female_ symbols, originally worn in Egypt by semi-naked pubescent girls in order to conceal their genitalia during periods of menstruation. Masons wear them to symbolically _feminize_ themselves and present themselves as ritually (and maybe even physically) castrated eunuchs in service to their Goddess. Masonic aprons are loaded with female symbolism, as I show in the program. There can be little doubt that Weishaupt, Loyola, and men of their abnormal kind, were desexed eunuchs expertly hiding their pathological tendencies behind the veneer of patriarchal edifices such as the Catholic Church and Templars; the Templars themselves being ardent disciples of the Dragon Sisterhood. The genital "wounding" also serves as a ritual imitation of the wound of Lucifer who fell into the depths of the underworld, deprived of his virility and authority.||

Agents of the Black Lodge direct the operations of other functioning secret societies throughout the world, such as the Knights of Malta, Grand Orient, Opus Dei, Knights of Columbus, Order of Christ, Order of the Holy Sepulchre, Order of the Thistle, Order of St. Patrick, United Irishmen, Ancient Order of Hibernians, and so on. They also control ostensibly Protestant societies such as the Rosicrucians, Order of St. John, Orange Lodge and Black Perceptory, etc. This becomes obvious after one studies the _symbolism_ and political orientation of these societies.  
  
But what are we told when we ask about the origin of the little known illustrious society - the Gaonim? Well, ordinary religious Jews are wont to repeat the fallacies they've swallowed. They tell us they probably originated after the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 AD and split between Pharisees and Sadducees. They sometimes say they originated when Moses transmitted the secret Oral Law or Torah to the 70 elders of Israel on Mount Sinai; or that they were founded after the Israelites were released from their captivity in Babylon, or from the time of the secretive thirteenth tribe of Levites.  
  
This is true to a point, as long as we realize that the Levites themselves have an ancestry that goes even further back to the time of Akhenaton (known in occult circles as Moses, Aaron and Melchizedek), and the powerful Hyksos nobility that mainstream historians are reluctant to coherently comment on. This is chiefly because they know what ordinary folks are never meant to know - that the Hyksos nobility (and Levites) were originally high-born Scythians from Ireland, England and Scandinavia. Yes, many are the false leads and dead ends. It takes many years of arduous study to see behind the carefully crafted tall tales and smoke screens.  
  
Eventually, with the assistance of the Hyksos-Atonist descended Merovingian kings and Knights Templar, the Gaonim (or Order of Melchizedek) moved West and resurfaced under the title "Freemason." Under a Jewish veneer, lodges such as the infamous Lodge Theodore were formed to preserve the Gaonim's hoary traditions and allow "brothers" to meet and plot in secrecy.  
  
This explains why so many masonic tropes and ritual leitmotifs appear to be "Jewish" in origin. Exoteric researchers falsely believe this is all there is to the symbolism of masonry. It's what they are _meant_ to believe. In fact the origin of masonic symbolism far predates the rise of Judaism in all its configurations and permutations. As I show, esoteric Judaism, like masonry, is nothing less than corrupted Irish Druidism in the form of Egyptian Atonism - the Jewish Jehovah being none other than Aton, Lord of Light. (For more on this great story visit my [Irish Origins of Civilization](http://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/) website).  
  
In Article IV I fill in the background and explain who the Gaonim serve, and that they are, like the Masons, a branch of the very real and active _female_ Dragon Court.

**.**  

The reason for the many lies told about masonry’s origins is explained in my Female Illuminati program. I reveal what masonic symbolism really signifies, and who rules and directs from the _highest_ echelons.  
  
Controversially, I show that masonry is not the predominately male institution we've been led to believe. On the contrary, masonry's male-dominated parent orders were originally founded and controlled by an enclave of supremely powerful _females_ whose existence has been kept secret for centuries. It is the existence and history of this medusan Serpentine Sisterhood (or Dragon Court) which intrigues me personally. I believe this group’s history is traceable not only to ancient Syria, Parthia and Egypt, but to the _prediluvian_ world – to Atlantis.  

These shadowy cabals are predators of a kind. They can be countered and even destroyed once we are in possession of the facts about the true nature of evil. Sadly most of us are woefully ignorant about the workings of evil, especially that emanating from higher up the socioeconomic power-pyramid. In our affluent modern age we are extremely backward in subjects of this kind.  
  
We may care deeply about the state of decay, and plight of our brothers and sisters in the world. Okay, but what good is all our humanitarianism if we fail to understand the predatory tiger in the long grass working to subvert our good work? What do we know about its origin, habits and intent? It knows a great deal about us, which is why until now it has been winning the GREAT GAME. This situation must change, and soon!  
  
The Female Illuminati program is the result of the painstaking effort of decades. It is a slow piecing together of a controversial world picture in which we are all involved. Like an archaeologist at a dig, you don’t know what the final old parchment or vase will look like. You gradually piece it together until it’s finally assembled, and then stand back to see what it has to tell you about the world of the past. This is what I've done over the years, and it's been a very worthwhile commitment.  
  
It’s a great study because it exposes the sick crime-families that have plagued our world for so long, and counteracts the age-old WAR ON CONSCIOUSNESS which must be brought to an end, come what may.
