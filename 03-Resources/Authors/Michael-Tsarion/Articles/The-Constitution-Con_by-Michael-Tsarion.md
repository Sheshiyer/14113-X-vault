| _The first function of the founders of nations, after the founding itself, is to devise a set of true falsehoods about origins - a mythology - that will make it desirable for nationals to continue to live under common authority, and, indeed, make it impossible for them to entertain contrary thoughts_ - Forrest McDonald (_E Pluribus Unum_) |

The US Constitution was created on September 17, 1787, and ratified behind closed doors on June 21, 1788. Thirty nine of the fifty five delegates attending the Philadelphia Convention signed the document. Their con job is evident from the very first line penned. Legally, the "People" mentioned are not sovereign beings, but _willing_ slaves who have been granted the _illusion_ of freedom.  
  
From an occult point of view the Constitution was ratified on an _Atonist_ festival day. It is, therefore, a patently Solar Cult document.  
  
This is because the date of ratification - June 21st - is the day the sun ascends to its highest point in the zodiac.

| _Washington presided on a low rostrum in the Assembly Hall (where the Declaration of Independence had been approved) from his “rising sun chair.” The top of the chair showed half a sun with two eyes and a nose and thirteen rays like hair. Above it on a stem hung a pyramid-shaped plant. The whole is a Templar image. As the delegates sign the new Constitution, Benjamin Franklin told them that the sun on_ _Washington’s chair was rising, not setting on the new union_ - Nicholas Hagger (_Secret History of the West_) |

Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were three of the men who framed the infernal Constitution and pushed for its ratification. Their document served the American aristocracy, not the people. In fact the document was never put before the people for ratification, and was openly opposed by the majority of men and women in the original thirteen states, who resisted coming together to form any kind of unified nation. Facts of this sort have been deliberately concealed through the decades, but are now openly accepted by some mainstream American historians, such as Joseph Ellis, Thomas DiLorenzo, and others.  
  
The Constitutionalists were guileful traitors whose attendance at the Philadelphia Convention was kept secret for an entire generation. Their document served to leave the "door" of America unlocked and ajar, so the country's foreign enemies could surreptitiously re-enter in the days and years following the supposed War of Independence.

Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton - architects of monarchy in disguise  

The hypocrisy and duplicity of the Federalists is responsible for modern neo-imperialism and advent of the so-called New World Order. In our opinion these men were little more than British agents, because King George himself - who declared _eternal_ war on America - could not have done as much damage to America as their actions wrought.

||_Such a tyrannical future where property rights would be ignored, where a massive standing army would lurk unchallengeable, where Congressmen would hold office for life, where ruinous treaties would be commonplace, where Presidential powers would make Nero jealous, where gold and silver would vanish from circulation to be replaced by the worthless "notes" of a private banking conglomeration, where the States would be reduced to mere administrative departments of the feds, and where the grasp of taxation would actually reach into the common laborer's paycheck - all this was too fantastic to be even theoretically contemplated during the ratification debates_ - Kenneth W. Royce (_Hologram of Liberty_)|

When the duplicitous Hamilton was asked why he helped draft the Constitution, he guardedly replied:  

       _My motives must remain in the depository of my own breast._  

He was but one member of the Philadelphia Convention who secretly resented the independence of America. It is likely that he was directed and backed by British oligarchs who secretly knew how much wealth, through expansion, natural resources and taxation was available with the opening of America to settlers.  
  
One perceptive dissenter realized this and wrote:

| _The Continental convention...was composed of some men of excellent characters; of others who were more remarkable for their ambition and cunning, than their patriotism; and of some who have been opponents to the independence of the United States -_ (Dissenting Address of the Pennsylvanian Convention, 18 December 1787) |

The question of Hamilton's allegiances and motives remains open, although there is much to counter the idea that he was a true American patriot:  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| _Despite strong opposition, Hamilton succeeded in convincing his opponents, primarily Jefferson, that the federal federal government had to assume all debts, not only those incurred in waging the war, but also those contracted by each of the thirteen colonies...Now, America was able to freely borrow money from other nations_ - Charles Konia (_Neither Left Nor Right_)  <br>  <br>_Another major component of Hamilton’s program was the creation of a central bank, modeled after the Bank of England. The bank acted as a depository for government funds. It was a source of loans to the government and to other banks, and it regulated the money supply_ - ibid  <br>  <br>_A third consequence of creating a responsibly managed national debt was that it succeeded in harnessing the American people’s latent working power_ - ibid |

In _Hamilton's Curse_, Thomas J. Dilorenzo says of Hamilton:

| _...he wanted a highly centralized government.

As treasury secretary, he was a frenetic tax-increaser and advocated government planning of the economy. He championed the accumulation accumulation of public debt, protectionist tariffs, and politically controlled banks; belittled politicians like Jefferson who spoke too much of liberty; and believed that the new American government should pursue the course of national and imperial glory, just like the British, French, and Spanish and British Empires_. T_homas Jefferson held the exact opposite position on every one of these issues._ |

Harnessing available manpower and resources all sounds mighty good and laudable on the surface. But who was and is the chief beneficiary of the labor of Americans? Is it the ordinary man in the street? I think not.  
  
Hamilton was a member of the traitorous Society of the Cincinnati, named after the Roman dictator. This elitist order included George Washington as head and Major General Henry Knox as secretary. Both men were card-carrying Freemasons and Federalists. They and their cohorts planned to subvert and destroy the American Republic, replacing it with an oligarchy.

| _...this Constitution was a strange occurrence. Before that time, there was no such thing as a nation being ruled by a constitution. Countries were ruled by kings who granted some rights to the people. Yet governance by constitution had existed in Masonic lodges for hundreds of years_ - Sanford Holst (_Sworn in Secret: Freemasonry and the Knights Templar_) |

James Madison is considered the "father" of the US Constitution. He was heavily influenced, as were many American politicians, by the philosophy of French aristocrat Baron de Montesquieu who believed in monarchy. Madison was also influenced by the writings of British empiricist philosopher John Locke, himself "a major investor in the English slave trade through the Royal Africa Company." Madison was vehemently opposed to state independence and pushed the Constitution to keep power out of the hands of ordinary Americans. He openly advocated an anti-Republican ideology and commented on how illiterate masses should be divided and controlled:  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| _Where a majority are united by a common sentiment, and have an opportunity, the rights of the minor party become insecure. In a republican government the majority, if united, have always an opportunity. The only remedy is to enlarge the sphere and thereby divide the community into so great a number of interests and parties that, in the first place, a majority will not be likely, at the same moment, to have a common interest separate from that of the whole, or of the minority; and, in the second place, that, in case they should have such an interest, they may not be so apt to unite in the pursuit of it_ - (_Elliot's Debates_, Vol. 5) |

Madison was the only delegate to keep records of proceedings at the Convention. However, his notes were not made public until four years _after_ his death. Prior to their public release the notes had been thoroughly edited.  
  
The con is evident from the Constitution's Preamble, as we said. In fact the "People" referred to are _not_ citizens of America, No! They are the elites who rule from within a legally separate precinct known as the District of Columbia. This district is under federal control and the government operating from within it is, legally speaking, a _foreign_ institution. The term "We the People"  denotes this separate ruling elite. It refers to the imperious overlords who have _granted_ the Constitution to the masses within the "United States of America" - the _non-sovereign_ nation under _their_ control. Therefore, the entity mentioned in the first line of the Preamble is _not_ the same entity mentioned in the last line. Let's read it again and uncover the cunning artifice of its authors:  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| _We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America._ |

This is what the Preamble subtextually infers:  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| _WE THE RULING ARISTOCRACY, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution FOR THE SLAVES WITHOUT RIGHTS, UNDER OUR FEDERAL CONTROL._  <br>  <br>_Because "People" is capitalized it is a proper noun referring to a specific body of people_ _-_ Kenneth W. Royce |

These facts explain why the word "for" is found in the last line, not the word "of." Legally, there is a big difference between:  

        _...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America._  

and:  

         _...do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States of America._  

The first rendering implies the Constitution has been _granted_ to one body by another. Ergo the Constitution is nothing more than a totalitarian document, ratifying aristocratic control over the "United States of America" and its inhabitants. The elites are literally saying: "This document and its articles are _for_ you." The point being that it is not _of_ you, meaning, it is not organically and intrinsically _yours_ by natural or divine right. The word "for" indicates that the matter of the document is _bestowed_ and imposed by others. And of course when a person gives someone something, they presumably want something in return. This was certainly the case for the cunning Federalists who conceived the Constitution.  
  
The Constitution was not drawn up to award people rights of any kind, but to take them away. It's a case of parchment idolatry, mass hypnosis, mass intoxication and colossal ignorance about the architecture of control. By willingly reaching for the glowing prize of freedom Americans found themselves wearing chains of perpetual enslavement.  
  
Suggestively, the word "of" does appear in a meaningful legal declaration. It appears in the text of the Presidential Oath:  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _I solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States._ |

In this instance, the word "of" designates the President as a member of the aristocratic elite - denoted by the words "United States." He is, therefore, a ruler __separate__ from the citizens in the various states. The "for" does not apply to the President because, unlike the masses, he is not an outsider. He is part of the inner sovereign cadre referenced by the word "of." The Constitution is "of" the ruling elite, but is "for" the masses. In effect the Constitution is a schizophrenic document. There are _two_ Constitutions; one for the serving masses, and one for the served oligarchs ruling from within the legally sacrosanct District of Columbia. This is why the Preamble contains two _different_ terms: the "United States" (denoting the oligarchy and their authority), and "United States of America" (denoting the non-sovereign masses on the receiving end).  
  
If the Presidential Oath read as follows, there would be less cause for concern:  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States of America, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America._ |

Then again, pigs might fly. Alarmingly, before it was dropped, the President's original title was "His Excellency."  
  
Many critics and authors have pointed out these disturbing facts and rightly insist that the so-called "United States" is not the same thing as the so-called "United States of America." Nevertheless, due to deliberate misinformation and conditioning, most people do believe the terms refer to one and the same entity. They are certainly not inclined to think of the "United States" (or U.S.) as a foreign _corporation_. Furthermore, the drafters of the Constitution intentionally saw to it that the term "United States" had more than one meaning. Specifically, they knew the term did not refer to citizens of a state. Once-upon-a-time an American could have been a citizen of a state without being a citizen of the nation. This political idiosyncrasy did not suit the Federalists who ingeniously manipulated the words and terms we are familiar with. It is a old trick that serves the cause of totalitarians everywhere.

| _...not only were the poly meanings of "United States" intentionally and expressly used within the Constitution, but often in ways as to actually invite confusion. For such brilliant men to explain three jurisdictional concepts would, on its face, pose a great mystery_ _-_ Kenneth W. Royce |

When members of the police or military swear to serve, uphold and protect the Constitution and "United States," they probably imagine their oath is sworn to the American people. Nothing could be further from the truth. They are in fact swearing to give their labor, and possibly their lives, for the diabolical corporate executives of Washington D.C.

 Oaths of allegiance are fine, as long as you know to whom or to what you're swearing to.  

In short, the U.S. and the U.S.A., are not the same entity. The alleged "People" are not, therefore, free and sovereign members of a country, as they would have been under the Articles of Confederation drawn up after the War of Independence. No, they were and still are merely employees of a privately run corporation. They do not have rights, they have provisionally granted privileges. They have liberty, but do not have permanent and inviolable sovereignty or freedom.

Because of the Constitution, the populace have been intentionally stripped of their sovereign rights. It is also because of this particular chicanery that Americans presently find themselves politically and economically undermined. The Federalist plan was nothing less than an act of war. It was the plan of agent provocateurs and fifth columnists. Only a very few authors have stated this in so many words. However, we are convinced that the early Federalists were ministers of the Crown.

Their boss, King George, did not resend his physical army to attack with force of arms.

| _The phrase "direct and immediate allegiance" is something right out of feudal law...Americans who became "U.S. citizens" have transposed themselves from one system into another fundamentally different from the first...Americans have unknowingly joined a modern feudal system in which they must render a percentage of their toil to their federal master_ _-_ Kenneth W. Royce  <br>  <br>_The non-federal state Citizenship became virtually unknown as millions of state Americans were tricked out of their sovereignty and into federal citizenship - and thus into federal jurisdiction. Today, the states have been all but replaced by corporate, federal overlays...There's probably not enough left of the original states for Americans to resume state Citizenship_ - ibid |

These facts show that the Constitution was not a progressive document. On the contrary, its cunning drafters concocted it knowing that it would help to usher in the kind of Merchant State system that flourished earlier in America, before the War of Independence, and shortly after the first settlers arrived, with their _British_ systems of law. As Albert Jay Nock explains:  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| _The fundamental fact to be observed in any survey of the American State's initial development is the one whose importance was first remarked, I believe, by Mr. Beard; that the trading-company - the commercial corporation for colonization - was actually an autonomous State. "Like the State," says Mr. Beard, "it had a constitution, a charter issued by the Crown...it had a territorial basis, a grant of land often greater in area than a score of European principalities...every essential element long afterward found in the government of the American State appeared in the chartered corporation that started English civilization in America"_ - (_Our Enemy: the State_) |

Nock goes on to emphasize the connections between the "Old World" system of control and so-called "New World" system:  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _...the system of civil order established in America was the State-system of the "mother countries"...the only thing that distinguished it was that the exploited and dependent class was situated at an unusual distance from the owning and exploiting class. The headquarters of the autonomous State were on one side of the Atlantic, and its subjects on the other._ |

The elites of Britain and Europe knew that remote control was only feasible for a short time. They knew they had to have their agents on site in order for the engines of exploitation to work efficiently. Consequently, in 1628, during the reign of Charles I, the oligarchs established the Massachusetts Bay Company in America. Many of the Constitution's most illustrious signers became wealthy from their memberships of corporations such as the Massachusetts Bay Company which overflowed with agents of the British Crown. Business the American way is, it seems, business the _British_ way.

| _While it is not surprising that America's Founding Fathers were mostly slave owners, a legal activity, it may be surprising to discover that they were often smugglers as well. Profits from drug running, smuggling, slave trading, and even piracy are directly responsible for the founding of several of the country's most important banks, which are still in operation today. New England's staunch insurance business was born and prospered through profits earned from insuring opium and slave ships. The large railroad system that was built throughout the continental United States in the nineteenth century was funded with profits from illegal drug smuggling. And one of the greatest opium fortunes would provide seed money for the telephone and communications industry_ - Steven Sora (_Secret Societies of America's Elite_) |

Left: The flag of the British East India Company. Right: The Flag of the "United States"  
Corporation. Red, White and Blue are known as the Colors of the King. Does this  
mean that the "States" are in fact "Estates" of the Crown?

Of course there were clever men who knew what was going on. Even before the Constitution - the document of servitude - was signed and ratified, the warnings went out:

| _That investigation into the nature and construction of the new constitution, which the conspirators have so long and zealously struggled against, has, notwithstanding their partial success, so far taken place as to ascertain the enormity of their criminality. That system which was pompously displayed as the perfection of government, proves upon examination to be the most odious system of tyranny that was ever projected, a many headed hydra of despotism, whose complicated and various evils would be infinitely more oppressive and afflictive than the scourge of any tyrant_ - "Centinel" (Essay 12, 23 January 1788) |

Today these men would be referred to as Globalists or Internationalists.|The anonymous author of this diatribe would not be in the least surprised to see the present state of decay, and neither would Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson or Andrew Jackson. They would simply realize that their worst fears were justified.  <br>  <br>As we said, the rise of imperialism in America is the result of the "door" being deliberately left ajar, so to speak. The enemies of America were able to creep in whenever they chose. And creep in they did, confident the country would eventually fall into their unworthy hands. They knew their agents were ensconced within the country to misuse their positions of authority within government and big business to gradually undermine the Articles of Confederation that guaranteed each and every American the rights they deserved. They knew they simply had to continue employing the "divide and rule" tactic to further globalist interests.  <br>  <br>During his reign King George III adamantly proclaimed his utter hatred for the American rebels and American experiment.|

He openly declared "eternal" war on America, and his word was law to his many loyal and industrious lieutenants. True to form, agents of the British Crown have been waging eternal war on the country ever since the day of their lunatic master.﻿﻿  
The men who undermined the Articles of the Confederation and hustled the Constitution have had statues and portraits raised in their honor. Volumes have been written about their deeds, but rarely has the truth been told, except in alternative circles. Throughout America and the world the traitors are lauded as great revolutionaries, reformers and humanitarians. Their ideological descendants openly and unashamedly work hand in hand with British and European oligarchs, using fear and panic to further their agendas. They continue to erode whatever is left of the privileges once bestowed upon their slaves.

||_We have "federal sheriffs" beyond imagination. There are forty six civilian agencies of the Federal Government whose agents carry guns and have the power to make arrests. These "great insults on the people" have been allowed because there is little we can do about them, short of armed rebellion. And by the way, no laws authorizing "civil forfeiture" or other related measures of tyranny have been struck down by the federal courts -_ Kenneth W. Royce  <br>  <br>_We have plenty of rights in this country, provided you don't get caught exercising them_ - Terry Mitchell (Editor of _The Revolutionary Toker_)|

Patrick Henry was one patriot who understood what was going on. He did not attend the Convention in Philadelphia, and said: "I smell a rat." He was dead right. But there was more than one stinking _human_ rat loose at the Convention. The traitors referred to themselves as "Federalists" because they knew the people would think of them as servants of America. And they were right. Their smokescreen worked wonderfully. Today the misuse of words and terms continues. George Bush's "Patriot Acts" dupe the uninformed masses and give them the impression it is patriotic to give up hard won rights in turn for government protection.

||_For centuries, pillage by invading armies was a normal part of warfare…Nowadays, at least in more civilized countries, we do not let armies rampage for booty. We leave the pillaging to men in suits, and we don’t call it pillaging anymore. We call it economic development_ - Brian Whitaker (_The Guardian_)|

So much for Corporate Socialism, the replacement for genuine Capitalism. Too bad the majority of Americans cannot tell a super-rich Socialist from a bone fide hard-working patriotic Capitalist. _Thanks Media!_  
  
The Bushes did as their predecessors had done two hundred years ago. The Federalist traitors hurried the ratification process along and gave the Convention delegates and American people little time to scrutinize the Constitution's articles. George W. Bush did likewise when it came to his Patriot Acts. No foregin terrorist ever had to worry about them. They weren't the victims of increased draconian control. It was the average Joe's whose life was to become even more restricted. Bush also saw to it that the investigations into the causes of the September Eleventh tragedy were hampered and limited:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_President Bush personally asked Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle…to limit the Congressional investigation into the events of September 11, Congressional and White House sources told CNN…The request was made at a private meeting with Congressional leaders_ - Gore Vidal (_Dreaming War_)|

His business connections with Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries and interests ensured that the truth about the infamous incident would never reach the public.  
  
George W. Bush's lack of regard for the Constitution is not unique. As a Globalist he does not serve America or the interests of American people. He is one of many men who have used the Constitution as a stepping stone toward what might be described as an world super state. Nowadays the conspirators who labor toward this utopian wet-dream appear to be less inclined to conceal the reasons for their intrigue. As George W. Bush himself put it:

Author Forrest MacDonald clarified the issue concerning the undermining of the Articles of Confederation. In his book entitled _Alexander Hamilton: A Biography_, he wrote:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_What did determine the outcome were the rules of the contest, which Hamilton played an important part in formulating. The convention decided to disregard the amendment procedures prescribed in the Articles of Confederation and instead provided that each state should hold a special election for delegates to a ratifying convention...Had the rules of the Articles of Confederation been adhered to, the Constitution would never have been adopted._|

The dissenters knew what lay in store and were worried. Their warnings went largely unheard and the ratification of the Constitution hurriedly commenced regardless of the warnings of perceptive critics:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_It is insisted, indeed, that this constitution must be received, be it ever so imperfect. But remember, when the people once part with power, they can seldom or never resume it again by by force.

No sooner was the Constitution ratified than the oligarchs began acting tyrannically toward the American people. British agent President George Washington - who presided over the signing of the Constitution and who was a member of the Ohio Company of Virginia, the Mississippi Company, and the Potomac Company - sent thirteen thousand armed troops to violently stamp out the so-called Whiskey Rebellion of 1794. This rebellion was against heavy taxation.  
  
The victims of government oppression soon discovered they could not use the Constitution to receive justice. It contained little provision for the underclasses. It gave complete suzerainty to the courts and judges, not to the people or states. To all intents and purposes it was as if the War of Independence had never been fought.  
  
The Constitution merely made it possible for agents of the British Crown to operate as if they served the citizens of America. In this regard, nothing has changed.

||_The facts about the American Revolution show that in the early days, in the mid 1770's, the colonialists suffered a series of defeats. Strategic secrets were being passed to the British. The facts also show that an American army general, Benedict Arnold, was a traitor who plotted to surrender the fort at West Point to the British and turn the tide of war against his own side. The facts link Washington with Arnold when it comes to Freemasonry and the facts show that the day the plot was discovered, Washington was due to meet Arnold at West Point...Washington has been working with Arnold and passing secrets to the British_ - Robert Cooper (Interview on Dan Brown's _The Lost Symbol_)|

The tyranny continued in 1798 with the Alien and Sedition Acts. These Acts made criticism of federal officials a punishable offense. The Constitution served to strengthen the powers of the wealthy aristocratic class in America. It possessed few benefits for the average citizen and ultimately legalized widespread acts of confiscation and extortion. As Thomas Jefferson once remarked: "The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground." The point is emphasized by Constitutional scholar and author Kenneth W. Royce:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_If analyzed in contrast to history since 1787, it appears that the Constitution was purposely laden with several components designed to nearly guarantee the gradual expansion of the Federal Government - at the expense of the States and the people -_ (_Hologram of Liberty_)|

The Founding Fathers may have referred to themselves as Federalists. But this was, as we said, yet one more cunning play on words. Master propagandists such as Vladimir Lenin probably learned tactics from America's faux Federalists.

Along with Samuel Adams and Thomas Paine, he is remembered as one of the most influential and radical advocates of the American Revolution and of Republicanism, especially in his denunciations of corruption of government officials - (Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia)|The _original_ Federalists demanded a government of limited powers and were for State power. Their needs were ably met by the Articles of Confederation ratified in 1781. After the War of Independence (1775 to 1783), Americans had the Constitution forced upon them. Ever since then Americans have been duped about the prestige of the document. The people and representatives of the original thirteen states were not allowed enough time to decide whether the document was sound or not. Patrick Henry questioned the haste and warned of the consequences of accepting the Constitution without due consideration and debate. He knew that State representatives needed at least a year to mull over the articles of the Constitution. He spoke out and said:  <br><br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|_Why then tell us of dangers to terrify us into an adoption of this new Government? And yet who knows the dangers that this new system may produce; they are out of sight of the common people: They cannot foresee latent consequences: I dread the operation of it on the middling and lower class of people: It is for them I fear the adoption of this system...I see jeopardy in this new Government. I see none from our present one._\||

As we said, the Constitution's articles scandalously allowed the Supreme Court to possess almost unlimited legal powers:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_No country has given its courts such extraordinary power. Not Britain, where an act of Parliament binds the courts. Not India...Not even West Germany or Ireland, where the power of judicial review is established but exercised on a narrower scale. The President is elected. State legislators and Governors are elected. Supreme Court Justices are not elected: they are appointed for life_ - Archibald Cox (_The Court and the Constitution_)|

Despite widespread resistance and a spirit of animosity toward the Constitution's articles, its cheerleaders Madison, Hamilton, Franklin and Washington relentlessly pressed on. They ensured that resistance to their will was summarily suppressed.   

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Most troublesome to the framers of the Constitution was the increasing insurgent spirit evidenced among the people. Fearing the popular takeover of state governments, the wealthy class looked to a national government as a means of protecting their interests. Even in states where they were inclined to avoid strong federation, the rich, once faced with the threat of popular rule and realizing that a political alliance with conservatives from other states would be a safeguard if the radicals could capture the state government...gave up 'state rights' for 'nationalism' without hesitation -_ Michael Parenti (_Democracy for the Few_)  <br>  <br>_Within a month after the 17 September signing, a torrent of anti-constitution essays appeared in the newspapers, pleasing for prudent wisdom. This horrified three particular federalists, who quickly went on the editorial offensive in what was to be a staggering 85 essays totaling some 175,000 words. The Federalist Papers were written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to defend the proposed Constitution...Hamilton, Madison, and Jay hid for years behind the pseudonym "Publius"...to conceal from the public their true identities, and Convention attendance_ - Kenneth W. Royce|

His design for the Seal of the United States depicted Moses leading the Children of Israel across the Red Sea. Franklin's nickname among his elite secret society chums was "Moses." Like his many Masonic associates in America, England and France, he was an Atonist or in conventional parlance a _Luciferian_. His backers were powerful royal figures such as Charles de Lorraine and the Duke d'Orleans. The last thing on his mind was freedom for the American people. He was a wealthy speculator in land, and a member of the [Vandalia Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalia_%28colony%29), whose land grant happened (coincidentally of course) to have been awarded by the British Crown.||

The secretiveness of the proceedings at the Convention reinforced the suspicions of many critics of the Constitution. Kenneth W. Royce tell us:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Little wonder why the Constitution operated under such extraordinary secrecy. Held on the second floor, windows shut, with sentries posted below, the delegates were sworn to strict silence. Not until 32 years later (a generation, you see) were the proceeding's Journals published. Madison's notes (thoroughly edited) weren't published until 53 years later, in 1840._|

Royce also comments on the measures taken by the Federalists to conceal the infighting that took place among delegates at the Convention:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Great propaganda measures were employed to conceal the Convention's true atmosphere of acrimonious dissent._|

The state of affairs was noted by a journalist_,_ who wrote:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_So great is the unanimity, we hear, that prevails in the Convention, upon all great federal subjects, that it has been proposed to call the room in which they assemble - Unanimity Hall_ - (_Pennsylvania Packet and Daily Advertiser,_ 19 July 1787)|

Fifty five delegates attended the Philadelphia Convention - forty one politicians and thirty four lawyers. Not a single person from the working class was present. Those men who attempted to delay proceedings by boycotting the Convention were sought out by troops and forcibly dragged to the Convention hall.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Electing the respected General George Washington as Convention president, with the added presence of Benjamin Franklin, was responsible for much of the public's "false confidences." Of the 55 delegates, 41 were politicians and 34 were lawyers...According to delegate James McHenry, at least 21 of the 55 delegates favored some form of monarchy_ - Kenneth W. Royce  <br>  <br>_…in 1782 (Washington) received a letter from Colonel Lewis Nicola urging him to use the army to make himself King. He rejected the proposal with great indignation. Washington, it seems felt that America would eventually become a monarchy; indeed, he admitted the necessity of the principle of monarchy. But it seems he could not reconcile this view with his Templar philosophy, which demanded a republic_ - Nicholas Hagger (_The Secret History of the West_)|

Prime-mover in the conspiracy to undermine the Articles of Confederation was the traitor Alexander Hamilton. In _The Federalist Papers,_ Douglas Adair comments on Hamilton's dilemma:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Hamilton's disillusion with the workings of the Confederation and his fear of democracy, especially after Shay's Rebellion, had convinced him that it would be almost impossible to set up a stable republic in a country as large as the United States. As he informed the Convention, any society in which political power was vested in the hands of all the people would be continually torn by the class struggles of the rich and poor. Hamilton's remedy for this class war the Hobbesian expedient of setting up a leviathan state to impose order upon the American People from above, Hamilton was sure that the only alternative to social anarchy was the establishment of a consolidated government capable of maintaining itself independently of the people's will._|

Hamilton's tactics worked. He knew the mindset of the men he represented. He knew all he had to do was instill enough fear into the delegates to achieve the desired result. Federalists and Globalists continue to employ this ruse to further agendas. It is little more than conflict control.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_That was the genius of the Constitution: To 1. utterly transform political reality without the people understanding it; 2. destroy the States without sound or smoke and 3. foist a government destined to become, over the distant horizon, fully national in scope and authority. By the time the States and the people would realize they'd been trumped, it would be too late_ _-_ Kenneth W. Royce|

Hamilton, Madison and their Federalist gang of conspirators were ecstatic over the success of their "divide and rule" tactics. After the damage was done Madison bragged about the debacle he had deliberately helped foment:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_One anti-federalist opinion tell us that the proposed constitution ought to be rejected because it is not a confederation of the States, but a government over individuals. Another admits that it ought to be a government over individuals to a certain extent but by no means to extent proposed. A third does not object to a government over individuals but to the want of a bill of rights. A fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a bill of rights but contends that it ought to be declaratory, not for the personal rights of individuals, but of the rights reserved to the States in their political capacity. A fifth is of the opinion that a bill of rights of any sort would be superfluous and misplaced and that the plan would be unexceptional except for the fatal power of regulating the times and place of elections._|

Thomas Jefferson (principle author of the Declaration of Independence) was appalled at the liberties taken by Hamilton and those he continued taking in the years following the Constitution's ratification. He noticed Hamilton was contemptuous of the Constitution he himself cheer-led, and as ambitiously attempting to obtain broader powers for central government. Hamilton soon proposed changes well outside the scope of the Constitution's precepts. Obviously, the Constitution was merely one means to many ends for Hamilton and his self-serving aristocratic cronies. Incensed by Hamilton's scheming Jefferson wrote:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_I will not suffer...the slanders of Hamilton whose history, from the moment at which history can stoop to notice him, is a tissue of machinations against the liberty of the country which has not only received and given him bread, but heaped honors on his head -_ (Jefferson to Washington, 1792)|

Eventually even Hamilton's colleague James Madison began to chafe at his obvious disdain for the people and Constitutional provisos:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_As Madison watched Hamilton's program develop, he became disillusioned and bitter. In the Convention he had fought to create a Constitution under which 'the interests and rights of every class of citizen should be duly represented and understood.' Now he saw the machinery of his new government being used to exploit the mass of the people in the interest of a small minority -_ Douglas Adair (_The Fede__ralist Papers_)|

Among Hamilton's most insidious programs was the creation of the first private bank. He pushed for the establishment of this scurrilously extortionist organization. His co-conspirator, arch-traitor Robert Morris, was undoubtedly an agent of European aristocracy.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Financial genius Robert Morris organized the first bank. He and his associates believed that the bank should be modeled after the Bank of England…Secret investors put up $400,000 to start this bank. This attempt failed after two short years…Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, submitted a proposal to Congress in 1790 for a central bank. Interestingly enough, Hamilton had been an aide of Robert Morris in the initial experience of central banking in North America_ - Bill Hughes (_The Secret Terrorists_)|

Norman Dodd, Research Director of the 1950s Reese Commission - which investigated America's tax-exempt foundations - finally uncovered the dirt on Morris:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Robert Morris (signer of the Declaration of Independence) was the personality in this country who used his fortune to finance the Continental army and at the end of the revolution, Mr. Morris found himself diluted of his fortune. So after the revolution was over he then turned his attention to, as an individual, of rebuilding a fortune and his area of activity was in land speculation. At that time he was contacted by an agent of wealth lodged abroad and this wealth was represented by an entity which is historically referred to as the “House of Orange.” However, we did know the agent of the House of Orange who contacted Robert Morris after he began to rebuild his fortune, and that personality was a man by the name of Haym Saloman, and he was an agent of the House of Orange in this country, and it was through him that Mr. Morris was offered considerable financial accommodation, which would enable him to, working capital, you might say, to rebuild his fortune._|

Haym Soloman was, of course, a servant of the Jewish Kahal and Jesuit Order. Like the Rothschilds who rose to power shortly after his time, Solomon was a lackey of European royalty - the Hanoverians, Hapsburgs, Stuarts, and related houses. King George III (America's arch-enemy) was a senior member of the Dutch House of Orange or Hanover.

The double-headed eagle (emblem of Scottish Rite Masonry) is _identical_ to the royal arms of European dynasties such as the Hapsburgs.|These royal dynasties own corporations and businesses all over the world and have the power and skill to purchase and use men as easily as they do companies. Of course they do not openly display their colors. They are discreet and prefer to exercise control by way of devious but disposable agents, faceless companies and shadowy banking houses. One of the most important aristocratically controlled engines is the Society General of Belgium. From 1840 to 1870 (before the Rothschilds were handed the wheel), this financial consortium was directly controlled by Belgium's King Leopold II, grandson of Queen Victoria and member of the powerful Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty. The Society was founded in 1822, by none other than King William I of the House of Orange. America's number one enemy, King George III, was of the same royal line as William I. Their ancestor, Duchess Sophia of Hanover was heir to the English throne.|

Her son became George I of Great Britain. His grandson was infamous King George III. These monarchs were members of the so-called "Black Nobility" of Venice and Holland. By way of their financial consortiums they and their relatives maintained control _remotely_ over colonies that included America.

Because of the intervention of men such as Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, the Federalist program to socially and economically undermine America temporarily failed. But time was on the side of the conspiring Nationalists. The second Federal Bank was established six years later, in 1816. President Monroe appointed Jesuit agent Nicholas Biddle as its first president.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Nicholas Biddle, another one of their agents, carried out phase two of the Jesuit attack. Biddle was a brilliant financier, having graduated from the University of Pennsylvania at the age of thirteen. He was a master of the science of money. By the time that Jackson had come to the Presidency in 1828, Biddle was in full control of the Federal government’s central bank. This was not the first time that a central bank had been established. Twice before, first under Robert Morris, and then under Alexander Hamilton, had a central bank been tried, but in both cases it had failed because of fraudulent actions on the part of the bankers who were in control. After the war of 1812, a central bank was tried again, and it was in this third attempt that we find Mr. Biddle -_ Bill Hughes (_The Secret Terrorists_)|

The scandalous intrigue of affluent, influential Jewish financier families, such as Rothschild, Oppenheimer, Lazard, Warburg, Schiff, Kuhn, Loeb, Goldman Sachs, and so on, has been tracked and delineated by several authors.   

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Under the surface, the Rothschilds long had a powerful influence in dictating American financial laws. The law records show that they were powers in the old Bank of the United States -_ Gustavus Meyers (_History of the Great American Fortunes_)|

The evidence clearly shows these families were no friends of America. Certain select Jewish families have allied themselves with the world's senior conspiratorial dynasties, serving as loyal deputies in order to empower themselves. Jewish individuals and families have served the Assyrians, Normans, Merovingians, Templars, Moors, Ottomans, Byzantines, Hanoverians, Hapsburgs, Bismarck’s Prussians, Catholic Church, British and Dutch royals, etc. They are by no means the architects of world conspiracy, as misinformed researchers often believe, but they have been and are willing co-conspirators doing the bidding of their royal overlords.  
  
The Rothschilds in particular received prestigious awards from America's deadliest enemies. For services rendered, leading members of the Rothschild family have been endowed with elite status by royals and popes. Amschel Mayer Rothschild, for example, was a Knight of Malta.

Mayer Amschel Rothschild took over the reigns from his father. He was a Knight of Malta. Elite Masonic Jews have long worked as money men and advisers to Turks, Huns, and Church of Rome. Mayer died in 1855, which means he was in a position to involve himself in the conspiracy to open the second US Federal bank.

Nathan Mayer Rothschild was in charge of the London branch of his family's banking cartel. He was already working in the Stock Exchange from 1804. He established his London bank in 1811. He died in 1836. Of course, long before Nathan's time, Jewish financiers had been active in England. For example, during the Civil War (1642–1651), Manasseh Ben Israel, funded the tyrant Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell personally overturned the legislation banning Jews from England.

James Mayer Rothschild was adviser to two French kings. Highly decorated, he and his four brothers were bestowed the hereditary title of Baron by Austria's Francis II (the Holy Roman Emperor). James was also appointed consul-general of the Austrian Empire and, in 1823, was awarded the French Legion of Honor. The predecessors of the Rothschilds were the Hahn family. The Rothschilds are related to the Bauers, Oppenheimers, Warburgs and Schiffs. These Sabbatean (Luciferian) crime-families, hiding behind orthodox Judaism, were able lieutenants of royalty. They were and are _not_ the Architects of Control, as many misinformed authors believe. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html) for more...)

The facts show that traitorous Nationalists (or should we say _Internationalists_), such as Hamilton, Morris, Solomon, Burr and Biddle did not have the best interests of ordinary Americans at heart. On the contrary, by way of their Constitution, and later by way of their banks and credit houses, they sought to subjugate and impoverish the citizens of America. In his excellent books _The Secret Terrorists_ and _Enemy Unmasked_, Bill Hughes details the strong-arm methods used by Biddle to force wary President Andrew Jackson into commissioning the founding of the Federal Bank:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Biddle responded to Jackson refusing to allow him to re-establish the central bank by shrinking the nation’s money supply. He did this by refusing to make loans. By so doing, he upended the economy and money disappeared. Unemployment ran high. Companies  went bankrupt because they could not pay their loans…So confident was he that he publicly boasted that he had caused the economic wars in America._  <br>  <br>_Is there no danger to our liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature has so little to bind it to our country? Is there not cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war? Controlling our currency, receiving our public monies, and holding themselves in dependence, it would be more formidable and dangerous than a naval and military power of the enemy_ - President Andrew Jackson|

Because Andrew Jackson persistently resisted the threats and devices of the bankers, he was the victim of an attempted assassination. The gunman was a certain Richard Lawrence. G. Edward Griffin wrote:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_…Lawrence...boasted to friends that he had been in touch with powerful people in Europe who had promised to protect him from punishment should he be caught_ - (_The Creature from Jekyll Island_)|

The Federal bankers caused the Depression of 1929, and saw to it that thousands of American businesses were ruined. They funded Adolf Hitler, and financed Lenin's murderous Bolsheviks. Avaricious financial organizations that plague the planet, such as the World Bank and IMF (International Monetary Fund), are merely tentacles of the Federal System.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Immense sums belonging to our national depositors have been given to Germany on no collateral security whatsoever…Billions upon billions of our money has been pumped into Germany by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks -_ H. S. Kenan (_The Federal Reserve Bank_)|

Sir Joseph Stamp was director of the Bank of England from 1928 to 1941. He openly addressed the colossal power of the Bankers:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of hand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in iniquity and born in sin. Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of a pen they will create enough money to buy it back again...Take this great power away from them and all great fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for then this would be a better and happier world to live in. But if you want to continue to be slaves of the banks and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let the bankers continue to create money and control credit._|

President Thomas Jefferson was not a Freemason, and not the least bit interested in amassing personal wealth. He had no love for the Federal bank and made his position clear:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_A private central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army...We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt._  <br>  <br>_I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered._|

Jefferson also warned that although America should do business with other countries, it must stay well out of their domestic affairs and avoid becoming entangled in foreign conflicts. This policy alone would have saved America and Americans for enormous suffering and loss. Jefferson wisely said: _Commerce with all nations, alliance with none_  

Nevertheless Jefferson's reputation is marred on several accounts, not least by his appointment of British agent Albert Gallatin as Secretary of the Treasury in 1801. In the same year Gallatin was also appointed Vice President. Regrettably, a statue of the duplicitous Geneva-born Gallatin stands to this day outside the United States Treasury building in Washington DC.  
  
It is interesting and suggestive to note that Alexander Hamilton's banking system precisely paralleled that used by British bankers. He favored what is known as the tontine capitalist system:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_His tontine scheme, fashioned after the British tontine of 1789, involved a system of rights of annual payments to survivors, the annuities therefrom becoming the means of creating a permanent investment class_ - Frank Bourgin (_The Great Challenge: The Myth of Laissez-Faire in the Early Republic_)|

Political figures of intelligence and cunning knew the real reason for the War of Independence. They knew it had to do with money and usury, and with nationwide colonization, confiscation, and extortion. They knew the conflict was fomented by British and European banks, eager to establish control over America, as they had throughout the world. This fact is admitted by British agent Benjamin Franklin whose comment takes us to the heart of the matter:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The inability of the Colonists to get power to issue their own money permanently out of the hands of King George III and the international bankers, was the prime reason for the revolutionary war_|

The Colonists were not able to free themselves from the clutches of the international bankers and royal overlords. The War of Independence was not a victory for the citizens of America. On the contrary, it was yet one more victory for the aristocracy that has controlled America from the beginning.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_As with the real first bank, the government had been the only depositor to put up any real money, with the remainder being raised from loans the investors made to each other, using the magic of fractional reserve banking. When time came for renewal of the charter, the bankers were warning of bad times ahead if they didn't get what they wanted. The charter was not renewed. Five month later Britain had attacked America and started the war of 1812_ - (_Money as History_)  <br>  <br>_Few people are aware today that the history of the United States, since the Revolution in 1776, has been, in large part, the story of an epic struggle to get free, and stay free, of control by the European international banks. This struggle was finally lost in 1913, when President Woodrow Wilson signed the into effect the Federal Reserve Act, putting the International Banking Cartel in charge of creating America's money -_ Paul Grignon (_Money as Debt_)|

Thomas Jefferson mentioned the nefarious power of the bankers directly, saying desperately:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution - taking from the federal government their power of borrowing._|

After Alexander Hamilton's gang had established the Federal Bank, and the Judiciary with its unlimited power, Jefferson's illusions concerning America's fate were gone. In 1821, five years before he died, he recorded his misgivings and foreboding:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_It has long...been my opinion...that the germ of dissolution of our federal judiciary is in the constitution of the federal judiciary; an irresponsible body working like gravity by night and by day, gaining a little today and a little tomorrow, and advancing its noiseless step like a thief over the field of jurisdiction, until all shall be usurped from the states, and the government of all be consolidated into one. To this I am opposed, because when all government...shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another, and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated._  <br>  <br>_Our government is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit, by consolidation first, and then corruption, its necessary consequences._|

The following year Jefferson's insight sharpened all the more. His words reveal the accuracy of his foresight:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_If ever this vast country is brought under a single government, it will be one of the most extensive corruption..._|

In fact Jefferson had misgivings about the state of affairs in America many years before he wrote these words.  Between 1784 and 1789 he had been living in France as minister to that country. Upon his return to America he was horrified to see how little effect the grand precepts and provisos of the Declaration of Independence, which he had chiefly formulated, had made. Alfred Jay Knock explains:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_On arriving in New York and resuming his place in the social life of the country, he was greatly depressed by the discovery that the principles of the Declaration had gone wholly by the board. No one spoke of natural rights and popular sovereignty, it would seem actually that no one had ever heard of them. On the contrary, everyone was talking about the pressing need of a strong central coercive authority, able to check the incursions which the "democratic spirit" was likely to incite upon "the men of principle and property"...Clearly, though the Declaration might have been the charter of American independence, it was in no sense the charter of the new American State -_ (_Our Enemy: the State_)|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||![Picture](https://www.michaeltsarion.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/3284603_1.jpg)<br><br>Thomas Jefferson. Along with William Paterson, Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, he put state rights before the demands of insatiable tyrannous Federalists. He understood that the Constitution works on a state level, but does not work when it is interpreted and implemented on the Federal level, by men who can not only force states to submit to the Federal will, but who print money to thereby cover up their failures and perpetuate their unsustainable policies that would be shot down on the state level.<br><br>---||

Patrick Henry, long time critic of the Constitution's drafters, also clearly foresaw the totalitarianism of the Federalists:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_My great objection to this Government is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights; or of waging war against tyrants...Have we the means of resisting disciplined armies, when our only defense, the militia, is put into the hands of Congress?_ - (Speech of 5 June, 1788)  <br>  <br>_Did you ever read of any revolution in any nation, brought about by the punishment of those in power, inflicted by those who had no power at all?...Will your Mace-bearer be a match for a disciplined regiment?...Will the oppressor ever let go of the oppressed? Was there ever an instance? Can the annals of mankind exhibit one single example, where rulers, overcharged with power, willingly let go of the oppressed?_ - ibid  <br>  <br>_A standing army we shall have also, to execute the execrable commands of tyranny_ - ibid|

Alfred Jay Nock summarizes the travesty and the tragedy in these words:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Nowhere in the history of the constitutional period do we find the faintest suggestion of the Declaration's doctrine of natural rights, and we find its doctrine of popular sovereignty not only continuing in abeyance, but constitutionally estopped from ever reappearing. Nowhere do we find a trace of the Declaration's theory of government, on the contrary, we find it expressly repudiated. The new political mechanism was a faithful replica of the old disestablished British model, but so far improved and strengthened as to be incomparably more close-working and efficient...presenting more attractive possibilities of capture and control -_ (_Our Enemy: the State_)|

Nothing that governments do is new. Despots within government operate according to plans that are repeated in various ways over generations. Their control is aided and abetted by their co-conspirators in the media. The politicians and media spin doctors are instructed by overlords who control the private banks and "philanthropic" foundations.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment nothing can fail. Without it nothing can succeed. He who molds opinion is greater than he who enacts laws_ - Abraham Lincoln|

In many cases the politicians, media men and bankers are themselves under the tutelage and direction of British and European aristocracy who have made the "board," so to speak, on which the great geopolitical games are played.  
  
The conspirators who organize the geopolitical game are cautious and do not want their true allegiances or diabolical schemes to be publicly exposed. Each group and individual conspirator knows how vulnerable they are. They know the facts about their true allegiances and agendas must never leak out to the masses at large. Their success depends upon human apathy and ignorance.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_In "Red Dusk and the Morrow"...by Sir Paul Dukes, formerly Chief of the British Secret Service in Russia, we read that a Lithuanian asked a prominent Bolshevik how the regime was maintained. The answer was: "Our power is based on three things: first, on Jewish brains; secondly, on Lettish and Chinese bayonets; and thirdly, on the crass stupidity of the Russian people_ - Denis Fahey (_The Rulers of Russia_)|

The elitist conspirators also know that should civil unrest occur, the masses can be forced back into line by threats to their material and emotional security. The strategy is tried and true, and usually works wonders. As Ernest Hemingway explained:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency; the second is war. Both bring a temporary prosperity and both bring a permanent ruin. But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists_.|

||The Trinity of Slavery. This basic diagram delineates how Setian-Atonist royals maintain world control. By way of theology and politics are human hearts and minds enslaved. Through secret societies the hierarchy of control is perpetuated and monitored. As French poet Charles Peguy wrote: "Tyranny is always better organized that freedom."  <br>  <br>Because of the confessions and evidence provided by intelligent, informed whistle-blowers from _within_ religion, politics, royalty and masonry, we know a great deal about how the engines of world and mind control operate. However there are pitfalls when insiders with myopic insight and inflexible allegiances and prejudices attempt to instruct the masses as to the intricacies of oligarchic control.||

||An alternative schemata of the pyramid of enslavement shows that sociopolitical power descends from the highest unseen level to operatives making up the elusive Black Nobility. From this ancient network we get the infamous Illuminati and Jesuit Order. Next, a measure of power flows down to the level of the many secret societies that plague the world. Although these denominations may have a Protestant or Catholic, liberal or conservative, coloring, they are all controlled by the same nefarious Luciferian elite. From here, when necessary, sociopolitical power is loaned to the world's ardent psychotic occult "Jews," or more correctly _Sabbateans_. The highest echelon within this branch know their ideology has little to do with official Judaism, as it has been put before us. They know they are the privileged descendants of ancestors who have long served ancient imperial concerns, such as the Merovingians, Templars, Black Nobility and British Crown. Power flows downwards and is carefully allocated to certain deputy orgs whose members know little about the architecture of world control. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-1.html) for more on Atonism and world conspiracy.)||

Philosopher Ayn Rand frequently warned readers about the evils of big government:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Instead of being a protector of man’s rights, the government is becoming their most dangerous violator; instead of guarding freedom the government is establishing slavery; instead of protecting men from the initiators of physical force, the government is initiating physical force and coercion in any manner and issue it pleases; instead of serving as the instrument of objectivity in human relationships, the government is creating a deadly subterranean reign of uncertainty and fear…instead of protecting men from injury by whim, the government is arrogating to itself the power of unlimited whim, so that we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission; which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force._|

Rand laid it on the line when addressing the crimes of government:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Criminals are a small minority in any age or community. And the harm they have dome to mankind is infinitesimal when compared to the horrors - the bloodshed, the wars, the persecution, the famines, the enslavements, the wholesale destruction - perpetrated by mankind’s governments._ _Potentially, a government is the most dangerous threat to man’s rights - When unlimited and unrestricted by individual rights, a government is men’s deadliest enemy._|

Before her perceptive words were written, French philosopher Pierre Joseph Proudhon addressed the "people versus government" problem:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_To be Governed is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. To be Governed is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be placed under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality_ - (_General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century_)|

Victorian philosopher Herbert Spencer pondered whether man requires governments at all:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_What, then, do they (Humans) want a government for? Not to regulate commerce; not to educate the people; not to teach religion; not to administer charity; not to make roads and railways; but simply to defend the natural rights of man - to protect person and property - to prevent the aggressions of the powerful upon the weak - in a word, to administer justice. This is the natural, the original, office of a government. It was not intended to do less: it ought not to be allowed to do more -_ (_The Man Versus the State_)|

He also wrote:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The great political superstition of the past was the divine right of kings. The great political superstition of the present is the divine right of parliaments._|

Father of the Anarchist movement, Mikhail Bakunin - who spent many years imprisoned in dungeons - knew all about government oppression. For him governments were unnecessary institutions that darkened the world:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The liberty of man consists solely in this, that he obeys the laws of nature, because he has himself recognized them as such, and not because they have been imposed upon him externally by any foreign will whatsoever, human or divine, collective or individual_ - (_God and the State_, 1882)|

German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche understood why governments exist, and how they maintain their malignant dominion:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...a fullness of state power such as only despotism had enjoyed...surpassed all the past because it strove for the formal annihilation of the individual...Once the earth is brought under all-embracing economic control, then mankind will find it has been reduced to machinery in its service, as a monstrous clockwork system of ever smaller, more finely adjusted wheels._|

Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega Y Gasset explained State corruption in these words:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_This is the gravest danger that today threatens civilization: State intervention, the absorption of all spontaneous social effort by the State, that is to say, of spontaneous historical action, which in the long-run sustains, nourishes and impels human destinies._|

His sentiments were shared by the American critic Henry L. Menken, who said the Federal State:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...has spread out its powers until they penetrate to every act of the citizen, however secret, it has begun to throw around its operations the high dignity and impeccability of a State religion, its agents become a separate and superior caste, with authority to bind and loose...But it still remains, as it was in the beginning, the common enemy of all well-disposed industrious and decent men._|

In his important book on State totalitarianism, _Our Enemy: the State,_ Albert Jay Nock explained the motives of State officials:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_It is unfortunately none too well understood that, just as the State has no money of its own, so it has no power of its own. All power it has is what society gives it, plus what it confiscates from time to time on one pretext or another; there is no other source from which State power can be drawn. Therefore every assumption of State power, whether by gift or seizure, leaves society with so much less power; there is never, nor can be, any strengthening of State power without a corresponding and roughly equivalent depletion of social power._|

Nock understands that there is not a jot of difference between American Federalists and the diabolical Socialists who have plagued the world. He put the matter plainly:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The superficial distinctions of Fascism, Bolshevism, Hitlerism, are the concern of journalists and publicists, the serious student sees in them only one root-idea of a complete conversion of social power to State power...The positive testimony of history is that the State invariably had its origin in conquest and confiscation. No known State known to history originated in any other manner._|

They manipulated the fact that Americans were traumatized and exhausted by war. They stage-managed the Conventions and controlled media reportage of events in Virginia and Philadelphia.     <br>  <br>If the people had the time to relax and educate themselves, if they had paid attention to the warnings of Thomas Paine, Patrick Henry, and the other critics who suspected what the conspirators were planning, the Constitution would never have been ratified.   ​|

The best the people belatedly received was the Bill of Rights drafted in 1791. It was expressly created to _protect_ people against potential abuses of the ill-received Constitution. It was conceded to the American people by Madison, who by then had secured all that he and his Federalist colleagues demanded.   

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_A number of states had accepted the Constitution with urgent recommendations for changes. At first, it seemed that Congress would pay no attention to these suggestions. Patrick Henry and other then set up a clamor which had to be heeded, and Congress referred the proposals to a committee -_ Nevins and Commanger (_Pocket History of the U.S._)  <br>  <br>_The federalists delayed ratification of the Bill of Rights for over two years while they organized the new federal courts and armed the judges with powers to counter individual rights -_ Kenneth W. Royce|

The Federalists instigated virtual panic, and made sure the people were not able to take time to repair and think. Their representatives and delegates were harried into accepting and signing the Constitution. The same methods of "conflict control" have been used throughout the generations. They are still being put to good use by politicians and parties. In the 1960s, Ex-Communist Jerry Kirk discovered how the great game is played. He eloquently explained the process in these words:   

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The idea is to create a situation where the people are so frightened of the chaos all around them, that they will throw their arms up in the air and shout “Federal Government, do something!” And the only choice open will be Martial Law…The Communists, black militants and revolutionaries will never succeed in overthrowing the government of the United States, but unless they are stopped, they will scare the American people into accepting Socialism from Washington, and status rule from the Establishment. This is what it is really all about._|

Expert on the British takeover of America, G. Edward Griffin, explains the mechanics of conflict-control in these words:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_…deliberately create problems, and then offer only those solutions which result in the expansion of government. Create conditions so frightful at home and abroad that the abandonment of personal liberties and national sovereignty will appear as a reasonable price for a return to domestic tranquility and world peace_ - (_The Capitalist Conspiracy_)|

Student Socialist agitator James S. Kunen also discovered how the upper echelon conspires to foment social unrest, so the true enemies of freedom remain undetected:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_In the evening we went up to the University to check out a strategy meeting. A kid was giving a report on the SDS Convention. He said that...at the Convention men from Business International Round Tables...tried to buy up a few radicals...These men are the world's leading industrialists and they convene to decide how our lives are going to go. These are the guys who wrote the Alliance for Progress. They are the left wing of the ruling class...They offered to finance our demonstrations in Chicago (l968). We were offered Esso (Rockefeller) money. They want us to make a lot of radical commotion so they can look more in the center as they move to the left_ - (_The Strawberry Statement: Notes of a College Revolutionary_)|

The scrapping of the US Constitution is essential. Americans must revise and update the Articles of Confederation and abolish the corrupt totalitarian Federal apparatus of control. Americans must wake up from their delirium and find out what kind of conspiracy has been occurring in their land. They must contemplate the words of Bertrand de Jouvenal, who said "A society of sheep must in time beget a government of wolves," and remember that it was mutineers and not conformists who founded America.  
  
The traitors are still with us. Indeed their treachery is greater than ever. Hiding behind the Constitution and political process they see to it America's ports are sold and that schools are swamped and under-funded. Because of their scandalous policies America's heavy industry operates at a minimum. American businesses are throttled by legality and taxation, while foreign-made products fill the shelves. Companies and jobs are perpetually outsourced, prisons supersize and innocent men and women languish behind bars to be raped and tortured. Poisons fall from the sky in the form of chemtrails, and illegal aliens occupy like invading armies, enjoying the "fruits" they did nothing to cultivate or harvest. It all occurs in a country that came out of World War II richer than it went in.  
  
Why is this the case? What has happened? Why have so few taken so much from so many for so long?  

Oriental countries prosper and rise economically. The Third World is fast becoming the First World, while the First World nose-dives into ruin. This was the plan from the outset. It is the result of _tyranny_ not democracy. It is also the result of apathy. No truer words on the subject were stated than those by President Abraham Lincoln:

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_These United States of America can never be destroyed from forces outside its borders. If America falls, it will fall from within. Brought down by apathy. When good people do nothing, Anarchy reigns_ - (Letter to Congress, 1854)|

Lincoln also emphasized the despotism of wealthy oligarchs who prosper from the ignorance and apathy of the masses.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than a monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, more selfish than bureaucracy._|

Robert Maynard Hutchins also commented on the apathetic state brought on by over-stimulation and trauma:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush. It will be a slow extinction from apathy, indifference, and undernourishment._|

Senator from Nevada, George W. Malone, made the following statement before Congress in 1957:

||_I believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what Congress has done to them over the last 49 years, they would move on Washington; they would not wait for an election...It adds up to a preconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of the United States!_|

Ironically, during and after the War of Independence the eyes of the world were on America. The Czar of Russia, Nicholas Romanov II, admired what he saw taking place and, before his brutal assassination, was ready to emulate the scintillating American experiment. During the War of Independence he sent ships, money and troops to assist American rebels. Russia and many other countries would have changed for the better had Americans not been cajoled into adopting the Constitution.

|The good news is that even the most oppressive tyranny cannot last forever. Once the tyrant and his heinous industry is exposed, the game is up. At that point they can be overthrown, and things can be put aright. It has happened in Ireland and the Congo, in Cuba and Nicaragua, and many other lands. But the enemy knows this only too well. He understands that he is vulnerable, and is aware of how he could be undermined. As a result, he is constantly on guard. He knows that his activities and methods must not be properly scrutinized. Consequently, he makes a point of keeping his subjects in fear for their lives. He prefers them to be limbic creatures unable to reason and discern good from bad and right from wrong. He makes sure their attention is focused elsewhere, and that strange, demented, and frightening "enemies" are always rattling the gates. Through his obedient agents, he funds and controls the supposed enemies, and instructs them how to operate.   <br>  <br>In this manner is the great game of geopolitics and mass control played. It is simply chess on a global level. Should a pawn fall off the board or be sacrificed, the kings, queens and bishops do not turn a hair. The comfortably placed misleaders bang the drums of war and send dedicated men and women to fight and die for the "United States" _corporation_.   <br>  <br>The U.S. is a _business_, and those who have given their lives for it died uselessly. Tragically they have been sacrificed at the behest of their country's true enemies. As Count Leo Tolstoy wisely said "Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us."|![Picture](https://www.michaeltsarion.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/published/3829226_1.jpg?1583879079)<br><br>  <br>George William Frederick (George III), King of Great Britain and Hanover. He was a member of the Hanover dynasty - the so-called House of Orange. Like numerous royals, he was a demented maniac who suffered from mental disease. According to author George Trevelyan, he vowed "never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal." He wanted to "keep the rebels harassed, anxious and poor, until the day when, by a natural and inevitable process, discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse."<br><br>---||

During the war he and his brother were captured, held prisoner and nearly starved to death. When Andrew refused to clean the boots of a Red Coat, he was slashed with a sword which left him with scars on his head and left hand. His brother Robert died from smallpox contracted while a captive. Jackson's immediate family died from wartime hardships. As a result of these horrific experiences Jackson never forgave the British oppressors.  <br><br>---|Our point is simple. We insist that the predators and parasites who have vampirized America and the world must be closely studied. Understanding how and why they function as they do provides us with the keys of worldly salvation.  <br>  <br>Moreover, we must understand that the elite despots of the world are creatures of habit. The enjoy repetition and their nefarious strategies are tried and true. Additionally, we must understand that these demagogues bank on one human weakness, _forgetfulness_. Historical amnesia hands them the power they covet. As Milan Kundera so appropriately said: "The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting."   <br>  <br>The answer to humankind's future lies in remembering what has transpired in history. It lies in not repeating past mistakes, and not falling for the same tired political fallacies. Furthermore, we must end our psychological dependence on the fiends who have established despotic forms of government and who benefit from our allegiance. As long as we consciously or unconsciously identify with the predator, we will never see the demise of tyranny, regardless of the political action taken. It will raise its ugly head time after time. Ultimately we must judge our misleaders by their _deeds_ rather than their words.|

We must be on guard against their rhetoric and sophistry, and not hesitate to use existing laws to prevent them doing their worst. We must not be afraid to seek justice when degenerate, self-serving politicians - supposedly acting in our name - seek to lead us astray.

||_Civil disobedience is not our problem. Our problem is civil obedience. Our problem is that numbers of people all over the world have obeyed the dictates of the leaders of their government and have gone to war, and millions have been killed because of this obedience...Our problem is that people are obedient all over the world in the face of poverty and starvation and stupidity, and war, and cruelty. Our problem is that people are obedient while the jails are full of petty thieves, and all the while the grand thieves are running the country. That's our problem_ - Howard Zinn|

As Tony Benn perceptively stated: _Americans don't care about politics, only about politicians_.|The Articles of Confederation worked to bring security to all Americans. They restored order after the chaos of the War of Independence. Unlike the US Constitution, the Articles of Confederation honored the rights of individual States.   <br>  <br>The Articles did not distinguish between rich and poor. They were meant for _Citizens_, not "People," and did not permit an oligarchy to assume totalitarian control. The men who drafted and ratified the US Constitution were hungry for power _over_ human beings. They adamantly wanted to protect their own prestige and wealth. Despite their megalomania they knew what they wanted and how to go about getting it. They acted like proverbial wolves in sheep's clothing.  <br>  <br>Their Constitution is deceptive in form and substance, and served to permit an predatory oligarchy to ensconce itself in America.|

The American-based aristocrats may not wear crowns or sit upon thrones, but they are in many cases directly related or connected to royal dynasties of Britain and Europe.  
  
George W. Bush is for example a distant cousin of John Kerry, the presidential nominee who ran against him in 2004. Kerry's parents are not Irish but Jewish. On the matter of his aristocratic ancestry we read:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Senator John Kerry has blue blood from all the royal houses of Europe, with even more titled relations than President Bush…Burke’s Peerage, which researches the genealogy, said the Democratic presidential candidate traces descent through his mother, Rosemary Forbes, to the royal houses of Albania, England, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Russia, Byzantium, Persia (Iran) and France. Forbes was descended from William Forbes, the Laird of Newe, and extended family that included many baronets…It is via this family that the Democratic candidate is descended from Henry II, the king of England and father of Richard the Lionheart, who was the leader of the third Crusade in 1189…By contrast, Bush is related to Queen Elizabeth II, twenty British dukes and many European princes…President Bush, Princess Diana and Winston Churchill are distantly related_ - (Union Jack Newspaper; September 2000 Edition)|

George H. W. Bush and wife Barbara are related to the same British oligarchs. Additionally, George is:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...closely related to every European monarch on and off the throne – and has kinship with every member of Britain’s royal family, the House of Windsor. He is the 13th cousin of Britain’s Queen Mother, and of her daughter Queen Elizabeth, and is the 13th cousin once removed of the heir to the throne, Prince Charles. Bush’s family tree can be documented as far back as the early 15th century. He has a direct descent from Henry III and from Henry VIII’s sister Mary Tudor who was also the wife of Louis XI of France. He is also descended from Charles II of England_ - David Icke (_Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster_)  <br>  <br>_Father George and wife Barbara are both descendants of Godfroi de Bouillon who, in 1099, led European noblemen in the successful Crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the Islamic faith and moved into the King’s palace at Temple Mount…Godfroi de Bouillon was the first king of Jerusalem and the Duke of Lower Lorraine, a major region for the Illuminati bloodline_ - ibid|

So much for oligarchic control from on high. It's a subject I'll explore in later work.  
  
The average patriotic American will, nine times out of ten, favor the rule of states over federal structures. That's all very commendable, but the fact is that the governors and administrators of states are no more in favor of individualism and freedom than those sitting in Washington DC. In some cases, they're even _less_ interested in championing the civil rights of the populace.  
  
In many cases, the federal system needs to exist in order to minimize and combat violations imposed by state-employed gangsters on the people. This is incontestable by rational people. Assaults on the rights of individuals come from _both_ the federal _and_ state levels. It's simply erroneous to believe that one is better and more humane than the other. Both are, in general, indifferent to a man's true rights and ambitions. Each and every political platform known today is rooted in corruption and racketeering of such a high level that the ordinary man has no chance whatsoever doing anything positive about it. What Americans call "Democracy" is itself the _lowest_ and least efficient form of government, utterly rejected by the ancients who decided that even tyranny served people better than mob-rule, since one was not deceived into thinking they actually wielded real power, as one does in Democratic systems. The power in a Democracy is that of the mob, which is no power at all.

|---|_A conspiracy is nothing but a secret agreement of a number of men for the pursuance of policies which they dare not admit in public_ - Mark Twain|---|

We see that the time has come for the veils of mystique to be torn away from the so-called "Fathers" of the Constitution. They were not champions of a free, sovereign nation, and their legacy is neither auspicious nor grand. They chose to subvert the Articles that guaranteed freedom to every American. Coveting power they made themselves fabulously rich by exploiting the masses who, instead of fighting the evil in front of them, rather denounced those warning of its presence.  
  
In our time their villainous counterparts in government have shifted into overdrive. Their heinous acts of conquest, extortion and confiscation know no bounds. As long as ignorance of the enemy's nature persists, nothing will change, and the pirates of Capitol Hill will continue to ply their insidious trade. As King George once demanded, the war against America was to be waged _eternally_. His desire is being fulfilled as every day passes. Unless the Machiavellian intrigues of his biological and ideological descendants are exposed and overcome, America's ruin is certain. The task is, however, impossible without _knowledge_ of the adversary. Knowledge is the weapon we must use to eradicate the imperious predators that lurk behind the long grass. of history.

||_“Conspiracy!” One of the darkest words in the language of man. Yet there is hardly a single page of History that does not partially reveal the deadly eye of Conspiracy at work. It was a conspiracy that lead Brutus against Caesar in the Roman senate on the Ides of March...that plotted the betrayal of West Point by Benedict Arnold, during the American Revolution…that led John Wilkes Booth to the assassination of President Lincoln on Good Friday 1865. The past record of man is burdened with accounts of assassinations, secret combines, palace plots and betrayals in war._ _But in spite of this clear record, an amazing number of people have begun to scoff at the possibility of conspiracy at work today. They dismiss such an idea merely as a conspiratorial view_ - G. Edward Griffin|

Knowledge of the enemy is the golden key that opens the gate to a future free of tyranny and slavery. We not only owe our children a freer future - we owe a debt to our forebears. The men who fought and labored to create the elements of civilization we enjoy, but who were treacherously pilloried and subverted, must be remembered and reverently toasted. It is _their_ memory we honor, not that of their infernal destroyers.
