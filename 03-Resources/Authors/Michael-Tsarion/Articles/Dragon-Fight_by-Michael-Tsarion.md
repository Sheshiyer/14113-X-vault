_Although psychology and pedagogy has always maintained the belief that a child is a happy being without conflicts, and have assumed that the suffering of adults are the result of the burdens and hardships of reality, it must be asserted that just the opposite is true...what we learn about the child and the adult through psychoanalysis shows that all the sufferings of later life are for the most part repetitions of these earlier ones, and that every child in the first years of life goes through an immeasurable degree of suffering_ - Melanie Klein  

Although the mother-daughter relationship is of particular importance, it has not been dealt with sufficiently by Feminist writers, who irrationally contextualize all commentary on female psychology and sexuality in terms of the malevolent authoritarian male-dominated Patriarchy. They steer well clear of any worthy critique of their own sex's role in establishing structures oft cited as oppressive.  
  
It is now dawning on some intelligent women that this trendy approach is highly inadequate. It offers few important insights and leads attention away from far more vital issues.  
  
A daughter born from an necrophilous mother is not going to enter the solar world as a rational, heroic being. She will have endured a long dragon-fight with her mother, and had her will undermined and humiliated time and again. In order to remain sane she will probably have reluctantly accepted the directives of her terrible mother. She will also be inclined to direct her hatred not toward her rival, but toward other objects. In her efforts to disguise and displace rage harbored against her mother, the victimized young girl may choose to openly idolize womankind, femininity and motherhood. Her self-deception may force her to become a Feminist, like millions of other deluded women around her.  
  
Her mother will be ecstatic at this, hoping her daughter perpetuates her acts of self-deception. After all, she has everything to gain from it. She basks in the adoration born from her child's dissociation and denial of legitimate pain and anger. Once her daughter is corded to her through affected envy and adoration, the terrible mother can make her life hell. She dehumanizes her daughter, treating her merely as a surrogate self by which to relive her own youth and animate her empty existence. The daughter's identity matters not a jot. She is simply there as a means to an end.  
  
A cunning mother may inundate her daughter with praise and compliments just to secure her favor and attention. The duped daughter unwittingly loses most of her identity in her devouring mother, whose unwholesome existence is made less tragic by her daughter's innocence, sexuality, desires, expectations, successes and man-interest.

Demeter and Persephone. In this myth, as in others, the loss of the Dragon Fight is obliquely referred to as a "rape." Feminist writers do their darnedest to misrepresent this, exonerating mothers in the process. Losing the Dragon Fight - succumbing to the necrophilous will of a terrible mother - means that the daughter's perception of the male world (in the myth, the "Underworld") is drastically and permanently warped.  

This is a very common syndrome in the lives of a great many girls and young women. Not that most of them know anything about it. The situation is responsible for a girl's unrealistic view of femininity and motherhood, and is certainly the reason for other neurotic tendencies. It accounts for why so many girls grow to become smother-mothers and helicopter-parents themselves.  
  
The rise of Feminism is, as said, directly caused by this scenario. The devoured daughter must hide her pain, misery and hatred from herself. The truth about her envious, possessive, schizoid mother must be rationalized. So, to compensate for legitimate feelings of repulsion, a daughter entrains herself to see no evil in anything females think, do or create. It's all good, and whatever evil there is comes from men. Most feminized women hold onto this fiction for dear life, and will not willingly relinquish it. There's too much to lose by so doing. Living in the ashes as a half-self is better than facing the icy reproaches of a terrible mother.  
  
The strategy of the terrible mother fails once the daughter intelligently reviews her domestic situation, asking herself: if I am continually berated and punished for every alleged infraction, am I also fairly and openly rewarded for good deeds? If the answer is no, the spell is soon broken and the true nature of the terrible parent is revealed.  
  
It is also important to note whether a parent's praise is for truly moral acts. It might be lavished for _immoral_ acts, or for one's submission and obedience. If one acts morally, yet receives constant disapproval from a parent, again one soon comes to see the latter's hypocritical, perverse nature.  
  
An awakened daughter, aware of their parent's true face, may experience bouts of such revulsion against her mother that her own femininity and sexuality is severely compromised. Due to the syndrome of repressed _matrophobia,_ a daughter may become asexual, frigid, self-abusive, man-hating, withdrawn and chronically passive.  
  
A huge cache of mother-hate boils like lava below the surface, causing psychosomatic exhaustion, emotional suffering, neurotic traits, and/or a cocktail of persistent physical ailments. If a woman in this condition pushes herself to marry and birth children, the consequences for her well-being, and that of her  family, are dire. A society proliferating with dissociated women of this type is also bound to become dysfunctional, irrational, schizogenic and nihilistic.  
  
As said earlier, the dragon-fight is commonly known in psychological parlance as the Oedipal Complex, or in terms of a young girl's development, the Electra Complex. There are five main stages, starting approximately at 2 years of age, and ending around 7 years of age, from the Oral to the Latency stage. It is not common for most psychologists to ever speak, as I do here, of these stages demarcating a power-struggle between the wills of parents and children. Yet, according to psychologist Alice Miller, this is exactly what they do demarcate. The sooner we realize it the better for one and all.  
  
In my work I stress that the long struggle of wills - which can continue to puberty and beyond - not only determines the character of a child, adolescent or teenager, but also their political outlook. Psychologically arrested boys and girls grow to detest masculinity, heroism, and the so-called "Patriarchy," habitually blaming it for any and all difficulties and imperfections. They never wholly and willingly confront the so-called Reality Principle.  
  
So blinded have most women become to the truth of themselves, that they are simply unable to do anything else except blame males and the representatives of the solar world for all perceived ills. That their animosity toward the world of the father has its origin in the toxic consciousness of their mothers, is a matter never faced and addressed. On the contrary, the terrible mother's outlook is sanctified and embodied, leading to the cocktail of aberrant complexes and syndromes plaguing women today.

Daughter dear, my psychic life is over...I need you to fill my emptiness..._I demand it!_  

Knowing nothing about female psychology, a girl may live through the years of puberty thinking her mother is her best friend and astute guide. There is no way for her to confirm or deny this until a great deal of damage has already been done.  
  
She may not realize that her mother's relationship to her is intensely needy, competitive and emotionally incestuous. In many cases a terrible mother may not wish to see her daughter sexually mature, show interest in boys, date and eventually marry. Although she may wish for grandchildren, she may not not relish where they came from. She may frown on how they are raised, berating her daughter about her supposed incompetence. She may constantly intrude into her daughter's life, relishing every domestic upheaval, disapproving of her daughter's husband, criticizing him endlessly. All this just to make her daughter miserable, doubtful, guilty and dependent.  
  
One strange dynamic of the great dragon-fight is the ambivalence of a daughter in relation to her mother's presence and influence. A daughter may partly identify with her mother, but may also subconsciously loathe her presence, interference and controlling behavior. Boys and girls are usually full of rage toward their parents from an early age, but are trapped by a love-hate or attraction-repulsion dynamic. One despises the parents depended upon for survival and nurture. One despises them when they withhold comfort and care, when they punish for every infraction (or for no good reason), refusing to praise for good deeds done.  
  
As detailed earlier, to lessen tension, most children partly resolve this ambivalence by identifying with the tyrannical, hypocritical parent, to all intents and purposes becoming as they are and behaving as they do. This perverse identification entails the suppression of conscience and the voice of the Imperial Self. It entails the formation of the superego which internalizes parental standards, forcing conformity to the malignant will of the parents.  
  
The superego is also the instigator of guilt feelings and means by which aspects of the Imperial Self are cast into the darkness of the unconscious. It is, in this sense, the cause of psychic dissociation blinding us to the insanity of normality. It makes it possible for us to be guided through life by the misguided.  
  
The superego forces us to live a lie and disregard legitimate emotions. After its development completes (around age 6 or 7) it orients us toward the Reality Principle - the solar world which serves both as a haven from the effects and after-effects of the dragon-fight, and as a source of power against the terrible mother.  
  
Nevertheless, regardless of one's apparent adjustment to society's norms, the rage against the parent boils within, and is all too often misdirected toward the solar world, not to mention one's own children, should they exist.  
  
Throughout the twentieth century, women were driven to enter the solar world in order to find the weapons to liberate themselves from the devouring "medusan" mother. Concealing their true intent from themselves, many women convinced themselves they were seeking "empowerment," in a desire to equalize themselves with men. Most women still fall for this delusion, preferring their self-deceptiveness to the truth of the matter.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/empoweredwoman.jpg?1598457865)

Identification with the neurotic parent doesn't end just because the superego prevents one consciously addressing it. Since it proved to be the way one semi-successfully dealt with the cache of rage against the parent, identification won't be relinquished easily. However, it is this irrational identification with the unsane, tyrannous parent that causes considerable inner tension, the result of antagonism between superego and conscience, or ego and Self.  
  
The identification is hard to break as long as one still foolishly looks to the terrible mother for the power she promised to extend. "Identify with my will, and I'll bestow my power on you," says the terrible mother, in not so many words. "Be good, and it will all be yours to do with as you will...Look at the control I have over your idiot father...don't you want such power over men out there?"  
  
This is particularly unbearable for any girl who thinks they've earned their reward, and gone through living hell to get it. To finally discover it was all a sick joke, merely increases the cache of rage within that will one day need to be expressed and exorcised. The theater for this unholy exorcism is usually the daughter's own family unit.  
  
So, for a Oedipal child and post-Oedipal adolescent we have a major Catch-22 situation. The child despises the abuses of the adult, yet becomes a disciple of Adultism. In an attempt to escape the problem, the superego directs us toward the solar world, where we hope to find power from another source, one we can turn against the hated parent.  
  
This change in trajectory is complicated after a child sees the genitalia of their mother. The child fixates on the false idea that some power, greater than hers, has dealt her a blow, rendering her wounded and bloody. At this point the child's identification graduates from the lunar to the solar world, from the feminine to the masculine, from the unconscious to the conscious. Although girls recognize their biological similarity to their mothers, psychologically they tell themselves "I don't want to look like _that_...I don't want to be a wounded soul...I prefer the company of men and admire them for their phallic forthrightness and strength." Hence Freud's misunderstood "Penis Envy," which is nothing less than the salvation for feminized girls, forcing them to reset their coordinates and exit the medusan abyss.  
  
Before the transition occurs, a girl remains transfixed by the power held by their mother. However, their identification with the terrible mother comes not from love and true affiliation, but from the need to inherit the tyrannous power that seemed awesome and fearsome in infancy when mother towered over one as the source of life or death.  
  
Before the all-important psychic break, a girl continues looking to her mother for what she needs. True to form, the terrible mother plays on his need, encouraging their daughter to develop _erotic_ power over men, and to become narcissistic, seductive and immoral. For most girls this constitutes the end of their search. Through their sexual mystique they attain the power they desire over the world, courtesy of their dear mothers. Entire fashion, cosmetic and media industries have arisen helping them hone their perverse skills in this regard. (See [Chapter One](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QV8MH8Z/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i4) for more on this...)  
  
A hypersexual, seductive girl - subtly directed to use her mystique for deceptive and corrupt purposes - inwardly despises herself and her terrible mother for setting up such an immoral dynamic. After all, on some level the girl knows she has no _authentic_ power. Her power is inhuman and destructive. All the while she wields her pseudo-power, she comes to despise herself more and more. Eventually she realizes that her sexual wiles are not a sign of power but of weakness. Whether she consciously accuses her mother of setting her on this futile path or not, we cannot easily say. Some girls may get to grips with this fact, others may not.  
  
Despite this identification with the terrible mother, there is also the dread of her _not_ sharing her power. Whereas a goodly mother prepares her daughter to enter the solar world (and embody the Reality Principle), the terrible mother breaks her promise and does not permit her daughter to exit the darkness of the lunar world. She lures her daughter with promises of power, but never imparts it. She imprisons her daughter in her lunar webs, ensuring she remains bland, nondescript, will-less and devoid of power. This is the case for many ultra-feminized women today.  
  
Girls in this condition, undermined by their terrible mothers, are likely to become overly dependent on strong males. They attract what I call the "Chivalric Male," entering into a dysfunctional relationship with him. Their presence in a man's life is _always_ a handicap. Chivalric men don't realize the ruin awaiting them due to their well-meaning adoration of feminized females. Their inability to think and function effectively has direct consequences for the advancement of civilization. It's a problem no amount of political action corrects.  
  
What we know today as the MGTOW movement is largely made up of disenchanted Chivalric types reacting against female abusiveness. This type means well, but is impaired by a serious lack of psychological insight into the predicaments they face. Knee-jerk reactivity over female narcissism, man-hate and abuse doesn't mean one has understood the criminal history of womankind, or that one has a modicum of psychological understanding about women.  
  
The maturing girl who successfully embodies the Reality Principle, and who enters the solar world, may not be aware of her mother's considerable envy. Falling for appearances, she doesn't realize that her mother hates her for being sane, rational, attractive, sensitive, genial and moral. Her subconscious reaction to this is to be overly affectionate toward her terrible mother, whose demands upon her time and energy never end.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/mothdsugter.jpg?1598457842)

There can be no healing and progress until girls begin fathoming the consequences to their psyche and sexuality of the dragon-fight. They must determine how much they have succumbed to the will of their terrible mothers. This insight requires levels of introspection uncommon today. Most girls and adult women have no interest in undertaking self-analysis in this regard. If there are problems and difficulties in their lives, one has only to blame the nearest male. A million professional Feminists are there to back you up.  
  
Ironically, the feminization of the solar world means that the chimera of power offered to a child or adult, to be wielded against the terrible mother, no longer exists. There will not be any respite from the stygian abyss of the lunar world, and no power available to subdue the terrible mother.  

**.**  

The Feminist critique of the male world, and refusal of most women to admit parental imperfections, prevents us seeing the truth about social decay.  
  
Given the present state of affairs, the terrible mother comes out the winner. For all her abuses, she walks away free of guilt. Nevertheless, she is the instigator of the dragon-fight and cannot avoid taking the blame for the damage she's wrought over her son's or daughter's life.  
  
The child she bore enters the fight defensively. This is why the image of the terrible mother's genital "wound" has such a profound effect on the mind of a child passing through the Oedipal Stages. Children would not be fixated on the image of the castrated mother, nor fear her as a castrator, if they were treated decently and lovingly.  
  
The mother is certainly regarded as the chief castrator, even though she is usually sly enough to threaten her child with "daddy's" ire. She terrifies her child by way of the father, priest, teacher, headmaster, doctor or psychiatrist. But despite this, the child non-consciously knows what is what. He or she has to choose between identification with the oppressor, or going in search of a power to overcome her. This is how we truly build the authoritarian Patriarchy that Feminists disingenuously claim to loathe. The day will never come when they will address its _true_ cause. To do so means the ruin of their ideologies and propagandist rhetoric.  
  
This is how we get chronic Adultism, autophobia, delinquency, animal cruelty and sexual perversity. This is how we get crime, addiction, gender fluidity and deviance, crowd consciousness, political correctness, socialism and fascism. This is how we get the chronic envy of masculinity, greatness, heroism and creativity.  
  
Little does a child realize that their need to overcome and emasculate the terrible mother is quite legitimate. Children spend their days beating themselves up for legitimate feelings of rage. Parents and society, by way of the superego, prevent expression of these feelings. The superego makes sure they don't rise to impair ego function. Psychologically, this act of suppression is referred to as _repression._ However, as said before, we must never allow ourselves to forget that repression is simply the psychic equivalent of _oppression._ It is the result of Adultism and the dragon-fight initiated by toxic parents.  
  
Feminists wish to completely downplay the question and reality of female violence. Any malignancy tracked to women is _always_ contextualized in terms of male malevolence. It is the result of male faults, projections and primitive standards. It is the result of women's enslavement in the Patriarchy, and blowback against their heroic protestations against stereotyping and demonization. It is _never_ because women, like men, _are_ violent, oppressive, ruthless, cunning, envious, seductive, murderous and pathological.  
  
It is never because a mother misuses her power, or capitalizes on the relative weakness and innocence of her offspring. It is never because, as an abused person herself, she births children in order to replay her own dragon-fight, when her will was crushed by that of _her_ terrible mother.  
  
So, round and round we go on the merry-go-round, spoon-fed lie and after lie by Feminist writers deliberately placing all the blame at the feet of males. They have read well from the Fabian-Marxist hymn sheet, and taken up the dirty work initiated by neo-Marxist thinkers such as Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Derrida, and others of their sinister brood who have long used women as doomsday weapons against Western civilization.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/mothdaug.jpg?1598469768)

The time has come for us to raise the question of the terrible mother, and stop looking to Feminist critiques of Patriarchy for answers. As time passes we will begin to see the fraudulence of most Feminist positions. At that time we will need sounder answers like never before. We will find ourselves having to look to _psychology_ rather than politics, particularly in regards the problem of the female psyche.  
  
Only when terrible mothers see themselves as terrible mothers will things change for the better. This stage can only be reached when the children born to them - specifically daughters - make it possible for them to do so. This stage can only be reached when women become interested in their own psychology. Instead of running amok in the political arena, or ingesting the lies of Feminists, they need to address the grave problems of female mystique, matrophobia, and of the dragon-fight that turned them into haters of themselves and the solar world.  
  
Every female who wishes to be "empowered," has only one road to walk - that which leads her to the door of her terrible mother. This confrontation entails the awakening of admiration for males and the solar world. It means the masculinization of the female and relinquishing of pseudo-empowerment via mystique and seductiveness.  
  
It means seeing through the false critiques and directives of Feminists, desperate for women to bring down the masculine world they've been trained to despise. It means that women must see who and what has truly brought about their disempowerment by expertly steering them _away_ from the legitimate object of their hate.  
  
The mandate of the Feminist is to make it impossible for well-meaning women to discover the source of their weakness, envy and hatred. Every women attempts to discover the truth of themselves in inauthentic ways, endorsed by the Establishment, such as by having children earlier and earlier in life. This is the course taken by many young women, in the non-conscious hope they can replay their dragon-fight and come out on top, exorcising themselves of their darkness, pain and relative impotency.  
  
Of course, this is the fool's choice. It does not lead to healing and well-being, either for oneself or for society. One merely recasts themselves as the tyrant in the tyrant's stead. In deep frustration one can only speak of male dominance, patriarchal oppression, inequality, and political reform. Things get steadily worse despite it, and one gets further and further estranged from the voice of conscience. In the end one is directed by the very force - that of the Collective - itself brought into being by pathological self-deception; the Crowd being a surrogate source of empowerment for those without inherent strength of will.  
  
But the will of the Many can only provide temporary feelings of empowerment and purpose. External charge is no substitute for internal willfulness and heroism. As we see from observing current events, the will of the Crowd is necrophilous. It turns not against the true object of hate - the will of the terrible mother - but against the masculine solar world which poses no threat to it at all, and without which it would simply implode into nothingness.  
  
Once again, the remedy is for the victims of the terrible mother's malignant will to turn to the _true_ object of their hatred, hearkening in a psychological awakening never seen before. No amount of political action or reform will bring this transformation about, as the Fabian-Marxists know all too well.  
  
The architects of destruction cannot afford us to awaken psychologically, or confront the will of the terrible parent, it being one of the most useful weapons in the hands of the world controllers.  
  
As a result of the dragon-fight, we are arrested at the lunar level and infantilized. The condition is, for many, a permanent one. To prevent complete psychic meltdown, the unsane person is inundated with unlimited distractions. He enjoys an endless supply of love scenes and car chases. He can wile his time away forever in the loud, colorful, busy circus provided by his manic, episodic society. He can allow his consciousness to be utterly colonized by the will of the Masses, and when it all gets overwhelming, or when the voice of conscience returns to pester him, there is always Big Pharma to dispense the "happy pills," making everything right again.  
  
In this mutilated state, the good citizen votes for those leaders moving us toward a moonlit _anti-psychological_ age, in which one is never troubled by talk of minds, wills and morals. Obedience to the will of Everyone is all that is required for peace and contentment. Utter passivity and conformity guarantees affluence.  
  
In this way the solar world ceases to be truly solar. It starts taking on the features of the lower lunar abyss. As Gustave Le Bon pointed out, it becomes feminized in the malignant sense. Even the leader isn't to be considered the masculine authority figure he or she appears to be. It's all a chimera and parody. Bit by bit the walls of the masculine world break down. Heroism is slowly recast and countermanded, and everyone trained to accept being _equal in misery_.  
  
The terrible mother _plays_ at morality. Behind her mask (and domestic role) she is either amoral or immoral. It follows that our society must be psychologically impaired to let this situation continue and allow women of this sort to go completely unpunished.  
  
Our society handicaps itself by ignoring the utter severity of the problem of the terrible mother, giving her free rein over her children's psyches, characters and behavior. A massive upgrading in psychological understanding and insight is therefore a must, if the problem is to be addressed and corrected.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/mirrorlady-fotor.jpg?1598458044)

The first step in this process is the end of enthrallment. We must cease adoring women just because they are women. Because of this mass infatuation with the female archetype - and compulsive deification of womankind - suffering plagues the children of the world. And since women have long basked in the glow of adoration, and learned how to expertly capitalize upon it by way of mystique, the problem will not end if left in their hands.  
  
The gross sense of entitlement embodied by most women has absolutely no rational grounds. It arises from the age-old glorification of everything female, and constitutes a major impediment to progress. Political Feminism, as we know it, is nothing less than the outward expression of irrational female vanity gone wild. But it is not only men who stand to lose because of it. Women will find themselves losing everything they've enjoyed for decades. Getting extra rights and becoming "equal" with men was one thing; taking over the world and treating men as second-class citizens, in the name of equality, is another. It's a disingenuous act bringing our world to ruin.  
  
Throughout this book, and throughout _Dragon Mother_, I show how misgiven and wrongheaded are women's attacks against Patriarchy and the male world. Women  brought the solar world into being as much as men. The proofs for this are presented in previous chapters.  
  
Solutions to the problems delineated here have also been suggested. Instead of envying and hating men, women need to bring up their daughters to admire and assist men. Flaws in the male character can be intelligently corrected in due course. But women's faults and derangement must also be directly and sanely addressed and remedied if disaster is to be avoided and harmony finally experienced.  
  
But instead of admiration and assistance we have accusation, anger, ridicule and competitiveness. Why do feminized women blame men and the Patriarchal world for all ills? They do so because of psychic displacement. Everyone and everything is blamed except the true offender.  
  
The girl or woman who has identified with the tyrant mother remains under her spell and cannot meet her frightful medusan gaze, lest she be turned to stone. Even pathological cording to a sick self-absorbed mother promises some kind of emotional connection, mutuality and reciprocal caring. Of course after one awakens, the futility of such thinking stands clear. It is the terrible mother who is made of stone, not the daughter.  
  
The victimized daughter who frees herself from the baneful influence of her terrible mother has no reason to project her anger and hatred onto innocent men. The victim who does not free herself continues projecting blame on men. Indeed, in certain cases such a woman may will tragic events into her life. She manifests a rape or other act of violence. She attracts thuggish men who violate her, unaware that they've provided her with the justification she obsessively needs for dissociation and self-deception to continue. She is perversely elated when a man brutalizes and berates her, steals her possessions, spends her money and cheats on her.  
  
Such men are dear to her and she makes a point of memorizing their every infraction and slight. Topped up with male-hatred she convinces herself that men are obscene creatures, and soon has nothing more to do with them. If  married, she soon rids herself of her husband, gaining complete control over her kids. With men cast as the evil in her life, she absolves her mother of any blame, and is now free to become a terrible mother herself.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/thuglove.jpg?1598457896)

This has become the contemptible formula by which most women avoid facing the truth about their dragon-fight. As long as men stand to be blamed for all ills, for stealing and crushing a woman's essence, there's no reason for the actual malefactor to be confronted, no reason for one to correctly process inner rage and become whole.  
  
One remains self-raped, self-violated, and self-enslaved to the will of the terrible mother. Of course, one convinces themselves they are liberated and empowered. Joining in with the political Thugocracy, adding one's voice to theirs, screaming about equality and social justice, is all part of the act born form chronic self-deception.  
  
Too bad that the contrived formula only suffices temporarily, and doesn't ultimately heal one's inner wound. A deranged woman's denial of men is symptomatic of the negation of her own masculinity. Consequently, her disowned masculinity returns in malevolent form, forcing her to pay the price for being a mutilated self. Her Animus returns in demonic form to pluck the femininity from her soul, casting it into oblivion. What remains is an obscenity; a sterile, cold, bitter, miserable, venomous banshee bringing pain, misery and loss to everyone she encounters. No mirror bears her reflection.  
  
Women in this situation - victims of the war within between their Anima and Animus - don't care about the plight of women through history. This is just a feigned concern, a handy ready-made rationalization perpetuating continued self-deception. The political histrionics and highfalutin verbiage from feminized types about women's "rights" fools the world, but has zero effect on the conscience.  
  
There can be no chance of sanity and healing until women in this dissociated condition realize the damage they do by breeding. A world full of children born to psychologically mutilated mothers is the world's great problem, _not Patriarchy!_  
  
What Feminists fail to understand is that the man who discriminates against women, is probably the son of a women who discriminated against _herself,_ locking away key aspects of herself, preventing the unification of her masculine and feminine polarities, intent on exonerating her own terrible mother of all blame. The man who supports a society in which women are treated as second class citizens, responds unconsciously to what his mother has unwittingly conveyed to him about the status and value of women. It follows that the woman whose inner republic is in ruins will be denied power by a society of men born from women of her kind. It's a vicious, necrophilous cycle broken only by psychologically insightful women able to face their Shadows and win the dragon-fight.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/dragfight.jpg?1598469795)

So we get a hold on the essence of the Electra Complex, the stages which demarcate the struggle of wills between parent and child, in this case mother and daughter. We see how this ongoing rivalry is the true cause of psychosocial fallout. It is certainly responsible for a child's political outlooks, their ubiquitous but irrational adoration of the female, and the "all sins forgiven" attitude when it comes to the cruel immoral behavior of narcissistic devouring mothers and women.  
  
The child's will is always overwhelmed and crushed by the will of the adult. Nine times out of ten this forces the child to conform and even identify with the will of the tyrant. Secretly the child hates themselves for this capitulation. This self-hate, added to the more primal cache of raw hatred toward the tyrant, becomes the seed-bed for all future dysfunction, emotionally, intellectually and physically.  
  
The child's self-image is no longer wholesome. It is formed not by the Imperial Self, but by the superego, the psychic representative of the tyrant's will. From before seven years of age, the superego directs the child's behavior and outlook. This situation usually carries on throughout one's life, the superego promising respite, success and belonging for one's reluctant obedience. Disobeying and rebelling only floods one with guilt and shame, which rise to danger levels if resistance continues. In the end one is drowned in neurotic syndromes. In the worse case scenario, the neurotic personality type soon becomes schizophrenic and utterly withdrawn from Self and world.  
  
However, before the onset of severe pathology, the individual is so will-less and docile that he craves the leader and will of the Crowd to animate his life. He thinks as they think and does as they direct. The political world becomes his haven, the place where his constitutional inferiority is disguised from one and all. In the place of a wholesome, heroic Will-to-Meaning, one is driven by the Will-to-Power which soon degenerates into an even less attractive and productive Will-to-Negation. Hence the complexion of the socialist Thugocracy dominating world events and headlines today.

As a member of the Crowd, one never need deal with the Reality Principle. On the contrary, one remains within the confines of the Pleasure Principle in which the pressures of reality are lessened. The society heading in this direction becomes more and more feminized, matriarchal and gynocratic, dangerously so. It's what we see happening throughout the west today. The Crowd cries out for their global utopia, not realizing that the Global Village is merely a surrogate womb promising oblivion to its regressed infantile citizens.  
  
The more that regressed types experience conflict within, the more they crave oblivion in one form or another. They must extinguish the pangs within their being that won't go away. However, as long as a shred of masculinity remains, the regressed person still craves legitimate feelings of power. On a subconscious level they still want to create, achieve and become great. Therefore, until the moment of total absorption and stasis comes, and despite the absurdly fake grin, this type suffers.  
  
Participation Mystique by way of the Crowd animates only briefly. The heave of the Many provides a temporary high for an impoverished soul, but can't prevent the onset of disenchantment, stasis and regression. In the end the regressed type struggles by on drugs, illicit or prescribed, until the Will-to-Negation turns in on them, leaving nothing but ashes and ruins where a Self once existed.  
  
Sad to say, masculine women as well as masculine men are under attack from this. Both have a lot to lose should things continue as they are. Indeed, masculine women constitute the main solution to the problem. All they require is insight into the subject addressed here, namely _female psychology._

Central to this developing insight are some basic truths that topple the Feminist narrative. Firstly, it is a provable fact that all infants and children see the masculine-solar world through their mother's eyes. Their fathers and the external world are not seen for what they actually are. All too often, they are _presented_ to the child by the mother, and colored by her often warped interpretation of them. It makes no sense, therefore, for Feminists to critique this and that aspect of the Patriarchy. It became what it is due to the prejudicial perspectives of terrible mothers, sending their children into it without a modicum of understanding, admiration and pride. The world critiqued by Feminists is the world already contaminated and undermined by the dragon fight.  
  
Secondly, women control the modern world, and are in no way oppressed or discriminated against. They control the vast amount of credit card spending, and one look at the commercial world reveals the evidence for female dominance and privilege. Men have long been second class citizens and bell-boys for superficial, spendthrift, fashion-obsessed women.  
  
Thirdly, women give birth to all men. Therefore, it stands to reason that whatever malignant men do sociopolitically, and whatever ordinary Joes think about women, originates with the women that bred them. Whatever a man thinks about himself, women, the world, or anything else, tracks back to his relationship with his mother. Nothing can ever contradict this truism. That Feminists and most women never discuss this, or admit it, tells us a great deal. It lets us know that something is not right, and that sleight-of-hand is being used against our reason.  
  
Fourthly, the vast majority of rational women prefer the company of Alpha Men, the very ones who work to build the solar "Patriarchal" world. This also severely compromises the position of ardent Feminists.  
  
Fifthly, what is never admitted, is that for most children passing through the dragon-fight, the solar world of the father is regarded as a haven from the struggle of the lunar world, where they experienced the submission of their will and crushing of their authentic identity. It is seen as a less conflictual place offering a bower of repose from the stygian abyss of the medusan mother. Everything about the solar world - including its repugnant elements - is still seen as being better than its opposite. Again, we see from this the inadequacy of Feminist critiques, citing the male world as the source of all ills. In other words, the Patriarchal world comes into being as a refuge from the baneful influence of the feminized female, the terrible mother. What does this truism do for conventional Feminism's preposterous theories?  
  
Finally, Feminists love critiquing the _imperfections_ of the Patriarchal world. It's their stock-in-trade and volumes are written on the subject. However, the entire enterprise is wrongheaded and does not ultimately support the skewed outlooks of Feminism.  
  
Imperfections are overcome with progress. Progress is in turn facilitated when the past is honored and studied. Crucially, progress is made possible by heroic reason, ingenuity and masculine will.  
  
Progress sees the end of imperfections. But the key issue concerns the nature of imperfection. Rather than being a negative phenomena, as Feminists present it, it is the _cause_ of progress and improvement. Indeed, as Hegel showed, there can be no question of progress and perfection without imperfection. It is the _catalyst_ to all positive change and advancement, to the creation and sustainment of the Noosphere. Again, Feminist critiques in this regard lead only to contradiction and fallacy.  
  
It is apparent that Feminism, in most of its hideous guises, exists so women can maintain their camouflage. Any progress in our society of a philosophical and psychological nature, inevitably means for men the upgrading of insight into the female psyche. This denouement has to be opposed and thwarted. Socialism, Feminism, Critical Theory, Postmodernism, Deconstructionism, etc, are the means to this end. They have been established and funded so humanity is held back and denied insight into the most important matter, one effecting every aspect of life, including whether civilization as we've known it survives or perishes.
