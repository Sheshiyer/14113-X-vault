## The Origins of Mind-Stilling

Who first propounded the doctrine, still popular among seekers today, that spiritual enlightenment demands "stilling one's mind?" Was it Shankaracharya, Patanjali, Gautama Buddha, or some forgotten swami? Historically, it's a doctrine dating back to the seventh century in India.

Maybe it was just some deluded priest. Nay, not one priest, rather a *priesthood,* intent on misinterpreting old-world sages. Yes, that's definitely more likely.

There's a lot of corroborating evidence for this theory. If one reads Mircea Eliade, Alan Watts and other informed orientalists, one is shocked to find that well-known practices, such as "zazen," were *not* heard of, and not part of Buddhist practice until centuries had passed, and priests had gained dominance. One can't count the number of rival Buddhist sects that sprung up over the centuries. Division rather than unity is the hallmark of human devilry and *priestly* intrigue.

## The Corruption of Ancient Wisdom

The same goes for Hinduism and Sikhism, etc. For example, orthodox Sikhs do the very *opposite* of what their holy book, the *Adi Granth*, explicitly and repeatedly states. It's no different with other traditions and religions. Contradiction, divisiveness and absurdity are the rules rather than the exceptions. In the mid-eighteenth century, the founders of Sikhism formed their breakaway sect partly due to their opposition to the infamous Hindu caste system. Before long, however, Sikhs simply imposed on their own people their version of the caste system. They are as obsessed by hierarchy as Hindus and Muslims - rotten hierarchies in which corrupt types easily reach the top and good men are heaved overboard. Despite the warnings of their "good book," Sikhs are monumentally and compulsively materialistic. They are one of the most sanctimonious and hypocritical sects on earth.

The few scholars who have made an unbiased study of Pre- and Post-Vedic texts and customs are aware of the degeneration of profound prehistoric philosophies and customs. The odd text, such as the *Tao Te Ching* and *Srimad Bhagavatam,* preserve something of the antique Aryan philosophy later corrupted by devious self-serving priests.

In fact, most of the rites, rituals and ascetic practices endemic to Eastern traditions have little antiquity and less legitimacy than might be imagined. Famous texts such as the Vedas and Puranas are also of relatively late date, and do not faithfully express the ways of the ancients. In fact, they often grossly misrepresent the beliefs and outlooks of elder races and of the East's foremost sages.

## The Priesthood Problem

> **Critical Question:** *The cult of the individual!* What is a priesthood? Why do priests exist? Are they really the dispensers of enlightenment? Does their talk of karma and reincarnation have any basis in fact? Or is it cunningly manufactured to secure an acolyte's submittance? Can one clean their dirty linen by scrubbing the suitcase they're carried around in? Can one cleanse their karma by bathing in the Ganges? So did a famous mystic regale the many swamis and sannyasins who gathered in multitudes in Haridwar, Rishikesh and other important Hindu centers of worship. Their many bizarre customs and antics attract bamboozled onlookers from all over the world.

When it comes to duplicitous priesthoods - especially in the East - division is the rule. Why so many to choose from? Hundreds infest India and surrounding countries. If truth is "one," why so many antagonistic denominations?

And what of the paths to truth offered by each of them? Why do most of them advocate a life of renunciation and asceticism? What compels the average seeker to belong to a Hindu or Buddhist monastery or community? What prompts one to lose their personal identity and serve a guru in a large collective? Why sign on for and embody antihuman and antinatural doctrines without question? Why despise one's own psyche and senses? Why submit one's will to that of another?

## The Evidence of Failure

But, is it really so terrible, comes the response? Well, one look at the state of most Eastern countries gives us the answer. The appalling state of affairs - the poverty, filth, disease, corruption and animal cruelty, etc - stands as the most powerful indictment of predatory priestly organizations and their inhuman beliefs and teachings. For centuries they've made passivity and otherworldliness into virtues. Look at the result. Look at the misery people have endured because of it. Is it holy? Are the perpetrators held responsible?

## The Gnostic Roots

After all, as the great scholar Alvin Boyd Kuhn pointed out, at the heart of Eastern paths are the absurd doctrines of Gnosticism and Asceticism, which demand the rejection of the physical body and natural world. It was deranged men with a Gnostic mindset who propounded what we now recognize as the theories of karma, reincarnation and malignancy of matter. It was Gnostics, the world over, who demonized sexuality and the senses. Their expertise was and is construing the perfectly natural into the unnatural.

> **Kuhn's Warning:** The great writer Alvin Boyd Kuhn (1880-1963). Like Sri Aurobindo, he severely critiqued asceticism, which he said gave rise to many a "Cult of Mortification." This includes most Western religions and monastic orders, as well as most Eastern schools. Before Kuhn, Swiss scholar Johann Bachofen warned of the baneful influence of Eastern spiritualism on European culture.
