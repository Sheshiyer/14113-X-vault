| One evening in 2003 I went to a book-signing event hosted by Barnes and Noble in Seattle's University Village. The author presenting and giving autographs was none other than Graham Hancock.  <br>  <br>I was not a fan _per se_, but was interested in the content of his books, his latest being _Underworld_. In the early '90s I had written a review of his first ponderous book _The Sign and the Seal,_ for a prominent Bay Area bookstore I worked at. I was unimpressed by his verbose writing style, endless self-referencing and inability to _get to the point._ The book ends very unsatisfactorily, given that the elusive prize searched for by Hancock - the Ark of the Covenant - remained elusive. Talk about an anticlimax!  <br>  <br>Unsurprisingly, like his previous undertakings, _Underworld_ was a thundering commercial success. Indeed, Hancock - the darling of Macmillan, Random House and other publishing companies - has made millions from his career as an author of weighty fictional and nonfictional works. His excursions into prehistory, catastrophism and conspiracy prove to be his most popular sellers.  <br>  <br>In 2010 I discovered that Hancock employs at least three ghostwriters, one of whom contacted me because of his interest in the forgotten genius Comyns Beaumont, a researcher whose ideas are central to my revisionist work. During our lengthy conversations, this man let a few things slip about how little research Hancock himself does, and how much he gets paid for it. It didn't leave me with a positive impression.  <br>  <br>Even more to his discredit, Hancock has written a few books with bestselling author Robert Bauval. Their theories on the age of the Great Pyramid, although somewhat controversial, have been widely accepted as true, even when they are nothing of the kind.  <br>  <br>Bauval's pet theory concerning celestial alignments has not been substantiated, and his dating of the building of the Great Pyramid, supported in large part by Hancock, is also erroneous. Nevertheless, Bauval and Hancock have netted many millions purveying their grand but spurious theories. The media has assisted them in becoming renowned and honored the world over. The pair have been invited to appear on numerous high profile TV documentaries and talk shows. Men with more cogent theories never get anything like the coverage. We might question why this is. I guess they're not members of "the Club."  <br>  <br>This man with several bestsellers, millions of sales and nonstop television appearances, never ceases informing his credulous audiences that he's not "mainstream." He perpetually acts as if he's some kind of intrepid maverick catering to a niche market. It's nothing but lies and self-delusion, not to mention fatuous self-aggrandizement. He really is a legend in his own mind.  <br>  <br>Anyway, after Hancock's evening presentation at Seattle's Barnes and Noble, I and an associate stayed behind. Once the crowd departed we approached Hancock and had a fairly lengthy conversation with him.  <br>  <br>My own book _Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation_ had just come out and I brought a copy along to give him as a gift. Hancock read the book's description and became animated. He said that the question addressed in my book, about the _origins of evil_, was of great interest to him. He said he had long pondered the matter and would love to read my take on it. However, he did not suggest staying in touch, and did not offer us one of his own books, plenty of which were on display there.  <br>  <br>As we chatted, I noticed that his wife had a look of absolute indifference on her face. She sat to one side, staring into space like some petrified stick insect that just had a tasty greenfly buzz out of reach. Her glum countenance disturbed me no end. But what of it? Hancock's own demeanor didn't ingratiate me either. He was a rather cold, hostile, self-obsessed and ultimately uninteresting man. At the time I was not aware that he was psychologically unstable and heavily dependent on anti-depressants. I did not know that he self-medicated with enormous doses of marijuana. Had I known about his addictions and state of mind, I would never have attended his presentation or given him my book.  <br>  <br>In any case, as the three of us talked, Hancock launched into a tirade _against_ the media and internet. He was particularly incensed at the way his name had been dragged through the mud by some online detractors. He grew red in the face and loudly announced to us that he was never going to pen another work on controversial subjects again. It wasn't worth it, he bellowed. Three websites, he said, were against him, and a few other television shows were busy mocking him. It was all too much, and as far as he was concerned he was going to retire. I might write another book, he said, but it will be on some totally different subject.  <br>  <br>In fact, in the following years Hancock did write a few fictional works. These have received criticism, given that they are childishly outlandish, gory, perverted and repetitive. Nowadays little is said about his spate of purely fictional writing.  <br>  <br>Contrary to what he insisted that evening, Hancock is once again okay writing about prehistory. He and several other writers became fascinated with the ruins of Gobekli Tepe, and have composed voluminous tomes on the place, each jostling for media attention and headlines. Again, Hancock is the media's darling, receiving considerable coverage over his speculations about the mysterious lost city. |

|---|In April 2019, Hancock's latest book _America Before_ hit bookstores. The subject matter, once again, being prehistory and terrestrial cataclysm. This time his focus is ancient America. It's a fascinating subject to be sure, and had been researched throughout past decades by a few lesser known men. Not that you'll ever hear about them from Hancock.  <br>  <br>On the contrary, as far as _America Before_ is concerned, its author is apparently the sole luminary pontificating on America's prehistory. Rather than citing previous mavericks, he hastens to inform readers that _his_ theories have now been confirmed by at least sixty or so mainstream scientists.  <br>  <br>Hancock reiterates this anecdote on several television programs. However, regardless of his jollies, his statements leave a bitter taste in one's ears. So what! Why does this tickle you, mate? Aren't these experts part of the same status quo that suppressed knowledge and professionally assassinated dissenters from time immemorial? Isn't their work and yours of an alternative kind, flying in the face of establishment paradigms? Aren't you therefore more concerned with exonerating the names of past mavericks now forgotten, men who were ridiculed and left broke? I guess not!|---|

|---|Sadly, this is not the only problem with _America Before_. I wish it were.  <br>  <br>Hancock has seen fit to reprise the theories and findings of past mavericks _without bothering to cite them._ I can't think of anything more perfidious and self-serving. Shame on the author and his publishers for letting him get away with it.  <br>  <br>Of course this omission demonstrates that he's not the least bit interested in getting scientific credibility for anyone but _himself_. To guarantee his own fame he's prepared to grovel and eat out of the establishment's predatory talon.  <br>  <br>The hard proof for Hancock's contemptible capitulation becomes obvious and undeniable as one reads _America Before_. The thievery is appalling and gratuitous. Amazingly, we find no mention of three outstanding pioneers in the subjects of prehistory and catastrophism, namely Ignatius Donnelly, Comyns Beaumont and Immanuel Velikovsky. There is also no mention of the great researchers Augustus Le Plongeon, James Churchward and R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz.  <br>  <br>Immanuel Velikovsky was one of the most ridiculed scholars who ever lived, even though every one of his controversial theories about upheavals in the solar system have been proven correct. Don’t hold your breath waiting for Swank Hank to salute or credit him. He's just another donkey kicking the old lion to death.  <br>  <br>Apparently this is what passes for “scholarship” today. It's a case of feral alley cats grabbing the fish and scampering up the drainpipe. It’s a case of scavenger research that entails airbrushing the names of great men from the canvas, and sticking one’s own scrawl there instead, hoping so much time has passed no one will notice the consummate plagiarism. Swank Hank is a pass master at it, although in this case it’s extra contemptible.  <br>  <br>In the same way as strutting narcissist David Wilcock (“Willy the Weasel”) blatantly stole the theories of Rand Flem-Ath, on the subject of Antarctica, so has Hancock magpied the works of three awesome intellects of past times. In both cases, although their many ideas and findings are reprised, no credit or citation is to be found, which tells you everything about the sickening vanity of the author.  <br>  <br>Comyns Beaumont predated the peddler Hancock by decades. Read his _Mysterious Comet_ published in 1932, and ask yourself where this shameless plagiarist comes off telling the world that he and a team of 60 modern-day “experts” now confirm that an age of catastrophe actually existed? As if the subject requires confirmation by any number of establishment toadies. It's Hancock who goes around soliciting their favor like some beggar, no one else. Honorable people _believe_ Velikovsky, Beaumont and the others, and dutifully give them the credit they deserve in spite of what convention dictates and mainstream "experts" think.  <br>  <br>Despite their media success and public images, Hancock, Bauval and other bandits in their club rode into town on the last goddam bus, to lick up the crumbs of other men’s sumptuous feasts of wisdom. And we lay out the red carpet for their asses, throwing laurels before their unworthy feet, leaving the graves of true sages and geniuses unattended.|---|

Ignatius Donnelly, Immanuel Velikovsky and Comyns Beaumont.  
Lions among braying donkeys.

|---|In 1950 the great catastrophist Immanuel Velikovsky wrote one of the most comprehensive and revealing books on earth cataclysm, _Worlds in Collision._ He also authored _Earth in Upheaval_ and _Ages in Chaos,_ making three titanic works on cometary destruction effecting every aspect of earthly existence. He gets NO mention, not even in the bibliography or index.  <br>  <br>Shame on Macmillan and St. Martin's Press. They are as scurrilous as the author.  <br>  <br>Before Beaumont and Velikovsky was the American maverick researcher Ignatius Donnelly, who wrote two classics on the subjects of Atlantis, ice flow and catastrophe before the twentieth century began. His two master works are _Atlantis: The Ante-Diluvian World_ and _Ragnarok: Age of Fire and Gravel_.|---|

|---|There is also no mention of the great Barry Fell, although his ideas and findings turn up in _America Before_.  <br>  <br>In Volume One of my _Irish Origins of Civilization_, several chapters cover Fell's invaluable work. Sadly, the establishment dismissed him as a crank and his findings were lampooned. His great book is entitled _America BC._ A coincidence of course that Swank Hank's book is titled _America Before._|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|Barry Fell's controversial books _America BC_ and _Saga America_, changed what we know about the migration of the elements of civilization and America's prehistory. _America BC_ was published in 1976. Amazingly, although his discoveries are reprised, the great man's name is not respectfully mentioned by Hancock.|---|

|---|More recently, in the ’90s came two vitally important works on catastrophism from top Cambridge and Oxford scientists Allen and Delair. Their titanic books are _When the Earth Nearly Died_ and _Cataclysm._ The authors mention Velikovsky and his theories, and discuss his radical ideas at length in several chapters. Apparently they found the time and space to credit and cite their predecessors. Amazingly, their work is not mentioned by Hancock who pretends to seek scientific credibility. Well, someone tell him that credibility and proof ooze from the books of these two eminent scientists whose research is second to none. Be sure to ask him why he is silent about their extraordinary contributions?  <br>  <br>How much do you want to bet that both their books are to be found in Hancock’s home library, thrown into that special corner of books labeled “…to be plagiarized later, after I’ve run out of ideas?”  <br>  <br>I’m sickened to my stomach and can only implore readers to purchase each book mentioned here, and never forget predecessors who made no millions from their works, and after falling foul of the system suffered worldwide ridicule, dying in relative obscurity.  <br>  <br>Don’t allow crumbs like Swank Hank to scavenge Donnelly, Beaumont, Velikovsky, Le Plongeon, Fell and others, regurgitating their ideas _without credit and citiation_. Don’t be party to the crime.  <br>  <br>Intellectual dishonesty is one of the worst offenses. It’s not allowed in universities and should not be allowed in open society just because the author gets his books onto best seller lists and the window displays of prominent bookshops, sitting back with a self-satisfied insider-smile, basking in the glow of other men’s light.|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|Published in 2000, _Shattering the Myths of Darwinism_, by Richard Milton, is another exceptional work jam-packed with scientific proofs pertaining to revisionist science and natural history. Curiously, it's not mentioned anywhere by Hancock. If he were really obsessed by scientific endorsement, why not openly and repeatedly cite this splendid ground-breaking book?|---|

|---|Before he took up his Indiana Jones wannabe career, the great and noble Swank Hank was press secretary for an Ethiopian dictator and mass murderer (Mengistu Haile Mariam). Practically every reference to this has been dutifully scrubbed from the internet, and interviews where he was directly confronted about his notorious past (such as on Hard Talk, or something like it) strangely can’t be found. Friends in high places it seems.  <br>  <br>After so many years, it appears he hasn’t change his spots. Once again he, his publishers and many ghostwriters have shrink-wrapped the ideas of mighty intellects, schlepping them out under false pretences before a gormless public.  <br>  <br>Bring back the stocks!|
