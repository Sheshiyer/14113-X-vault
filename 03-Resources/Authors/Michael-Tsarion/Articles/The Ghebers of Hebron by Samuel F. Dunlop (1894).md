|---|**Priestly Deception**  <br>Let us never forget that we have to do with the writings of a caste of priests in Judea, whose sacred stories, whatever their relation to history, were presumably connected with the interests of their caste.  <br>  <br>**Missing Dates** **of Exodus**  <br>There is no date in Genesis and Exodus, nor of the Egyptian dynasties.  <br>  <br>**Western Original**  <br>The scanty relics of the Aryan languages of Asia Minor found in inscriptions and the glosses of Greek grammarians belong to the Western division of the (Aryan) family - Prof. A. H. Sayce  <br>   <br>**The Ghebers (or Ghiborim)**  <br>We trace this people back to a most interesting source the city of the Achabara then occupied by a race of mighty warriors called the Kheta (Hetha) who defended themselves later against Ramses the Great. It stood in the mountains west of the Dead Sea where Chebron, one of the oldest cities of Judah (now called Hebron), stands. The word Acbar means 'mighty,' and the Egyptians knew the Achabara by that name, for at an early period they never entirely conquered them. From the word Cabar or Gabar (also meaning 'mighty ') comes the word Geber or Gheber which (as the Kheta of Khebron were fire-worshipers) was in time used to denote the ancient people who were, like all the Old Canaanites, very much controlled by that form of religion. (See Genesis 17:7 & Deut 5:24)  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Let us not forget that despite the colorful descriptions of these races being of giant stature, that the opposite is as likely the case. The Ghebers, Hebers or Ebers, might actually have been the Little People, downplayed by historians and forgotten by history - Mtsar<br><br> <br><br>- Note: The Cabar were perhaps a kindred race, perhaps identical with Kabiri (Kab Ari). Kheta similar to Le Plongeon’s Katti (or Phoenicians-Goth-Hittites. See also Waddell.) Gheber is most likely rendered correctly as _Heber_, connoting the far west and the giants from those lands known as Hyperborea or Hibernia (See also "Hebrides") - Mtsar<br><br> **The Khatti (Hittites)**  <br>The Bible describes the Phoenicians in the north as Kananites, in the south as Pelestim or Philistians. The land Caleb (Egyptian Khalebu) was near the district of the Katti (Kheth or Keth) at Hebron, while the Khatti (Katti Kheta) extended to the south as far as the country of the lower Ruthen (Arad) and Idumea (Mt. Seir, Edom).  <br>   <br>The Khati (Hittites) had from remote antiquity a form of picture-writing which was known on the road between Ephesus and Sardis, and also from Kappadokia to the Aegean Sea. (See Rawlinson, _Ancient Egypt II_ and A. H. Sayce, _Biblical Archaeology_)  <br>  <br><br>- Note: As L. A. Waddell shows, this group were also known as the Cads, Khad, Khadites, Khadians, etc. Beaumont has them as the Okkads or Akkads, since their original homeland was Northern Scotland, specifically what are now the Orkney and Shetlands Islands - Mtsar<br><br> **Fire-Worship**  <br>Kebir is a name of fire. The Gebirs are the fire-worshipers, and the Cabiri are the seven spirits of fire. Compare the Arabian idol Heber and the Ghebers at Hebron.  <br>   <br>**Adon**  <br>Over all this region Adonis (Saturn) was adored under various names by the fire-worshipers; for they called Dionysus-Adon (Adonis) in the Lebanon, Adoni and Adonai in Jerusalem, Sat, Set, in Philistia and Seb or Sabi in Arabia. Euripides, Herodotus, and Movers leave no doubt upon the point.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: For some cultures it was a case of a singular deity in dyadic form, experiencing two realities - the upper _and_ lower worlds, the overworld of light and underworld of darkness. Hence the biune god Set-Adonis, Osiris-Horus, Set-Aton, etc. The same occurs for many goddesses who possess a solar _and_ lunar aspect.<br><br> The Jewish religion is a form of the Dionysus-worship; and Adonis, Adonai, Osiris, Dionysus, all are the Sun – S. F. Dunlop  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So much for rabbinical protestations against connecting their Adonai (Jehovah) with Adonis, Adon or Aton. The facts reveal their deceptiveness in this regard. Theit deity and religious motifs are undoubtedly pagan in origin. Indeed, the situation for the Jews and Christians becomes even more precarious should the Phoenician Adon derive from Nordic climes with Donar or Odin. Certainly, the Garden of Eden derives from the Nordic Idinn and Asgard - land of the gods with central tree of life Yggdrasil. ([Here](http://www.astrotheologyzone.com/) and [Here](https://infogalactic.com/info/I%C3%B0unn) for more...)<br><br> Plutarch distinctly asserts that Dionysus is Adonis. In proof of this he adduces the mitre worn by the Jewish high priest, his fawn-skin dress, the bells depending from it, the incarved thyrsus exhibited on parts of the prominent, elevated, structure facing the people.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: the bells on the rabbi's garb represent Bel, god of light. His origin is in the west. ([Here](https://infogalactic.com/info/Belenus) for more...)<br><br> **Pagan Origins** **(Dualism)**  <br>The Jewish philosophy rested on the doctrine of spirit and matter - the basis of the entire oriental philosophy from the Nile to India, including Assyria and Babylon.  <br>   <br>**Pre-Jewish Ruins**  <br>Under the Romans the Arabia beyond the Jordan was one of the most fertile and populous countries on earth. Not many years ago 446 ruined or deserted places were counted in the districts beyond the Jordan, Syria and the Holy Land.  <br>   <br>**Amorites**  <br>Hebron is at once a Hittite and an Amorite town; and Ezekiel declares (16:45) that the mother of Jerusalem was a Hittite and the father an Amorite.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The syllable _mor_ means "giant," as in the Irish Fomorians. A Morite was, therefore, probably a man of giant stature related to or identical with the Gheborim. Again, the etymology does not necessarily denote physical stature. The word "giant" might refer to eminence in other respects. ([Here](https://infogalactic.com/info/Fomorians) for more...)<br><br> **Hyksos**  <br>Josephus calls the Hyksos "Our Ancestors."  <br>   <br>…the object of Josephus, in his reply to Apion, was to identify his ancestors and ' Exodus ' with these very Hyksos who long held Lower Egypt.  <br>   <br>According to Deuteronomy 13:5 the Hebrews were thought to be the Hyksos, and Joseph expressly says so.  <br>   <br>I have always believed, on the strength of Numbers 13:22, that Manetho had traditional authority for his statement that Jerusalem was built by the Hyksos after their expulsion from Egypt and there is much to be said on behalf of the theory of Mariette and others that the leaders of the Hyksos were Hittites. However this may be, the discovery that Hittites and Amorites were associated in Northern Syria confirms the Biblical narrative which assigns a colony of Hittites to the south of Judah.  <br>   <br>The name Gazar or Gezer (1 Kings 9:16-17) may be added to Okhosath, to get at the root of the name Hukousos (the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings). The conjunction of the name Amalekites, Philistines, Geshuri, Gezeri, with Gath and the Egyptian Kesh, shows us who the Hyksos were and their primitive homes. whence they entered into Egypt. The Amalekites (1 Samuel 27:8) follow the names Geshuri and Gezeri.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Hyksos probably identical to the Biblical Amalekites.<br><br> It should not be difficult to detect the nationality of the Hyksos, for Manetho and Herodotus mention Phoenician and Philistine Shepherds.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Dunlop's connection between Hyksos with Phoenicians isn't far-fetched. More recent discoveries, of Minoan influences in Egypt, also support the Hyksos-Phoenician relation. For instance, Cretan (Minoan) artwork has been found in Egyptian cities first occupied and built by the Phoenicians. Academic historians are loath to publicize these findings. According to Scipio Africanus and other early historian, the Hyksos were undoubtedly Phoenicians. This is the view held by Comyns Beaumont and L. A. Waddell whose works have been deliberately suppressed by establishment historians.<br><br> Taylor speaks of the sharp Semitic profile of the Hyksos, while, according to Uhlemann, Hyksos and Israelites are represented alike on the monuments.  <br>   <br>…all the following dynasties to the twelfth (Shepherd dynasty) were kings of foreign origin but who had become completely established in Egypt.  <br>  <br>…the names of the Hyksos kings are both Egyptian and Semite. <br><br>- Note: The Eighteenth Dynasty is therefore to be regarded as _late_ in Egyptian history, when mixed-blooded rulers (such as the Tuthmoside kings) were common, some hostile to the Hyksos, others indifferent to presence - Mtsar<br><br> How could these Arabs or Phoenician Shepherds have got across the Nile without an invitation? We have to suppose that they had friends in the Delta who were hostile to the Memphite regime. The Shepherds held Lower Egypt. Africanus testifies that they were Phoenicians.  <br>   <br>The long contest between the Egyptians and Hyksos mentioned by Manetho occurred during the 17th dynasty from Amosis to Tuthmosis III. The former completely broke the foreign dominion and drove back the Hyksos to the northern part of the Delta; but it was Tuthmosis who first succeeded in sending them out of their last stronghold of refuge, Avaris.  <br>   <br>…the Jews were the martial Hyksos moving along the sea-shore road towards Palestine.  <br>   <br>Manetho specified the whole time of the residence of the Hyksos in Egypt, up to their departure from Avaris, to be 511 years.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Other scholars make it approximately 430 years, although some evidence indicates that the sojourn was only 100 years of so. In my opinion there were several interactions and conflicts. This is certainly the case, given that Ralph Ellis' research shows that the Hyksos were permanently ensconced in Lower Egypt. Moreover, they were not slaves but controllers and rulers. Their relatives and affiliates were dispersed in many neighboring lands - Canaan, Hebron, Palestine, Syria, Babylonia and further afield. Of course we are immediately skeptical of dates, numbers and general demographic details presented in the Bible, given that almost every account suffered from egregious mythmonger embellishment and elaboration over the years.<br><br> …it is allowable to fancy that the story of the Exodus is a work of the imagination, probably intended to change some accounts of the expulsion of the Hyksos driven out of Egypt, and to represent such events, if they ever occurred, as the Exodus of the Jews.  <br>   <br>Strabo says that, being a mixed population of Egyptians, Arabs and Phoenicians, the most correct report of those who are trusted in regard to the temple at Jerusalem exhibits the Egyptians as the ancestors of those now called Ioudeans (Jews).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Of course the Israelites (and Jews) and Hyksos were one and the same. This is the fact concealed for so long by historians, although Josephus and other ancient historians asserted this to be the case. Dunlop's work shows that the Palestine of the Jews was earlier frequented by the Hyksos and related tribes. When we then realize that there is no difference between Jews, Israelites and Hyksos, the problem of identification is solved.<br><br> He (Manetho) is quoted by Josephus as saying that the Hyksos established themselves in Judaea and built Jerusalem - SD  <br>   <br>**Setians**  <br>The Hebrew God bore the name El Sadi, Sadi, Set, Seth.  <br>   <br>Sada meant "fire." From Asad (or Asat) we derive Asatel, Setel, Sat, Set, Seth God of fire of Tyrians, Kananites, Kenites, Philistians and Egyptians, the God of the Hyksos-kings that the Egyptians feared as the Devil.  <br>   <br>It was as it looks to be, the name of the Canaanite fire-god of the Phoenician Sea, and the worshipers of Sad, Sed, Set, or Seth seem to have been known in Egypt at an early period as the Setou or Sheto. Here, then, we have the early status of the Palestine Ghebers at Ghebron and elsewhere as Sethites or the Children of Seth in the lands of the Dionysus-Adonis worshippers, extending themselves from Byblos down to Memphis in Egypt. <br><br>- Note: He makes the point that Set was worshiped by the Philistines. This may link to the Cretans and Hyksos. From their description it is obvious that they were Caucasians. Despised by the Jews, we are right to see them as identical with the Hyksos. The saga of the Hyksos in Egypt, and their conflicts with the Amenists, has been figuratively reprised by Biblical mythmongers. Stories such as that of David and Goliath, Cain and Abel, Moses and Pharaoh, Jesus vs. the Sanhedrin, etc, reprise the original saga officially refuted and denied.<br><br> The Hyksos entered Egypt as Setites (Sethians), but came out from Egypt as Asirians (Osirians).  <br>   <br>Set was worshiped in Philistia and the Delta. Set was Typhon; and Avaris was a Typhonian city. The ancients and chiefly the Egyptians held that the Jews worshiped Saturnus-Typhon (Set).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Avaris was a fortress city of the Hyksos. Akhenaton may have spent a great deal of his childhood in Avaris and other Hyksos-controlled cities such as Memphis and Mallewi. We get the word _avarice_, meaning greed, from this place name and its corrupt inhabitants.<br><br> In lower Egypt the worship of Seth was only in the Eastern Delta and perhaps in Memphis, Tanis and Avaris (at or near Pelusium) were two chief seats of his worship. In Tanis he had a great temple.  <br>  <br>Set was god of the Khita, of Memphis and Lower Egypt under the Hyksos.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The Delta region in Lower Egypt was controlled by the Hyksos. They probably had many allies among the priests of Heliopolis and Giza. Ralph Ellis believes the Hyksos were native Egyptians who invaded not from beyond the borders of Egypt but from Lower to Upper Egypt. In turn, their expulsion was not out of Egypt, but out of the upper provinces back to their habitats in Lower Egypt. This theory means that the Biblical saga of Abraham traveling to Egypt from Babylon is spurious and deliberately misleading. The Israelite patriarchs were Egyptian nobility from the outset. In my opinion, if any Israelites were captured and taken to Babylon and Assyria, they were the lower classes among the Hyksos horde.<br><br>  <br>According to Wiedemann, Set was adored in Egypt. The word Setim (Sheto) is the same as Sethim; and the Jews are Sethites. The Sabians derived their religion from Seth. Set (Seth) was worshiped in the land of the Sethim and all the way from the Nile to the Lebanon, by Hyksos, Jews, Philistines and Transjordans.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Sabian refers to star-watchers and astrologers.<br><br> The Sheto mentioned as adversaries of the Egyptians were the worshipers of Set; Set is the burning, destructive, solar force, the red Typhon.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This is monumental, since Jehovah or Yahweh is a composite of El Sadi or El Shaddai, the deity identical with the Egyptian Set. The characteristics of Jehovah are identical with those of Set. Moreover, the imagery presented by the mythmongers of the exiled Israelites walking through the desert to Mt. Sinai, and of Moses' meeting with Jehovah on the mountain, etc, is purely Setian.<br><br> Seth arranged the year, and means pillar.  <br>   <br>The Children of Seth set up two steles on which the science of astronomy was inscribed… The followers of Seth set up pillars in the Syriau land and were called in Egypt Shetha or Sheto. <br><br>- Note: Consider the two pillars or columns employed by Masons in their lodges and structures. On one level the two pillars represent the solstice points which do help demarcate the length of a year.<br><br> As evil demon, Set appears mostly as flame, and in the Ritual (Book of the Dead) as pursuer of souls. The deceased must have knowledge, must know the magic sentences, and perceive that he is identical with the Deity. Otherwise he falls under the power of the evil spirits and is subject to the new death.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: We might rightly speculate on how a god of darkness can appear as a flame, or as light of any kind. The paradox is resolved once we understand the occult underpinnings of solar worship as practiced by certain ancient groups such as the Setian-Atonists. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html) for more...)<br><br> **Corrupt But Intelligent**  <br>Then Apapi is no barbarian but an enlightened prince who has a college of hierogrammatei, sacred scribes, learned men. He is the only Shepherd King whose entire cartouche has come down to us…with this "Shepherd King" we come upon the finale of the oppression of Egypt.  <br>  <br>**Hieroglyphics Imported**  <br>…the Papyrus Sallier reveals that only the "Shepherd King" has a council of learned scribes, while the Theban's councilors are all military leaders. This is in itself evidence that the Egyptian hieroglyphic writing began in the North, and perhaps shows that this form of writing was imported from abroad. Waddell would say it was originally Sumerian, coming into Egypt before the first dynasty, at the time of Sargon and Menes. Massey would point to an even earlier time, when African tribes paid special attention to the sounds of animals and birds.  <br>   <br>**Bible Speaks of Hyksos Expulsion**  <br>And Abram went up out of Misraim (Egypt) and his wife and all (the people) that were his, and Lot with him, to the Negeb. And Abram was very powerful in cattle and silver and gold. And he went on his locomotions (departures) from Negeb to Beth El, to the place where his tent was at first, between Beth-El and Hail. (See Genesis 13:1-4)  <br>  <br>**Astronomy**  <br>Those Egyptian priests, says Lepsius, were versed in astronomy, but mysterious and far from communicative; it was only after the lapse of time, and by polite attentions, that they allowed themselves to be induced to communicate some of their doctrines: but still the most part was kept concealed.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Does this reference the Phoenicians or Luvians?<br><br> **Cain & Abel (Set vs. Horus)**  <br>Since the Egyptians admitted that their Osiris vs. Typhon myth formed part of their Mysteries, it is impossible for the Jews to deny that the very same myth, in the form of the Abel vs. Cain story, was a portion of the Mysteries of Jewish hidden wisdom. The saga of the rival twins is found the world over. See the stories of Sir Balan and Sir Balin and King Arthur vs. Mordred and King Mark, and others of this sort.  <br> **Chaldeans (Persians)**  <br>The region of the Chaldeans was the nurse of the ancient philosophy. The Mosaic philosophy is Chaldean.  <br>   <br>The Jews closely followed the Persians in their theory of the end of the world, and claimed kin with them.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The early Persian Chaldeans and Mithraists were undoubtedly related to the High Arya and the Druids of western climes. As far as I am concerned they are one and the same group, practicing identical rites. Later, after Mithraism was suppressed by Islam, their traditions became more Gnostic in complexion. I do not think the Druids and High Arya were essentially Gnostic. (See Volume One for more on the Chaldeans.)<br><br> **Phoenicians in Egypt**  <br>Also known as the Khetians and Kebriones. Known to Jews as the Gabor, near to Gheber - Mtsar  <br>   <br>The Hebrew and Phoenician languages are practically identical.  <br>   <br>The Hebrew language was Phoenician.  <br>  <br>The oldest traditions of the Hebrews were also preserved among the Phoenicians and the other peoples of the same race.  <br>   <br>It was an old Phoenician tradition that Saturn had granted the Land of the South to the God Taut, and Taut appears to have got a good share of it, even so far south as Egypt. The Phoenician Taut is the Egyptian Tat, Tot, Thoth.  <br>   <br>Kronos, therefore, whom the Phoenicians call Israel, king of the country, and afterwards after the end of his life sanctified into the star of Kronos, etc. In this myth what is Phoenician and what is Israelite are mixed up together, and the intent is to exhibit the descent of the Hebrews in the usual way from Saturn, who was regarded by the ancients as the Israelite Abraham, through etymological and historical combinations as they are current among the people.  <br>   <br>According to Dunlop, the Phoenicians placed two pillars in front of their temples., a custom adopted by the Egyptians – Mtsar  <br>   <br>**Phoenicians as Hyksos**  <br>Phoenician Shepherds entered Egypt - SD  <br>   <br>**Gods to Patriarchs**  <br>The Phoenicians and Hebrews euhemerized their gods into patriarchs.  <br>   <br>Abraham and Sarah are brother and sister, like Osiris and Isis.  <br>   <br>Sarah (or Asara) is a personification of Ashera, female consort of Jehovah, the “burning bush” of Mosaic lore - Mtsar <br><br>- Note: Abraham is figuratively Saturn, Seb or Set. As said earlier, the entire Exodus story was composed with Setian iconography. It has gone unnoticed by researchers. (The entrance of these people into Egypt is explained elsehwere.)<br><br> **The Real Adam**  <br>Tum's name would seem to have been given to the place named Atam in Exodus.  <br>   <br>Tum, like Adonis, was considered the "Greatest of Gods." Turn was styled 'the maker of men,' 'the Universal Lord,' 'the Creator God,' and 'the great Lord of created beings,' 'the producer of the gods.’  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Waddell would attribute this title to Adam-Thor, and also to Sargon the Great.<br><br> **Egyptian Influence**  <br>From the Assyrian and Babylonian religion we may infer in many particulars to Egyptian usages. Thus from the Hebrew, too, we may infer resemblances.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This is an understatement by Dunlop. Almost every scene and situation mentioned in the Old Testament, every personage, deity, custom and drama originates with the Egyptian Amenist tradition. Christians still say "Amen" at the end of prayers.<br><br> **Circumcision**  <br>It was the usage in the Egyptian Mysteries to circumcise the Initiated, and the Jews in Egypt could not bear the reproach of being uncircumcised. The Syrians of Palestine adopted this rite from Egypt.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Castration was demanded in goddess worship. The symbols of castration abound. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-1.html) for more...)<br><br> **The Technites**  <br>The Phoenician euphemerism disposed of Ptah and Adam…by mentioning Ptah under the name Technites (the Architect, Khnemu) and Adam under the names Geinos-Autochthon (earthy or sprung from the earth).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: From the Egyptian Ptah we derive Pater, Patron and Father. The name Peter (as in St. Peter) is also a derivation. The word Pope also originates in Ptah, the Artifex. Note that the Vatican is situated in St. Peter's (Ptah's) Square. Massey believes Ptah and his helpers to be the original Aleim or Elohim. In this aspect Ptah returns as Vulcan and Hephaestus of the Romans and Greeks. He is found in Ireland as Goibniu. ([Here](https://infogalactic.com/info/Goibniu) for more...)<br><br> **The International Magi**  <br>The Assyrian Chief priest Nergal Sarezar bore the name of his God Nergal Sarezar, and the Assyrians had, in common with the Persians and Babylonians, the Great Festival of Anaitis, also, like the Persians, the institution of the Magi which had come with the Chaldeans and Babylonians.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This critical concession supports the thesis that there were universal Druidic-Aryan colleges.<br><br>  <br>**Arabia**  <br>Of early Arabia we know but little except its worship of Saturn, Kronos, Dionysus and Aphrodite Ourania, and in the sketches of ancient Judea we are introduced to Adon (Iachoh) the Lebanon Life-god and to Ashera (the Syrian Venus), Sarah.  <br>   <br>**El (Hel)**  <br>The God El was the primal God of the Semite race known to the Hebrews as Hael (Hel), the Greek Aelios and Helios.  <br>   <br>In the Bible, El is a name of the Hebrew God. Movers held that the Highest God of all the Semites, El, was originally the same as the one worshiped by the Israelites. <br><br>- Note: El means “bright,” hence the solar symbolism. Same meaning for Elohim, Bel, Baal, Al, Allah, Abel, etc. It also means "messenger." (See Waddell.)<br><br> **Bel**  <br>Bel was regarded as the "Lord of the world who dost dwell in the temple of the sun" - (See Prof Sayce _Hibbert Lectures_)  <br>   <br>The Hebrews adored Bal (Mithra who rolls round the Wandering Planets) - the sun, moon, and the (five) planets. Consequently their symbolism placed a Gold Candlestick with seven lamps to indicate these Sabaoth (seven great ones).  <br>  <br>**High Places (Hills, Mounds, Monts)**  <br>Bel's temples were on the High Places.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The Hyksos, Phoenicians and other invaders of Egypt erected temples on raised areas. These were sacred to the goddess and it was her _son_ who ruled in her place from her chair. Asherah's son, by way of El Shaddai was Ba'al. ([Here](http://www.astrotheologyzone.com/the-ancient-canaanites.html) for more...)  <br>      <br>    <br><br>**Ashera**/Asherah  <br>Bel and Istar were among the Hebrews Bal and Astarta, Astarta too in Egypt. Ash (fire, life) becomes Asara, Azara, Ashera in Judaea and Phoenicia.  <br>  <br>The oldest symbols of Ashera were a tree, tree-trunk, unworked wood, a living tree, since in its green growth an instance of physical life was apparent.  <br>   <br>The Ashera, or some corresponding goddess in Persia, appears at times represented in oval shape.  <br>   <br>Manasseh set up a graven image of Ashera at Jerusalem.  <br>   <br>**Astarte**  <br>Astar meant a fire star, like aster in Greek; hence Astareta, Astarta, Ashtoret, Astarte. <br><br>- Note: similar to Taurt, Lady of the Khu or circumpolar stars. Like Isis, and many other eastern deities, Astarte may have a _western_ antetype. ([Here](https://infogalactic.com/info/%C4%92ostre) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**LionSymbolism**  <br>Like the horse, the lion represents the sun gods, as well solar worship.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: In most cases, the lion symbol denoted the son-lover of te goddess. He was her little "cub." This goes for the bull and tiger and serpent, etc.<br><br> The conjoined heads of 'lion and man' were represented on the veil of the temple of the Jews.  <br>   <br>**Book of the Dead**  <br>The chapters come mostly from Heliopolis, and secondly from Hermopolis. Only one chapter appears to originate from Thebes. It is thought that the Book and _Ritual_ predates the Amen Ra period, going back to the cult of Osiris - Mtsar  <br>   <br>**Babylon**  <br>The Tower of Bel at Babylon with its seven stages is duplicated in the Syrian and Hebrew-Gheber.  <br>   <br>The largest part of the Jews lived in Babylonia, where Bel-Mithra was worshiped.  <br>   <br>**Tetragrammaton**  <br>The Chaldeans had the mysterious Name Iao, the Jews had the unspeakable word Ihoh, the tetragramaton…and the Phoenicians had "trina littera" and the mysterious Name Iao, the Iao of the Chaldeans…the mysterious ineffable Name at Jerusalem, consisting of four letters, stands between the equally mysterious Iao on the Euphrates and the Iao of the Phoenicians.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The syllable Io or Iodh comes from the Irish for yew tree. This is also the origin of the term Jew. The Gaelic Iodah becomes Judah. The first letter "I" signifies the yew and becomes the first letter of the Tegrammaton - IHVH, of the name of Jehovah. The letter is commonly extended to Yod, which confirms its Irish origin. Jehovah was originally androgynous. His consort was Asherah, also symbolized by a tree. Asherah was excised by the rabbis, but continued to be worshiped in symbolic form, as the standing stone, tree, serpent or lion, etc. ([Here](http://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/etymology-key-to-the-past.htmlhttp://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/etymology-key-to-the-past.html) for more...)<br><br> **Orion**  <br>Orion-Sahou was consecrated to Osiris. Orion was the star of the "Three Kings" which arose to show the time and place of birth in heaven some 6,000 years ago, when the vernal equinox was in the sign of the Bull. (One can see Orion near to Gemini).  <br>   <br>Orion is the Mighty Hunter, closely connected with Hercules.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Waddell would have attributed Orion to Thor, the Gothic-Aryan patriarch and warrior.<br><br> **Seir**  <br>Meaning the sun, as in Mt. Seir, etc. Terms of respect, such as Sire, Sir, Sidar and Shah may derive from this.  <br>   <br>**Paradise**  <br>The Egyptian name for paradise is Aahlu or Aalu (also Aaru or Arru). For Massey this referred to the circumpolar region of everlasting stars - Mtsar  <br>   <br>**Number 7**  <br>The sacred number 7 was everywhere from the Euphrates to the Nile.  <br>   <br>Egyptians believed that paradise is an island surrounded by a holy stream.  <br>   <br>He (God) is many times called Sabaoth as the one who is over the Seven Orbits, that is the Creator.  <br>  <br>**Baptism**  <br>Baptism was one of the observances in the worship of Adonis in Mesopotamia and Arabia. Those initiated in the Mysteries of Mithra were baptized.  <br>   <br>**Christianity & Mithraism**  <br>The change to the Christian religion seems to have been helped on by the ideas previously taught in the Mysteries, and more or less taken up by the Jews and others. The Dionysus Mysteries were a concurrent factor in producing that mental status that predisposed minds towards the Resurrection theory and Christian sentiment.  <br>   <br>**Chaldean Evangelists**  <br>The Evangel according to the Hebrews was written in the Chaldean and Syrian language, but in Hebrew letters. It was, then, Chaldaean in form, origin and doctrine.  <br>   <br>**Nasoreans, Iesseans or Jessians (Proto-Christians)**  <br>Was there a sect of the Nazoria called Iesseans (as Epiphanius says). Matthew says many things to confirm Epiphanius in this particular. Matthew describes them as Essenes.  <br>   <br>The Babylonian and Jewish Kabalah preceded the Christianism of the gospels. The gnosis was Hindu, Persian, Babylonian and included the Egyptian gnosis as exemplified in the writings of Hermes Trismegistus, the Jewish gnosis, and whatever of these was infused into individual Sabians, Nazoria and Ebionim.  <br>   <br>**Epiphanius**  <br>…tells us that the Nazorenes were before Christ, and knew not Christ: and what is said of the Nazoria in the desert is equally true of the Ebionites, for they lived together and the two names are names of the Transjordan and Nabathaean Ascetics. These were their distinguishing designations, when, under the Baptism of John, the command came to 'Go out from the Great Desert.' If these Nazoria had not gone out to Antioch where they first learned to be called Christians, we might to-day have to look in vain for the pope of Rome and the Church of England.  <br>   <br>**Origin of Nasorean**  <br>The word Asaia (physician) is the root of the word Iessaia (healers), and the words zar and nazar are the root of Nazoria (Nazarenes) meaning self-denial, abstinence.  <br>   <br>**The Moses Fraud**  <br>The divine Sekra wrote with his finger upon a stone 42 questions for Budha. Ten tablets of stone were also written by the finger of Alahim.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: We see from this that the Muslim _Allah_ derives in part from Alahim or Elohim.<br><br> **Suppression of the Pharisees**  <br>…we must remember that the heavy hand that had crushed Jerusalem had in some degree deprived the Pharisees of power. If Jerusalem had not been destroyed, who among the Jews would have ventured to write that the Pharisees, the proudest sect and the most powerful, were a generation of vipers? To take the religion of the Initiated out of their hands, to combine it with Persian and Essene doctrines, to connect it with a man, and to preach it to the uninitiated and the poor, this was to originate a Christianity.  <br>   <br>**The Jews**  <br>Siva is the only Hindu deity to whom animal sacrifices were offered. They were offered to Osiris, Dionysus-Iachoh and the Jewish Moloch, for the Jewish religion is the Dionysus-Mithra worship, with its baptism, purifications and lustrations.  <br>   <br>**Jacob**  <br>Son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham, his name was changed by Jehovah to _Israel_. The word Jacob means “deceitful,” “crafty” or “sly.” No kidding. The mythmongers knew what they were doing with their texts. Israel as it appears as person and place is indeed the product of scribal chicanery - Mtsar  <br>  <br>**Heavenly Sea**  <br>The Egyptians considered the heaven a vast sea, as in Genesis 1:6. The sun goes through the heaven in a bark, of which he occupies the centre. The celestial sea which environs all parts of our universe has been the theatre of the first divine manifestations. <br><br>- Note: Consider the arrival of the Tuatha de Danann.<br><br> **Physical Sea**  <br>The Egyptian priests abominated the sea and called salt the froth of Typhon (Set).  <br>   <br>**Fertile Lands**  <br>The whole desert region between Palestine and Egypt was once far more productive than now and could support a considerable population.  <br>   <br>Once the valley of the Jordan was a series of lakes, and the Dead Sea of far greater extent than now.  <br>   <br>The climate of ancient Palestine was always of varied character owing to the variation of level in different spots, but its hills and mountains, together with the wooded character of the country at an early period, must have made most of it a tolerable abode for man.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Beaumont refutes this, saying that the area was _not_ clement enough for the elements of civilization to have originated there. Transported there, yes, but nothing more. ([Here](https://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/comyns-beaumont-2.html) for more...)<br><br> **The Major Arcana**  <br>the Dog is leader of souls, Hermes _kunokephalos_, the psychagogos, when he carries them into the hemisphere of light; psychopompos when he leads them in the other solstice or Equinox (Libra) into the dark hemisphere.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: An old name for dog was _cur_ or _kur_, which was also the name of Syria. The Kurians or Kurites were Phoenician-Goths, who had many ports and territories in Norther Syria. The symbol adopted for Phoenician merchants was the dog. It's possible that the term for priest, _cure_, derives from this. The name mercury, denoting the god of _merchants_, contains the syllable _cur_. _Mer_ = merchantile mariners, _Cur_ = Syrian-Goth-Pheonicians.<br><br> **The Thirteenth Sign**  <br>…the constellation Serpentarius…who ascends at the same time as Libra. The name of this serpent, the serpent of Eve, as it is still called by the Persians, Heva, as it is called in the Arabian spheres, has been preserved.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: It has been preserved but in adulterated form. Other signs of the zodiac were artfully _masculanized_ for deceptive purposes. The Major Arcana of the Tarot preserves the _feminine_ symbolism originally associated with both Sagittarius and Serpentarius, lost to astrology. Galactic Center is also to be found in this celestial region.|---|
