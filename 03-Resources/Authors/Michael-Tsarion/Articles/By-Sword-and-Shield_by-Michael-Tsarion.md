| _William, archbishop of Tyre, had regarded the Templars and Hospitallers as a force for disintegration and lawlessness in the kingdom...he saw that by his day they had become too rich and proud, refusing to obey the authorities over them_ - Helen Nicholson (_The Knights Templar: A New History_) |

| As I've shown previously, in 1312, after the Knights Templar were officially suppressed and disbanded, their order was secretly maintained and reorganized by their many loyal Clerics or Exxons. These highly competent and literate deputies have remained in charge of the Templar network since the fourteenth century. For hundreds of years they have successfully infiltrated and established numerous media companies, financial conglomerates, charities, newspapers and magazines, publishing houses, banks, insurance companies and educational edifices. They have also established numerous powerful satellite orders, such as the Illuminati, Jesuits, Sabbateans, Frankists, Rosicrucians, Martinists, Grand Orient Masons, Scottish Rite Masons, Shriners, Opus Dei, Skull and Bones Society, etc.  <br>  <br>It is true to say that the Templar-Exxons constitute a powerful super-active secret society in their own right, one never before presumed to exist. It is, therefore, imperative that we become familiar with their main insignias and emblems -  the compass and rule, letter G, red and white crosses, red square, cross and crown, truncated pyramid, caduceus, serpent, double-headed eagle, double-cross, skull and bones, lion, unicorn and shield, etc.  <br>  <br>As to their intention toward humanity, it's made abundantly clear from their own sinister motto, which in Latin reads _In Hoc Signo Vinces_ (_In This Sign Conquer_). |

|---|The chief symbol denoting the Exxons is the Double Cross of Lorraine. Here it is displayed on a medieval Exxon, a serving man who executes the will of the royals, in much the same way as a Page.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|The term "double-crossed" means we've been artfully swindled, waylaid or betrayed. Well, the Exxons are exactly that - betrayers. For them the world is, literally, "not enough," and by hook or by crook they intend sacrificing everyone on the planet to their dark gods.  <br>  <br>The double cross, signifying the Exxons, is often displayed by Masons in the following way:|---|

|---|The double-cross motif is often displayed in a subtle manner, thusly:|

|   |   |   |

|---|The double-cross also appears cryptically in corporate logos such as the following:|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|Another emblem employed by the Templar-Exxons is the double-headed eagle, usually featuring the motto: _Ordo Ab Chao_ or "Order Out of Chaos." Translating the motto isn't difficult. They create the chaos and then install the order.|---|

|---|The Templars and their associated orders were not only involved in military activities. The Knights of Malta, for example, were originally known as the Knights Hospitaller, and were accomplished apothecaries. Suggestively, the humanitarian Red Cross organization bears the colors of the Templars, a red cross on white field. The Nazis did likewise. No surprise, then, that Hitler (the "Jesuit from Munich") was financed, supported and directed by the Knights of Malta, and later put on the cover of Time Magazine as a celebrated "Man of the Year," by its owner Henry Luce - a Knight of Malta. Hitler's infamous book _Mein Kampf_ was actually written by the Jesuit priest Bernhard Stempfle. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Papen) & [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Stempfle) for more...)|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|The Knights of Malta are the foremost branch of Templar-Exxons. Chronologically they are an earlier order, formed in 1060 AD, and were originally known as the Knights Hospitaller and Knights of Rhodes. The order's full title was/is _The Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem._ Their veneration of John the Baptist indicates that they are Gnostics. As shown previously, they are members of the infamous Nazarenes or Fourth Sect, serving as the bodyguard and army of the latter. Although their present headquarters is in Rome, near Vatican City, they are not to be considered Roman Catholics. Indeed, their leader is the "Black Pope" who secretly governs the publicly acknowledged pope.|---|

|---|The previous Pope Benedict with his boss, Andrew Bertie, head of the Knights of Malta. Bertie was blood-related to Queen Elizabeth II of England, who commands the Venerable Order of St. John, the Protestant branch of the Knights of Malta. These men control the minds and hearts of millions of Christian simpletons all over the world, with no idea about what goes on behind closed doors. The research and warnings of whistle-blowing insiders such as Baron Avro Manhattan, Father Alberto Rivera, Father Malachi Martin, and others, go unheard by the moronic masses content to be ruled by despots. The Knights of Malta sit at the United Nations as a sovereign nation, enjoying complete immunity from prosecution. Indeed, this order _writes_ the laws of nations. Some of the most prominent men in America are members of the SMOM or _Sovereign Military Order of Malta_. ([Here](https://unslaved.com/brotherhood-of-death/) for more...)|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|Establishing their order in Jerusalem prior to the Templars put the Hospitallers in touch with several super-wealthy groups, most importantly the Gaonim, Nazarenes, House of Edessa, Cilician Pirates and Merks (Italian Merchants). The latter coterie still exists and have long since merged with the Knights of Malta, hence the latter's presence in Rome. The Caduceus was and is one of the main symbols of the super-wealthy Italian Merchants, also known as the Fondi.  <br>  <br>It is likely that the Templars adopted the skull and bones insignia from their brothers-in-arms, the Cilician Pirates. Indeed, without the substantial financial assistance of these European and Middle-Eastern secret societies, there was no way for the Hospitallers and Templars to have launched the first Crusade and thereafter placed their kings on the throne of Jerusalem.|---|

|---|A Templar and Hospitaller wearing their chivalric colors and crosses. The attire and insignias were deliberately designed as opposites or, more correctly, _inversions_. The Knights of Malta also use a white cross on a black field, as seen above. Their white cross on red is identical to the flag of Switzerland, one of the most prominent Masonic bastions. It's also found on the Red Cross organization.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|The flags of the Knights Templar beside that of the Hospitallers or Knights of Malta. The inversion confirms that the latter serve as Exxons of the former. The red field seen on the flag of the Order of Malta was inherited from the Cilician Pirates. A piratical warning sign, it signifies extreme danger of violent attack and confiscation, as does the crossed swords motif seen on masonic emblems, such as that of the Scottish Rite. It is also the color of the warlike god Set. ([Here](http://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/chapter-forty-one.html) for more...)|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|Another fairly common symbol indicating the Exxons is the _shield_. This is because, after all, the Exxons have "shielded" their Templar overlords for centuries.  <br>  <br>It is particularly the case with the Rothschild (or Red Shield) dynasty, whose family emblem _is_ a red shield. Not surprisingly, several high-ranking members of the Rothschild banking family are Knights of Malta, which means they are certainly Exxons servicing the Templar empire.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|When Mayer Amschel Bauer chose the emblem of a red shield (_Roth-schild_) to put outside his money-lending business, in Frankfurt-on-Main, he deliberately signified his status as an Exxon and Hofjuden or "Court Jew," placed in that position by more elusive Clerics also in service to the Templars and Order of Sion. It is, therefore, not surprising that several members of his family were Knights of Malta.  <br>  <br>_Aware that the Rothschilds are an important Jewish family, I looked them up in Encyclopedia Judaica and discovered that they bear the title “Guardians of the Vatican Treasury”…The appointment of Rothschild gave the black papacy absolute financial power and secrecy. Who would ever search a family of orthodox Jews for the key to the wealth of the Roman Catholic Church?_ - F.  T. Saussy (_Rulers of Evil_)|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|As to the baneful influence of the Jesuits, a single statement is all we require to know what's what. French historian Edgar Quinet said of them: _Wherever a dynasty dies, I can see, rising up and standing behind her, a kind of bad genie, one of those dark figures that are the confessors, gently and paternally luring her towards death._ So it is with Exxons of every type, in every land.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|The devilish Jesuits or Society of Jesus was formed by Templar-Exxons as part of their plan to undermine their ancient enemy, the Fifth Sect of Papal Christianity. Their agent was psychopath Ignatius Loyola who established the Jesuit Order in 1534, in a church dedicated to  Mary - the Notre Dame de Montmarte. Posing and acting as extremist Catholics, they successfully duped and finally undermined the Papacy. The gradual subversion of the hardline Papacy took place in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Like their Templar masters and Fourth Sect of Nazarenes, the Jesuits were and are politically left of center. They and other neo-Templar organizations have used their great wealth and influence to spread Socialism throughout the world for hundreds of years. As several scholars have established beyond all doubt, Nazism was a Jesuit concoction, a fact openly admitted by Franz von Papen, Knight of Malta and Nazi ambassador to the Vatican, _acquitted_ at the Nuremberg trials, of course. ([Here](http://www.michaeltsarion.com/the-red-papacy.html) for more...)  <br>  <br>_The Third Reich is the first world power which not only acknowledges but also puts into practice the high principles of the papacy_ - Franz von Papen  <br>  <br>_I can see Himmler as our Ignatius of Loyola_ - Adolf Hitler  <br>  <br>..._within the SS Central Security Service, an organization was created, and most of its main posts were held by Catholic priests wearing the black uniform of the SS. The Jesuit Father Himmler was one of its superior officers_ - Edmund Paris (_History of the Jesuits_)|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|Sadly, for ordinary people the Templar presence is a factor in British and American law. The Templars wore under-garments made of sheep wool, which they _never_ removed even when bathing. This is why magistrates wear wigs made of wool, to signify their allegiance with the Templars, and that they too are Exxons. English barristers work from Temple Bar and the Inns of Court which are both major bastions of the Knights Templar in London. One goes to court to be "fleeced" of earnings. All for the benefit of Templar-Exxon bankers. It's _their_ rules you're breaking. Their time with the Cilician Pirates, who dominated the Mediterranean, and many islands therein, taught the Templars all they needed to know about lucrative maritime law which they subsequently imposed on the unfortunate nations under their hex.

|---|---|---|
|---|The emblem of British Intelligence (MI5) is highly suggestive. It is obviously masonic. In the 1950s the head of this secretive organization was none other than John Alexander Sinclair, of the infamous Templar dynasty, members of which fled from Europe to Scotland during and after the 14th century. Note the masonic All-Seeing-Eye, Maltese Crosses and Fleur-du-lis of the Order of Sion. The policy of this and other surveillance services is to seek out and destroy anyone posing a threat to the Exxons and their nefarious network.

## BEWARE THE SHIELD

|---|_...the Founding Fathers and the bevy of helpers who gave us the Seal were the most ardent students of the inner spirit behind heraldry. This interest in a higher symbolism was reflected in the national Seal, and - by extension - the dollar bill_ - David Ovason|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|The Great Seal on the one dollar bill we know today was re-designed from earlier versions on the orders of senior Freemasons Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Henry Wallace and Henry Morganthau, all Exxons holding the three top positions in government.  <br>  <br>The seal rightly displays the stars and stripes denoting the United States. However, it also features a _shield_, a motif incorporated as early as 1782. Why was this particular symbol chosen and what does it signify? From what I present here, we see that it represents the mighty Templar-Exxons whose rule has overshadowed the U.S. from the beginning. ([Here](https://unslaved.com/the-masonic-founding-of-america/) for more...)  <br>  <br>The first design for the Great Seal, of 1782, featured the number 13, which is associated with the Templars, being the _day_ Jacques de Molay, grand master of the Templars, was executed in 1314. The number may also refer to the number of Templars executed by the authorities on the orders of King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V.  <br>  <br>The earlier seal of 1782 featured a phoenix-like bird with sixteen-leaved olive sprig and thirteen arrows. Possibly the former represented the Order of Sion and the latter the Templars.  <br>  <br>The revised seal of 1885 featured thirteen leaves on the olive sprig and a similar number of arrows. There were _nine_ tail-feathers representing the nine original Templar knights who formed the order in Jerusalem during the first Crusade.  <br>  <br>Very often, shields represent the chivalric or knightly orders dominating the nations of the earth from behind the scenes:|---|

|---|It's all concealed in plain sight. Everyone notices the striking central image of the ram's head, without ever paying attention to the shield that makes this a _heraldic_ device.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|Note the upper right symbol. Not only do we see the blue shield, but also the s0-called Caduceus of Hermes or Mercury, wing-footed messenger of the gods. It is the origin of the well-known dollar sign ($). A Caduceus is to be found emblazoned on the portal of the Bank of England. Suggestively, a Caduceus is also seen in the hands of a _goddess_ on the portal of the Federal Reserve building in Washington DC. Mercury was also the god of _merchants,_ known in ancient times as the Mer or Merks. Note the name AMERICA, named after the money-men who financed its "founding." The syllable also turns up in the name MEROVINGIAN, hardly surprisingly since this was the dynasty to which the leaders and monarchs of the Knights Templar belonged. The Merovingians claimed to be the _Sang-rael_ - the holy royal bloodline descended from Mary Magdalene and Jesus. The syllable _cur_ in Mercury, signifies a dog. Mercury was styled with a dog's head, as Hermanubis, clearly derived from the Egyptian dog-headed god entitled "Opener of the Ways." ([Here](https://www.google.com/search?q=hermanubis&client=firefox-b-d&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwirxcyKurbwAhVsQRUIHSvvA7MQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=897&bih=407) for more...)|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|This Old Testament symbol nearly made it onto the dollar bill, and it's this serpentine shape that is preserved as the dollar sign - $. Indeed, the word Dollar comes from the German word _Thaler_. On one side of an old thaler we see what resembles a Mercurial Caduceus. This time the symbol does not denote medicine. Rather, it is the old insignia of the Merchants or original money-men. The Mer or Merks were a conglomerate of powerful men from various chivalric orders established by the Templar-Exxons. Although many "Jews" belong, they did not _create_ the network of banks, money-lending agencies, hospitals, medical centers and pharmaceutical orgs. A few prominent Jewish families have enjoyed a "tassel to purse" relationship with the more elusive Templars and Italian Merchants. The Rothschilds, Oppenheimers, Warburgs,  Schiffs, etc, are simply obedient Exxons carrying out the instructions of their illustrious overlords.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|The Knights of Columbus are another wealthy and powerful American order of Exxons. The term Columbus (from _colombe_) relates not to a person but to a dove, symbol of the "Davids" or Commanders of Aton. Note the shield on their emblem. Many other Masonic flags feature this heraldic device denoting chivalric orders such as the Templars. Note the colors red and white, also symbolizing the Templars. Note also the fascii representing Fascism or, better said, _Socialism_. The sword symbolizes might over right, military action and violent suppression, while the anchor  alludes to the old Cilician Pirates whose contributions - piracy, extortion, offshore banking, maritime law, etc - allowed their fellow orgs to seize world power. The Skull and Bones Society is the American branch of this particular secret cabal. They still fly the Jolly Roger, sign of the ancient pirates, who bear no resemblance whatsoever to the daring swashbucklers of ludicrously deceptive Hollywood extravaganzas. In piracy, a red flag signaled imminent danger. It demanded a vessel or person heave to and open all coffers and purses for violent confiscation. No surprise then that a symbol commonly used by the Knights of Columbus is that of a skull and bones, as first used by Templars and pirates.|---|

|---|Concerning overt Templar symbolism in America, let us not forget that the White House, in Washington DC, is architecturally a carbon copy of the Knights Templar _headquarters_ in Dublin Ireland, known as Leinster House, built by freemason James Hoban, and completed in 1748. Clearly, as some scholars reluctantly concede, the Templar order was alive and well centuries after its supposed suppression. The Templars fled not only to Scotland but to Ireland. Their brother order, the Cistercians, were prominent in Ireland from an early period, and many of the most senior Merovingian kings and nobles studied in Ireland under highly literate Culdean and Cistercian monks there. One even married an Irish princess.  <br>  <br>As I show, Godfroi de Bouillon's original group of Crusaders were called Knights of the Notre Dame de Sion (Knights of Our Lady of Sion), with the site of their formation in Jerusalem known as the "Mother of all Churches." This female symbolism was not chosen by accident, and is not incidental. The Templars are, in fact, the military wing and male branch of a far more elusive _female_ order, known as the Order of Sion or Priory of Sion. The term _knight_ means "servant."  <br>  <br>The world still has to accept this fact. Nevertheless, when one possesses the correct keys of decipherment, the symbolism confirms my point.|---|

The horse remains the logo of the many equestrian orders established by the Exxons. Livery companies also proliferate to provide intelligent, obedient recruits selected and hired to run the Templar's worldwide empire.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|One of the Order of Sion's chief symbols is the _single eye_ - known to freemasons as the Eye of Providence. Interesting, then, that it is prominently displayed on the one dollar note:|---|

|---|The American freemasons decided to feature a truncated pyramid on the Great Seal as early as 1782. The strange symbol had been used before this date by various revolutionary and occult societies, mostly to denote a project or work "unfinished."  <br>  <br>As shown in my Female Illuminati program, the pyramid and eye are _both_ female symbols, as is most of the iconography in Masonry. Scholars are yet to recognize what exists in plain view. Here's another striking example of the _female symbolism_ commonly employed by the forces behind the American system:|---|

|---|The name of the goddess Isis in hieroglyphs is made from three familiar signs, the semi-circle, obelisk and star, exactly what we find in stone in Washington DC, in the form of the Oval Office, Washington Monument and Pentagon. Visited by millions of tourists, most of whom have no idea that the entire city was precisely laid out by freemasons to align with the star Sirius, the so-called "Dog Star," sacred to Isis. Many other symbols - such as the boat or ship and seat or throne - are assigned to this goddess. ([Here](https://unslaved.com/female-illuminati-program/) for more...)|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|We must not make the common mistake of thinking that the single eye represents God, Osiris, Horus, Jehovah, or any male figure. Author David Ovason believes it was mason Benjamin Franklin who commissioned the eye and pyramid motif, and accepted the design offered by Swiss artist Du Simitiere. The artist's first draft, changed later, was of a _left_ eye, representing "sinister" as well as occult forces and intentions. (It also represents the moon and _female_ sacerdotal rites.) This is not surprising when we remember that Franklin was a member of the Hellfire Club, a group of homosexual and pedophile aristocrats with many secretive lodges throughout the world. What we know as Shriners, Born-Again Christians, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Quakers, Odd Fellows, and so on, are merely fronts for these deviant hedonic orgiastic anal-sadists.  <br>  <br>The pyramid on the dollar bill has 13 levels, perhaps representing Jacques de Molay who, on the day of his execution, levied a cursed upon his enemies, not to mention the whole world. It may signify the thirteen martyred knights who also perished during the rout. Or it may connote the _thirteenth_ sign of the esoteric zodiac, known as the Serpent Bearer, and sacred to secret societies.  <br>  <br>The American De Molay Society still exists, and focuses on the recruitment of youngsters.|---|

|---|The Shriners are high degree freemasons, closely associated with Scottish Rite masons. They operate many charities for the welfare of children. Among their symbols are the Turkish Fez and Arabic Scimitar. The order's full name is  the _Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine._ Many of America's most wealthy and prominent personalities are members of this order. Their main emblem features the face of Pharaoh Akhenaton, prince of light and monarch of the Setian-Atonists. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriners) for more...)|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|The main Shriner emblem also features a five-pointed star, which as we've seen represents the goddess Isis. It also features what appears to be an inverted crescent moon. Actually, it is the sign of the planet Venus, also known as _Lucifer._ Venus was, from the dawn of time, the heavenly body revered by sacerdotal women, given that it rises _before_ the sun.  <br>  <br>Other important occult secrets are to be found on the dollar bill. For example the single word "ONE" cryptically alludes to the ancient city of Heliopolis, near the Great Pyramids, seat of the ancient priesthood of the sun.  <br>  <br>The city was originally known as An or On, meaning "light." The Greeks changed the name to Heliopolis, meaning "city of the sun." In the city stood great mystery schools and temples dedicated to the solar deity Ra, the "Silent One."|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|Near the Great Pyramid stood the great Egyptian city of light. You think you read ONE, when your subconscious reads ON, meaning "light." It's a matter of solar priesthoods and the peculiar form of worship they're involved with _behind_ a front of light. Like the obelisk and pyramid, the numeral 1 is ithyphallic. However, on the female side, the word is akin to YONI, signifying the vagina and womb. Indeed, the word _money_ comes from the ancient temple of Moneta in Rome, dedicated to the great goddess Juno. Furthermore, there are thirteen instances of the number 13 to be found on this reverse side of the bill, 13 being a lunar (or female) number. Thirteen also represents the _esoteric_ stellar zodiac, featuring the thirteenth sign of Ophiuchus or Serpent-Bearer. Significantly, in this regard, the symbol of the eagle (as Aquila) alludes to the sign of Scorpio which "opens the way" to the dark 13th sign. In any case, the eagle's iconographic antetype, the vulture, denoted the _earliest_ goddess in ancient Egyptian history. The eagle's spreaded wings represent "empire," as seen in ancient Egyptian and Roman state iconography. In 1782, the chief artist of the Great Seal, William Barton, suggested (and drew) a phoenix as the chief symbol of America. This mythological bird represents vast astrological cycles and epochs. A fascii which was to appear on the dollar bill was transposed to the dime instead. It also appears prominently in the Lincoln Memorial and Congress Room.|---|

|---|Two golden fascii in the U.S. Congress Room. Note their "dollar sign" (or Caduceus) shape, symbolizing the Merks. Note the colors of the stripes on the American flag - red and white - colors of the Knights Templar and Knights of Malta. _Just coincidence, nothing to worry about._|---|

|---|Since the advent of modern media, decades ago, we've been warned about secret society intrigue over and over again. Lately, Dan Brown's fictional writings have been the rage, with millions of books sold and big budget extravaganzas made by Hollywood to further popularize the controversial subject-matter. Yet the world remains in the clutches of inhuman despots whose acts of extortion, confiscation and outright piracy continue unabated. Do these sick demagogues really have anything to fear from a herd of compliant ignoramuses? Not as far as I'm concerned.  <br>  <br>So what is it about humans that prevents them _acting_ on the facts presented here? What allows them to accept the truth only when it's presented softly in fictional form? Given that we regard ourselves as highly civilized and advanced, why has our propensity for reality-distortion not been sanely addressed and investigated? If we can suspend disbelief and accept fictional renderings about vital matters, why can we not, with less energy wastage, boldly face dreadful facts head on, in the clear light of day? Why is it so difficult to realize that by not acting, and remaining in willful denial, we become our own enslavers?|---|
