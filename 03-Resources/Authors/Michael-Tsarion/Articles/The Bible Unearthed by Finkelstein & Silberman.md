|---|**Jerusalem**  <br>The historical core of the Bible was born in the bustle of the crowded streets of Jerusalem, in the courts of the royal palace of the Davidic dynasty, and in the Temple of the God of Israel.  <br>  <br>How tiny their royal city would have appeared to a modern observer!...Its cities and population were minuscule in comparison to those of the neighboring empires of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Likewise, its material culture was poor in comparison to the splendor and extravagance of theirs.  <br>  <br>**Confessions & Concessions**  <br>...it is now evident that many events of biblical history did not take place in either the particular era or the manner described. Some of the most famous events in the Bible clearly never happened at all.  <br>  <br>When we speak of the Bible we are referring primarily to the collection of ancient writings long known as the Old Testament - now commonly referred to by scholars as the Hebrew Bible. It is a collection of legend, law, poetry, prophecy, philosophy, and history, written almost entirely in Hebrew (with a few passages in a variant Semitic dialect called Aramaic.  <br>  <br>**Torah & its Divisions**  <br>The Torah - also known as the Five Books of Moses, or the Pentateuch (“ five books” in Greek) - includes Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.  <br>  <br>The next division, the _Prophets_, is divided into two main groups of scriptures. The Former Prophets - Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings - tell the story of the people of Israel from their crossing of the river Jordan and conquest of Canaan, through the rise and fall of the Israelite kingdoms, to their defeat and exile at the hands of the Assyrians and Babylonians.  <br>  <br>Finally, the _Writings_ are a collection of homilies, poems, prayers, proverbs, and psalms that represent the most memorable and powerful expressions of the devotion of the ordinary Israelite at times of joy, crisis, worship, and personal reflection.  <br>  <br>**Origins of the Twelve Tribes**  <br>Jacob - the third-generation patriarch - who became the father of twelve distinct tribes.  <br>  <br>The Bible relates how Jacob’s twelve sons fought among one another, worked together, and eventually left their homeland to seek shelter in Egypt at the time of a great famine.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: As shown in other pages, the holy people were at each other's throats from the beginning, selling each other out, lying, cheating, raving, murdering, and worse - Mtsar<br><br>  <br>**The Two Kingdoms**  <br>For the next two hundred years, the people of Israel lived in two separate kingdoms, reportedly succumbing again and again to the lure of foreign deities.  <br>  <br>**Kingdom of Israel**  <br>The leaders of the northern kingdom are described in the Bible as all irretrievably sinful; some of the kings of Judah are also said to have strayed from the path of total devotion to God.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Again, we note that conflict was the order of the day. Yahweh is unhappy with the Israelites, deeming them sinful and unsuitable.<br><br>  <br>**Punishment**  <br>In time, God sent outside invaders and oppressors to punish the people of Israel for their sins. First the Arameans of Syria harassed the kingdom of Israel.  <br>  <br>Then the mighty Assyrian empire brought unprecedented devastation to the cities of the northern kingdom and the bitter fate of destruction and exile in 720 BCE for a significant portion of the ten tribes. The kingdom of Judah survived more than a century longer, but its people could not avert the inevitable judgment of God. In 586 BCE, the rising, brutal Babylonian empire decimated the land of Israel and put Jerusalem and its Temple to the torch.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So Yahweh is a god of wrath, ready to severely punish those who disobey him in any way. It's a case of "do as I say, or else!"<br><br>  <br>**Second Temple**  <br>after the return of some of the exiles to Jerusalem and the reconstruction of the Temple, Israel would no longer be a monarchy but a religious community, guided by divine law and dedicated to the precise fulfillment of the rituals prescribed in the community’s sacred texts.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So Yahweh's first experiment clearly failed. That's odd. Nevertheless, after the construction of the second temple it's the priests who solely rule over the chosen. They become a monarchy in their own right, more oppressive and severe than any normal rule by royals and nobles.<br><br>  <br>_The whole book of Leviticus is concerned with the clergy's power and control over the nation's worship, and the great material and financial benefits they could derive from such_ -  R. A. Anderson  <br>  <br>_...the temple in Jerusalem was to be the only legitimate sanctuary of Jahveh and it was to be served only by the Zadokite, or hereditary priests. Thus, by one sudden, shrewd maneuver, the authority of the priests was greatly established. Local shrines were declared illegal, pagan cults and practices were outlawed, a line of social demarcation was drawn between the Jews and their pagan neighbors and the ground was prepared for a sweeping reformation_ - Ernest Busenbark  <br>  <br>**Editing & Doctoring**  <br>...incongruities soon became apparent: the biblical text was filled with literary asides, explaining the ancient names of certain places and frequently noting that the evidences of famous biblical events were still visible “to this day.” These factors convinced some seventeenth century scholars that the Bible’s first five books, at least, had been shaped, expanded, and embellished by later, anonymous editors and revisers over the centuries.  <br>  <br>_William De Wette contended that the reason certain laws in Deuteronomy contradict laws in other Books of the Pentateuch is because Deuteronomy was written at a later time, to meet conditions which had not existed when the other Books were written. But, in his effort to disprove the Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy, he failed to observe that there was just as much reason to doubt the authenticity of all the other so-called Books of Moses_ - Ernest Busenbark  <br>  <br>**Books of Moses?**  <br>By the late eighteenth century and even more so in the nineteenth, many critical biblical scholars had begun to doubt that Moses had any hand in the writing of the Bible whatsoever; they had come to believe that the Bible was the work of later writers exclusively. These scholars pointed to what appeared to be different versions of the same stories within the books of the Pentateuch, **suggesting that the biblical text was the product of several recognizable hands.**  <br>  <br>**In the last few decades scholarly opinions about the dates and authorship of these individual sources have varied wildly.**  <br>  <br>...others insist that they were late compositions, collected and edited by priests and scribes during the Babylonian exile and the restoration.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Right, but what's not investigated to any depth is whether the Old Testament books contain actual historical events or simply well-devised _stories_ that cannot be wholly and strongly supported by evidence.<br><br>  <br>...all agree that the Pentateuch is not a single, seamless composition but a patchwork of different sources, each written under different historical circumstances to express different religious or political viewpoints.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: In other words, its a largely fictional work compiled by different sects and priesthoods.<br><br>  <br>Some scholars argue that it was compiled during the exile in an attempt to preserve the history, culture, and identity of the vanquished nation after the catastrophe of the destruction of Jerusalem.  <br>  <br>**Later Renditions**  <br>it seemed that even if the biblical text was set down in writing long after the events it describes, it must have been based on a substantial body of accurately preserved memories.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Sure! For scholars such as these and others it _must be._ If they're to keep their careers and parking spots, the Bible must be based on facts, even though no one's ever been able to find any.<br><br>  <br>But suggesting that the most famous stories of the Bible did not happen as the Bible records them is far from implying that ancient Israel had no genuine history.  <br>  <br>**Abraham**  <br>Abraham took as his concubine Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian slave. Together they had a child named Ishmael, who would in time become the ancestor of all the Arab peoples of the southern wilderness.  <br>  <br>God promised Abraham another child, and his beloved wife, Sarah, miraculously gave birth to a son, Isaac, when Abraham was a hundred years old.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Here we have a hint about Abraham's first son, Ishmael, being born of an _Egyptian_. Moreover, Abraham's wife's name Sarah, comes from a word meaning "princess."<br><br>  <br>Many the stories connected with Abraham are set in the southern part of the hill country, specifically the region of Hebron in southern Judah.  <br>  <br>**Sarah's Tomb**  <br>purchased the Machpelah cave in Hebron in the southern hill country for burying his beloved wife, Sarah. He would also later be buried there.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The ancient pre-Celts and Celts buried their dead in mounds, as did many Nordic and Scythian tribes.<br><br>  <br>**Jacob & Esau**  <br>Jacob soon fled from the wrath of his aggrieved brother and journeyed far to the north to the house of his uncle Laban in Haran, to find a wife for himself. On his way north God confirmed Jacob’s inheritance.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So from the outset there was cunning and deception among the chosen. Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau, Joseph and his brothers. What does it all tell us?<br><br>  <br>**Jacob the Patriarch**  <br>Jacob continued northward to Haran and stayed with Laban several years, marrying his two daughters, Leah and Rachel, and fathering eleven sons - Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, and Joseph - from his two wives and from their two maidservants.  <br>  <br>**Jacob Renamed**  <br>the mysterious figure changed Jacob’s name to Israel (literally, “He who struggled with God”), “for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.”  <br>  <br>The children of Israel were at last reunited, and the aged patriarch Jacob came to live with his entire family near his great son, in the land of Goshen.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Every story has to have a happy ending.<br><br>  <br>And after the death of Jacob, his body was taken back to Canaan - to the territory that would someday become Judah’s tribal inheritance - and was buried by his sons in the cave of Machpelah in Hebron.  <br>  <br>**Judah**  <br>Among Jacob’s twelve sons, each of whom would become the patriarch of a tribe of Israel, Judah is given the special honor of ruling them all.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The name is better rendered _Iudah_. After the fall of Judah and Babylonian captivity it was rendered Yehuda or Yehudim. But the letter Y wasn't actually used in anceint times. Therefore the correct rendering is Iuda or Iudah, which also gives Yahud, Yehew, Yahoo, Auda and Audi. The letter "I" also stands for Jehovah. Both Y and I stand for the yew tree (Iodh) and the priests of the yew - the Druids. The term "Jew" is therefore purely Aryan or Druidic. It's no surprise that Yahweh first appears at a "burning bush." ([Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007EI6456/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) for more...)|---|

|---|**Finding Evidence**  <br>...the search for the historical patriarchs was ultimately unsuccessful, since none of the periods around the biblically suggested date provided a completely compatible background to the biblical stories. The assumed westward migration of groups from Mesopotamia toward Canaan - the so-called Amorite migration, in which Albright placed the arrival of Abraham and his family - was later shown to be illusory.  <br>  <br>**More Concessions**  <br>According to Finkelstein and Silberman, the story of Jacob and Esau was not based on actual history, but was a story supposed to commemorate the rivalry between tribes and states. They write:  <br>  <br>...the stories of Jacob and Esau - of the delicate son and the mighty hunter - are skillfully fashioned as archaizing legends to reflect the rivalries of late monarchic times.  <br>  <br>**Alternatives**  <br>During the eighth and seventh centuries the lucrative caravan trade in spices and rare incense from southern Arabia, winding through the deserts and the southern frontier of Judah to the ports of the Mediterranean, was a significant factor in the entire region’s economic life. For the people of Judah, a number of peoples of nomadic origins were crucial to this long-range trade system. Several of the genealogies included in the patriarchal stories offer a detailed picture of the peoples of the southern and eastern deserts during late monarchic times and they explain - again through the metaphor of family relationships - what role they played in Judah’s contemporary history.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Sounds good, but what real evidence is there? According to Comyns Beaumont, the stories pertaining to patriarchs and their offspring found in the Old Testament actually pertain not to Judea, Israel, and their surrounds but to the history of Britain, cunningly transposed to a new venue by mythmongers. References to "great cities" and kings, etc, are also references to the Celtic and pre-Celtic civilizations of the West. Refuting scholars who cite passages purporting to demonstrate local knowledge of the area, as well as knowledge of Assyria or Babylon, etc, Beaumont's opinion was that the Jewish mythmongers knew not of such locales themselves, but had access to the writings and accounts of others who did - of Egyptian, Persian and Arabian migrants, merchants and travelers for example. Therefore we are not to automatically accept any passage or verse regardless of how many geographical descriptions they contain. Such passages are _not_ to be accepted as legitimate "proof" that the scribes of the Bible had personal knowledge of Judea's locales, or any other neighboring place. ([Here](http://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/comyns-beaumont-2.html) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**Judah and Israel**  <br>...Judah was a rather isolated and sparsely populated kingdom until the eighth century BCE. It was hardly comparable in territory, wealth, and military might to the kingdom of Israel in the north. Literacy was very limited and **its capital, Jerusalem, was a small, remote hill country town.**  <br>  <br>Yet after the northern kingdom of Israel was liquidated by the Assyrian empire in 720 BCE, Judah grew enormously in population, developed complex state institutions, and emerged as a meaningful power in the region. It was ruled by an ancient dynasty and possessed the most important surviving Temple to the God of Israel...**It saw its very survival as evidence of God’s intention, from the time of the patriarchs, that Judah should rule over all the land of Israel.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Just one more thing that _never_ came to pass. The holy people got it wrong on many occasions, as did Yahweh. It's all played well down by scholars and clergy. ([Here](https://www.astrotheologyzone.com/r-e-friedman.html) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**More Subtle Concessions**  <br>In the admittedly fragmentary evidence of the E version of the patriarchal stories, presumably compiled in the northern kingdom of Israel before its destruction in 720 BCE, the tribe of Judah plays almost no role. But by the late eighth and certainly seventh century BCE, Judah was the center of what was left of the Israelite nation. In that light, **we should regard the J version of the patriarchal narratives primarily as a literary attempt to redefine the unity of the people of Israel - rather than as an accurate record of the lives of historical characters living more than a millennium before.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: A monumental concession from top academics, that from now on we must _not_ simply take Biblical passages as actual fact, or as actual accounts of specific historical events. They appear as such only on the surface, but were composed for other reasons. Scholars admit this while still holding to the theory that the passages verify the existence of actual tribes. Less biased readers, not holding prestigious academic careers, have no reason to think this, no need to accept any passage or verse in the Old Testament as anything other than part of an elaborate and largely unconfirmed _story._ Finkelstein and Silberman almost admit as much. We read:  <br>    <br><br>  <br>The landscape of the patriarchal stories is a dreamlike romantic vision of the pastoral past, especially appropriate to the pastoral background of a large proportion of the Judahite population. **It was stitched together from memory, snatches of ancient customs, legends of the birth of peoples, and the concerns aroused by contemporary conflicts.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Or, as Beaumont insists, it could have been stitched together from fragments of someone else's history, of races, peoples and individuals whose identities have been deliberately concealed and transmogrified. These characters and places flourished long before the seventh century BC, when Genesis and Deuteronomy were composed. Although top scholars remain reticent on this point, it can't be denied that the Book of Genesis is itself based on the much earlier Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh. Why is it not conceded that this is the case with other famous biblical accounts? Not surprisingly these authors provide no comment on this revealing connection. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**Deception**  <br>Unlike other ancient Near Eastern mythologies, such as the Egyptian tales of Osiris, Isis, and Horus or the Mesopotamian Gilgamesh epic, the Bible is grounded firmly in earthly history.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Right, the Bible _is_ based firmly on earthly history; that of Sumeria, Babylon, Egypt and other lands. Despite the deceptiveness of modern biblicists, we can no longer logically doubt this.|---|

|---|Strange how many images of the patriarchs, and other characters of the Bible, depict them as distinctly Caucasian. _Noah’s cheeks were whiter than snow and redder than a rose; his eyes like rays of the morning sun; his hair long and curly; his face aglow with light -_ (Hebrew Bible)|---|

|---|**Academic Hogwash**  <br>The great genius of the seventh century creators of this national epic was the way in which they wove the earlier stories together without stripping them of their humanity or individual distinctiveness. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob remain at the same time vivid spiritual portraits and the metaphorical ancestors of the people of Israel.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Visit these pages on this site to see if this is true. ([Here](https://www.astrotheologyzone.com/kersey-graves.html) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**A Subtle Hint**  <br>In the artistry of the biblical narrative, the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were indeed made into a single family. It was the power of legend that united them - in a manner far more powerful and timeless than the fleeting adventures of a few historical individuals herding sheep in the highlands of Canaan could ever have done.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Behind the sophistry, Finkelstein and Silberman confess that it's a matter of scribal "artistry" and legend rather than concrete fact.<br><br>  <br>**The Exodus**  <br>So important is this story of the Israelites’ liberation from bondage that the biblical books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy - a full four-fifths of the central scriptures of Israel - are devoted to the momentous events experienced by a single generation in slightly more than forty years.  <br>  <br>**But is it history? Can archaeology help us pinpoint the era when a leader named Moses mobilized his people for the great act of liberation?**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Isn't it peculiar and alarming that this question is still being posed in 2001, when this book was published? If the story _was_ true, it would have been put to bed long before now. That we are still asking this question doesn't favor the affirmative answer. Not in the least. As author Ralph Ellis shows, there were in fact _two_ separate exoduses of the so-called "Israelites," from Egypt. In both cases, the truth of the matter is radically different from commonly accepted Biblical accounts. Mainstream academics still have to catch-up with the actual facts, something they will never do, given what it implies for the future of religion and history. The first perplexing puzzle is why the authors of the Book of Exodus fail to mention the name of the reigning pharaoh in charge of the captivity and enslavement of the twelve Israelite tribes. And that's just for starters. Even the official story doesn't paint the Israelites in a good light, given that the pharaoh enslaves them in fear that they're about to betray Egypt to its enemies. Nice to know that God's chosen people are liars, cheats, and disloyal betrayers. Next, we must ask why on earth the chosen people "multiplied and grew exceedingly strong" while under the bonds of captivity? What kind of imprisonment are we dealing with?<br><br>  <br>“...the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied” - (Exodus 1:12).  <br>  <br>**Moses**  <br>Fearing a population explosion of these dangerous immigrant workers, the pharaoh ordered that all Hebrew male infants be drowned in the Nile. Yet from this desperate measure came the instrument of the Hebrews’ liberation. A child from the tribe of Levi - set adrift in a basket of bulrushes - was found and adopted by one of the pharaoh’s daughters. He was given the name Moses (from the Hebrew root “to draw out” of the water) and raised in the royal court. Years later, when Moses had grown to adulthood, he saw an Egyptian taskmaster flaying a Hebrew slave and his deepest feelings rose to the surface. He slew the taskmaster and “hid his body in the sand.”  <br>  <br>...it was in the course of his wandering as a solitary shepherd near Horeb, “the mountain of God,” that he received the revelation that would change the world.  <br>  <br>**Yahweh Appears**  <br>From the brilliant, flickering flames of a bush in the desert, which was burning yet was not consumed, the God of Israel revealed himself to Moses as the deliverer of the people of Israel. He proclaimed that he would free them of their taskmasters and bring them to a life of freedom and security in the Promised Land. God identified himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - and now also revealed to Moses his mysterious, mystical name, YHWH, “I am who I am.” And he solemnly commissioned Moses, with the assistance of his brother Aaron, to return to Egypt to confront the pharaoh with a demonstration of miracles and to demand freedom for the house of Israel.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Although Yahweh's will is carried out by obedient Moses, for some reason left unexplained, God "hardens Pharaoh's heart," so that on more than one occasion the pharaoh prevents the release of the Israelites. This makes absolutely no sense, like a great many biblical stories. In fact, the only "sense" it makes is as a _story_ or dramatic tale, nothing more, since such a thing simply doesn't happen in real life. Strangely, the unnamed pharaoh doesn't relent even after ten monstrous plagues descend and devastate his country. Right! So despite unimaginable suffering and destruction - the killing of Egypt's firstborn children - the pharaoh still doesn't get rid of these troublesome folks. He does so _after_ the worst happens. The 600,000 chosen ones are finally set free, and leave Egypt laden with gold, silver, camels, bulls, cows and other expensive trappings. So much for the cruelly treated "slaves" of Egypt.<br><br>  <br>**Arrival in Canaan**  <br>Setting off from their camp at the wilderness of Paran, the Israelites sent spies to collect intelligence on the people of Canaan (Numbers 13). But those spies returned with reports so frightening about the strength of the Canaanites and the towering fortifications of their cities that the multitude of Israelites lost heart and rebelled against Moses, begging to return to Egypt, where at least their physical safety could be ensured. Seeing this, God determined that the generation that had known slavery in Egypt would not live to inherit the Promised Land, and the Israelites must remain wanderers in the wilderness for another forty years.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: What a great pity God didn't know this would happen beforehand. Even God learns from experience. That's good to know. However, the whole epic still looks as if it's largely fictional. At least to sane people.<br><br>  <br>**Egypt, the Bread Basket**  <br>From earliest recorded times throughout antiquity, Egypt beckoned as a place of shelter and security for the people of Canaan at times when drought, famine, or warfare made life unbearable or even difficult.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This is not to be passed by casually. As Comyns Beaumont shows, this in itself proves that the lands stolen by the Israelites were relatively poor compared to those of Egypt. They were by no means able to sustain a large civilization, and according to Beaumont they did _not_ do so. It was not only the land which was primitive, but likewise the colonizers. Strange for a people said to have spent 400 years among the Egyptians, one of the most advanced and civilized races in world history. Similarly, why did the Israelites need Phoenician craftsmen to build their first temple of Solomon if they were so unique, advanced and inspired by God?<br><br>  <br>Egypt had always provided a safe haven in time of famine and an asylum for runaways, and was perceived as a potential ally against invasions from the north.  <br>  <br>**A "Second Law"**  <br>This second code of law is contained in the Book of Deuteronomy (named from the Greek word _deuteronomion_, “second law”).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This second law isn't Yahweh's law, it the law of the priests, those who became the Levites, and after the death of Moses the Levitical Aaronites. One would have thought the 10 Commandments given by God himself to Moses would have been enough to get on with. Moreover, what of the Oral Law or Oral Torah? What was that, and why was it required? ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Deuteronomy) & [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Torah) for more...)<br><br>  <br>_According to Jewish tradition, the Oral Torah was passed down orally in an unbroken chain from generation to generation until its contents were finally committed to writing following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, when Jewish civilization was faced with an existential threat, by virtue of the dispersion of the Jewish people_ - Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia  <br>  <br>_The major repositories of the Oral Torah are the Mishnah, compiled between 200–220 CE by Rabbi Yehudah haNasi, and the Gemara, a series of running commentaries and debates concerning the Mishnah, which together form the Talmud, the preeminent text of Rabbinic Judaism_ - ibid  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So we see that Talmud preserves a measure of the mysterious Oral Law, transmitted to the seventy elect. We deduce that these were the prototypes for the rabbis of later times. Or more correctly what the rabbis interpret the Oral Law to be is preserved in the Mishnah, Gemara and Talmud. It might not bear the slightest resemblance to the actual thing. Some scholars are of the opinion that the Oral Law was related to the doctrine of the Kabala and was _occult_ in nature. This holds true because what rabbis normally claim the orally transmitted law to be is far to intricate and voluminous to be memorized by any listener. In this sense, the Oral Law is not oral at all, but a secret law not to be disclosed to the laity.<br><br>  <br>**Hyksos**  <br>Manetho described a massive, brutal invasion of Egypt by foreigners from the east, whom he called Hyksos, an enigmatic Greek form of an Egyptian word that he translated as “shepherd kings” but that actually means “rulers of foreign lands.”  <br>  <br>Manetho reported that the Hyksos established themselves in the delta at a city named Avaris. And they founded a dynasty there that ruled Egypt with great cruelty for more than five hundred years. In the early years of modern research, scholars identified the Hyksos with the kings of the Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt, who ruled from about 1670 to 1570 BCE.  <br>  <br>Recent archaeological excavations in the eastern Nile delta have confirmed that conclusion and indicate that the Hyksos “invasion” was a gradual process of immigration from Canaan to Egypt, rather than a lightning military campaign.  <br>  <br>The fact that Manetho, writing almost fifteen hundred years later, describes a brutal invasion rather than a gradual, peaceful immigration should probably be understood on the background of his own times, when memories of the invasions of Egypt by the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE were still painfully fresh in the Egyptian consciousness.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So Mr. Author, while you apparently have no problem admitting that an _Egyptian_ historian and scribe was guilty of mythmongering and embellishment, it never crosses your mind that anyone else was guilty of the same liberty, and that many a biblical account was likewise deliberately contrived. Nice going.<br><br>  <br>Manetho suggested that after the Hyksos were driven from Egypt, they founded the city of Jerusalem and constructed a temple there. Far more trustworthy is an Egyptian source of the sixteenth century BCE that recounts the exploits of Pharaoh Ahmose, of the Eighteenth Dynasty, who sacked Avaris and chased the remnants of the Hyksos to their main citadel in southern Canaan - Sharuhen, near Gaza - which he stormed after a long siege.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: No matter what facts are uncovered concerning the Hyksos, academics simply refuse to connect them with the Israelites. There's too much to lose by doing so. The whole of Jewish and Christian history would have to be radically revised. Gone would be the traditional images of and tropes about Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and the other patriarchs. Gone would be the references to humble slaves under a tyrannous pharaoh. Indeed, the tyrants would now be the Israelites themselves. In any case, the exodus of Ahmose's time was the first of two, separated by hundreds of years. What academics never admit is that the two accounts were conflated by mythmongers. Additionally, these expulsions of the Hyksos nobility from Upper Egypt to Lower Egypt explains the references to "slaves." For short periods of time during the expulsions, the Hyksos were forced to rebuild the temple structure they had destroyed during their oppressive reign. This practice carried on into the reign of Ramesses II, and has been deliberately misrepresented. It was done as a legitimate exercise in penalization and reparation. Typically, the authors, in their attempt to locate the Jews in Egypt, cite the Stele of Merenptah, which allegedly speaks of the "Israel." They fail to mention that this inscription has long been proved a clever forgery  of nineteenth century archaeologists. The prime mover was British- Israelite Sir Flinders Petrie. ([Here](https://www.davidovits.info/error-or-forgery-on-the-stele-of-merneptah-known-as-israel-stele/) for more...)<br><br>  <br>The Merneptah Stele contains the first appearance of the name Israel in any surviving ancient text.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Remember, these authors are _top academics_. Yup!<br><br>  <br>**Lack of Evidence**  <br>The border between Canaan and Egypt was thus closely controlled. If a great mass of fleeing Israelites had passed through the border fortifications of the pharaonic regime, a record should exist. Yet in the abundant Egyptian sources describing the time of the New Kingdom in general and the thirteenth century in particular, there is no reference to the Israelites, not even a single clue.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This is because there was no exodus out of Egypt to Canaan as told in the contrived biblical texts. The Hyksos were expelled from Upper to Lower Egypt, their original homeland in the area. Those who decided to vacate Egypt completely were the elite Atonists under Akhenaton and his descendants.

|---|**Academics Admit Problems**  <br>the escape of more than a tiny group from Egyptian control at the time of Ramesses II seems highly unlikely, as is the crossing of the desert and entry into Canaan. In the thirteenth century, Egypt was at the peak of its authority - the dominant power in the world. The Egyptian grip over Canaan was firm; Egyptian strongholds were built in various places in the country, and Egyptian officials administered the affairs of the region.  <br>  <br>large Egyptian armies marched through Canaan to the north, as far as the Euphrates in Syria. Therefore, the main overland road that went from the delta along the coast of northern Sinai to Gaza and then into the heart of Canaan was of utmost importance to the pharaonic regime.  <br>  <br>...one can hardly accept the idea of a flight of a large group of slaves from Egypt through the heavily guarded border fortifications into the desert and then into Canaan in the time of such a formidable Egyptian presence.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Which strengthens the hypothesis of those proposing that it was a _royal_ party who would have been permitted to pass into lands beyond Egypt's boundaries. And it makes no sense to believe that the wandering Jews took forty years to secure a new homeland after their exodus. Why? What was Yahweh doing all this time? What was wrong with Moses? Why were the Jews not correctly advised by intelligent persons within their people about where to settle? Yes, well these authors actually concede that the tale was "wildly exaggerated."<br><br>  <br>**Some archaeological traces of their generation-long wandering in the Sinai should be apparent. However, except for the Egyptian forts along the northern coast, not a single campsite or sign of occupation from the time of Ramesses II and his immediate predecessors and successors has ever been identified in Sinai. And it has not been for lack of trying.**  <br>  <br>Repeated archaeological surveys in all regions of the peninsula, including the mountainous area around the traditional site of Mount Sinai, near Saint Catherine’s Monastery, have yielded only negative evidence: not even a single sherd, no structure, not a single house, no trace of an ancient encampment.  <br>  <br>...modern archaeological techniques are quite capable of tracing even the very meager remains of hunter-gatherers and pastoral nomads all over the world.  <br>  <br>**There is simply no such evidence at the supposed time of the Exodus in the thirteenth century BCE.** **The conclusion - that the Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible - seems irrefutable.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Frustrated with this lack of evidence, academics scramble to propose other explanations for the exodus, suggesting that it took place at this or that _later_ date. Facts must somehow be found to fit their theories. The consensus is now that the exodus took place during Egypt's _twenty-sixth_ dynasty, during the seventh century reigns of Pharaoh Psammetichus I (664-610 BC) and his son Necho II (610–595 BCE). In this way, scholars can preserve their essential belief in the physical existence of the Israelites. They offer no comment about what this means for the poor level of scholarship of _previous_ biblicists who should long ago have identified the period when the exodus took place, instead of insisting that it occurred at a time for which there is apparently little to no hard evidence. Of course, had these authors bothered to read the work of Ralph Ellis, all would stand revealed, preventing further academic error. Even with their previous loose theories taken somewhat seriously, there's not enough evidence preventing one rationally concluding that the entire story of an captivity and exodus is simply a priest-manufactured _story_.<br><br>  <br>**The saga of Israel’s Exodus from Egypt is neither historical truth nor literary fiction. It is a powerful expression of memory and hope born in a world in the midst of change.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: What a shattering concession. This has enormous consequences for biblicists and believers. It radically alters the view of the past for Jews and Christians. But who will bravely accept these findings and conclusions? Will believers simply wave the "reality" of their coveted narratives as easily as these top scholars?<br><br>  <br>**Book of Judges**  <br>...the book of Judges presents an extraordinarily rich collection of thrilling war stories and tales of individual heroism in the battles between the Israelites and their neighbors. It contains some of the Bible’s most colorful characters and most unforgettable images.  <br>  <br>It is clear that this theological interpretation of the tales in the book of Judges was developed centuries after the events it purportedly describes.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: In plain language, the book is worthless as evidence, presenting nothing more than a story. Since this book makes up a part of the history presented in Deuteronomy, are we to trust the latter anymore than the former?<br><br>  <br>**Conquest of Canaan**  <br>Once the great conquest of Canaan was completed, the book of Joshua related in great detail how the Israelite leader divided the land - now mostly cleared of the indigenous Canaanite population - among the victorious Israelite tribes as their eternal inheritances.  <br>  <br>Once the great conquest of Canaan was over, the book of Joshua informs us, “the land had rest from war” (Joshua 11:23). All the Canaanites and other indigenous peoples of Canaan had been utterly destroyed. Joshua convened the tribes to divide the land.  <br>  <br>...within the book of Joshua and the following book of Judges are some serious contradictions to this picture of the tribes inheriting the entire land of Israel. Although the book of Joshua at one point declares that the Israelites had taken possession of all the land God promised and had defeated all their enemies (Joshua 21: 43–44), other passages in the book of Joshua and in the book of Judges make it clear that many Canaanites and Philistines lived in close proximity to the Israelites.  <br>  <br>**Problems with the Account**  <br>Though the Israelites might not have marched into Canaan as a unified army, the signs of their arrival seemed to be clear. In comparison to the monumental buildings, imported luxury items, and fine ceramic vessels uncovered in the levels of the preceding Canaanite cities, **the rough encampments and implements of the arriving Israelites seemed to be on a far lower level of civilization than the remains of the population they replaced.**  <br>  <br>It was thus assumed that the Israelites were scattered groups of arriving pastoralists rather than a unified army.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Finkelstein and Silberman toy with the idea that these Israelite wanderers were perhaps the infamous Apiru, or perhaps the Shasu. This paints the Israelites not as nobles from Egypt, but as low bred gypsy-like rabble. In my work I cast them as the lower rank and file of the Hyksos people expelled from Egypt. While the elites went on to dwell with relatives in the high cultures surrounding Egypt, the lower class was jettisoned and left to their own devices. Those who lived meagerly in Canaan might well have been these troublesome vagabonds. We do not know their fate. It's a scenario now being seriously considered by scholars:<br><br>  <br>Some of them may have become Apiru, that is, people living on the fringe of the society, causing troubles to the authorities. Many resettled in the relatively empty forests of the highlands, far from Canaanite and Egyptian control. And in their new homeland these peasant rebels established a more equal society - less stratified and less rigid. In doing so, they became “Israelites.”  <br>  <br>**Did it Happen?**  <br>...as we have seen, the Israelite Exodus did not take place in the manner described in the Bible, what of the conquest itself? The problems are even greater. How could an army in rags, traveling with women, children, and the aged, emerging after decades from the desert, possibly mount an effective invasion? How could such a disorganized rabble overcome the great fortresses of Canaan, with their professional armies and well-trained corps of chariots?  <br>  <br>The Canaanite forces were annihilated and the children of Israel settled down to divide the land among the tribes as their God-given inheritance.  <br>  <br>**Did the conquest of Canaan really happen? Is this central saga of the Bible - and of the subsequent history of Israel - history, or myth?**  <br>  <br>...the evidence on the general political and military landscape of Canaan suggests that a lightning invasion by this group would have been impractical and unlikely in the extreme.  <br>  <br>The princes of the Canaanite cities (described in the book of Joshua as powerful enemies) were, in actuality, pathetically weak.  <br>  <br>It is highly unlikely that the Egyptian garrisons throughout the country would have remained on the sidelines as a group of refugees (from Egypt) wreaked havoc throughout the province of Canaan.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So again we have to completely doubt one of the important narratives of the Old Testament, concerning the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites after their release from Egypt and move northwards. It certainly works as a _story,_ but not as actual history. The only independent account of this conflict was the Merenptah Stele, eventually proven to be a forgery. What we're dealing with, and what the authors concede, is "literary expressions." It's the same old "pious fraud," exposed by scholars of past centuries.<br><br>  <br>Even as the world press was reporting that Joshua’s conquest had been confirmed, many of the most important pieces of the archaeological puzzle simply did not fit.  <br>  <br>**If, as archaeology suggests, the sagas of the patriarchs and the Exodus were legends, compiled in later periods, and if there is no convincing evidence of a unified invasion of Canaan under Joshua, what are we to make of the Israelites’ claims for ancient nationhood?**  <br>  <br>**Change in Viewpoint**  <br>In the formerly sparsely populated highlands from the Judean hills in the south to the hills of Samaria in the north, far from the Canaanite cities that were in the process of collapse and disintegration, about two-hundred fifty hilltop communities suddenly sprang up. Here were the first Israelites.  <br>  <br>It is also noteworthy - in contrast to the Bible’s accounts of almost continual warfare between the Israelites and their neighbors - that the villages were not fortified...No weapons, such as swords or lances, were uncovered...Nor were there signs of burning or sudden destruction that might indicate a violent attack.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Scholarship in complete meltdown. Since no account in the Bible could be proven by hard archeological evidence, and since that evidence often contradicted the Bible, scholars were forced to change tack. New accounts for the origin and presence of the "Israelites" _have_ to be found if complete disaster is to averted.<br><br>  <br>**The New Scenario**  <br>As we now know, however, the Bible’s stirring picture of righteous Israelite judges - however powerful and compelling - has very little to do with what really happened in the hill country of Canaan in the Early Iron Age.  <br>  <br>The process that we describe here is, in fact, the opposite of what we have in the Bible: the emergence of early Israel was an outcome of the collapse of the Canaanite culture, not its cause.  <br>  <br>And most of the Israelites did not come from outside Canaan - they emerged from within it. There was no mass Exodus from Egypt. There was no violent conquest of Canaan. Most of the people who formed early Israel were local people - the same people whom we see in the highlands throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages. The early Israelites were - irony of ironies - themselves originally Canaanites!  <br>  <br>**King David**  <br>The violent chaos of the period of the Judges now gave way to a time in which God’s promises could be established securely under a righteous king. Though the first choice for the throne of Israel had been the brooding, handsome Saul from the tribe of Benjamin, it was his successor David who became the central figure in early Israelite history.  <br>  <br>His son Solomon, in turn, is remembered as the wisest of kings and the greatest of builders. Stories tell of his brilliant judgments, his unimaginable wealth, and his construction of the great Temple in Jerusalem.  <br>  <br>For centuries, Bible readers all over the world have looked back to the era of David and Solomon as a golden age in Israel’s history.  <br>  <br>**Until recently many scholars have agreed that the united monarchy was the first biblical period that could truly be considered historical...Yet many of the archaeological props that once bolstered the historical basis of the David and Solomon narratives have recently been called into question.**  <br>  <br>...the monuments ascribed to Solomon are now most plausibly connected with other kings.  <br>  <br>Even as Saul still reigned as king of Israel he was unaware that his successor had already been chosen.  <br>  <br>God instructed Samuel to go to the family of Jesse from Bethlehem...The youngest of those sons was a handsome, red-haired shepherd named David, would finally bring salvation to Israel.  <br>  <br>Escaping Saul’s murderous fury, David became leader of a band of fugitives and soldiers of fortune, with people in distress or deep in debt flocking to him.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Another rivalry among God's chosen ones, and _not_ over a woman. Soon after, David's son Absalom goes rogue and wars with his father. All's well in God's perfect kingdom.<br><br>  <br>David and his men men roamed in the foothills of the Shephelah, in the Judean desert, and in the southern margins of the Judean hills - all regions located away from the centers of power of Saul’s kingdom to the north of Jerusalem.  <br>  <br>Tragically, in battle with the Philistines far to the north at Mount Gilboa, Saul’s sons were killed by the enemy and Saul took his own life...David proceeded quickly to the ancient city of Hebron in Judah, where the people of Judah declared him king.  <br>  <br>This was the beginning of the great Davidic state and lineage, the beginning of the glorious united monarchy.|---|

|---|Given that the name Philistine comes from a root denoting Palestine, it's obvious that the race was in existence in Canaan _before_ the Israelites. How many traditions did the latter appropriate and "magpie" from the former? In Greek, _Philis_ means "green," and connotes liviliness, growth and hortiiculatural expertize. _Philo_ means "loving." or "caring for." The term also ocnnotes "brotherliness" and "kindredness." In Gaelic _Fili_ means "high born" and "aristocratic." So, despite biblical deceptiveness, in reality were the "giant"  Philistines the "great ones" in terms of knowledge and skill? ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines#Etymology) for more...)|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|**Epic King, Epic Wars**  <br>David then initiated sweeping wars of liberation and expansion. In a series of swift battles he destroyed the power of the Philistines and defeated the Ammonites, the Moabites, and the Edomites in Transjordan, concluding his campaigns with the subjugation of the Arameans far to the north. Returning in triumph to Jerusalem, David now ruled over a vast territory, far more extensive even than the tribal inheritances of Israel.  <br>  <br>**Solomon**  <br>Just before David’s death, the priest Zadok anointed Solomon to be the next king of Israel.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Remember that this priesthood dated to the time of Abraham and his early period into Canaan. In my work I consider the enigmatic Melchizedek to be a pseudonym of Akhenaton or one of his later Atonist commanders. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Zadok) & [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadok#Priesthood_transition) & [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchizedek) for more...)<br><br>  <br>Solomon, to whom God gave “wisdom and understanding beyond measure,” consolidated the Davidic dynasty and organized its empire, which now stretched from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt  <br>  <br>**They Didn't Exist**  <br>That David and Solomon are such central religious icons to both Judaism and Christianity that the recent assertions of radical biblical critics that King David is “no more a historical figure than King Arthur,” have been greeted in many religious and scholarly circles with outrage and disdain.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: And even more controversially, that their inventors used the western antetpyes as their basis.<br><br>  <br>**Thomas Thompson and Niels Peter Lemche of the University of Copenhagen and Philip Davies of the University of Sheffield...have argued that David and Solomon, the united monarchy of Israel, and indeed the entire biblical description of the history of Israel are no more than elaborate, skillful ideological constructs produced by priestly circles in Jerusalem in post-exilic or even Hellenistic times.**  <br>  <br>...the minimalists have some points in their favor. A close reading of the biblical description of the days of Solomon clearly suggests that this was a portrayal of an idealized past, a glorious Golden Age.  <br>  <br>...neither David nor Solomon is mentioned in a single known Egyptian or Mesopotamian text. And the archaeological evidence in Jerusalem for the famous building projects of Solomon is nonexistent. Nineteenth-and early twentieth-century excavations around the Temple Mount in Jerusalem failed to identify even a trace of Solomon’s fabled Temple or palace complex.  <br>  <br>in the summer of 1993, at the biblical site of Tel Dan in northern Israel, a fragmentary artifact was discovered that would change forever the nature of the debate. It was the “House of David” inscription, part of a black basalt monument, found broken and reused in a later stratum as a building stone...This is dramatic evidence of the fame of the Davidic dynasty less than a hundred years after the reign of David’s son Solomon. Jerusalem) is referred to with only a mention of its ruling house is clear evidence that the reputation of David was not a literary invention of a much later period.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Let's hope it's not finally discovered to be a forgery. It certainly doesn't prove the existence of the Biblical King David, since the word is not in fact a name but at _title_ borne by several ancient nobles. The consonants DVD (giving _David_) are a later transliteration of TUT, as found in names/titles such as Tutankhamen, Thutmoses and Thoth. It meant "commander" or "leader." Remember also that pharaohs each had _five_ names, some serving as titles. The custom was adopted by royals of other lands. We see then that the "name" David simply means "leader" and does not necessarily denote a specific historical personality, as we've been cunningly led to believe. As I show elsewhere, the original syllable TUT also gives us Truth, Tudor, Tutor, Teuton, Dovid, Dove, Darwyd, Darwood, etc. The chief symbol of the "Davids" being the dove. All of this was well-known to the mythmongers who put together the _stories_ of David and Solomon, under Judaic guise.<br><br>  <br>**David's Realm (Judah)**  <br>Israel was surely the most densely populated state in the Levant, with far more inhabitants than Judah.  <br>  <br>Judah remained relatively empty of permanent population, quite isolated, and very marginal right up to and past the presumed time of David and Solomon, with no major urban centers and with no pronounced hierarchy of hamlets, villages, and towns.  <br>  <br>Judah’s distinctive society was determined in large measure by its remote geographical position, unpredictable rainfall, and rugged terrain. In contrast to the northern hill country with its broad valleys and natural overland routes to the neighboring regions, Judah was always marginal agriculturally and isolated from the main trade routes, offering any would-be ruler only meager opportunities for wealth.  <br>  <br>**The First Temple of Solomon?**  <br>...the quest for the remains of Solomon’s Temple was among the first challenges taken up by biblical archaeology in the nineteenth century.  <br>  <br>Jerusalem has been excavated time and again - and with a particularly intense period of investigation of Bronze and Iron Age remains in the 1970s and 1980s under the direction of Yigal Shiloh, of the Hebrew University, at the city of David, the original urban core of Jerusalem.  <br>  <br>**Surprisingly, as Tel Aviv University archaeologist David Ussishkin pointed out, fieldwork there and in other parts of biblical Jerusalem failed to provide significant evidence for a tenth century occupation. Not only was any sign of monumental architecture missing, but so were even simple pottery sherds. The types that are so characteristic of the tenth century at other sites are rare in Jerusalem.**  <br>  <br>it is highly unlikely that this sparsely inhabited region of Judah and the small village of Jerusalem could have become the center of a great empire stretching from the Red Sea in the south to Syria in the north.  <br>  <br>**There is absolutely no archaeological indication of the wealth, manpower and level of organization that would be required to support large armies - even for brief periods - in the field.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: These monumental concessions from official sources reveal the infernal acts of deception committed by authorities responsible for the fabricating the supposed "histories" of Judaism and Christianity.<br><br>  <br>**During Solomon's Reign**  <br>The area from Jerusalem to the north was quite densely settled, while the area from Jerusalem to the south - the hub of the future kingdom of Judah - was still very sparsely settled. Jerusalem itself was, at best, no more than a typical highland village. We can say no more than that.  <br>  <br>Out of a total of approximately forty-five thousand people living in the hill country, a full 90 percent would have inhabited the villages of the north. That would have left about five thousand people scattered among Jerusalem, Hebron, and about twenty small villages in Judah, with additional groups probably continuing as pastoralists. Such a small and isolated society like this would have been likely to cherish the memory of an extraordinary leader like David as his descendants continued to rule in Jerusalem over the next four hundred years.  <br>  <br>...by the seventh century BCE conditions in Judah had changed almost beyond reckoning. Jerusalem was now a relatively large city, dominated by a Temple to the God of Israel that served as the single national shrine. The institutions of monarchy, a professional army, and administration had reached a level of sophistication that met and even exceeded the complexity of the royal institutions of the neighboring states. And once again we can see the landscapes and costumes of seventh century Judah as the setting for an unforgettable biblical tale, this time of a mythical golden age.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Naturally Finkelstein and Silberman can't wholly accept their own findings. They can't bring themselves to accept that the evidence points to a compendium of _stories_ rather than legitimate biographies and histories. Judea might have been the "setting" alright, but it wasn't the place where things actually happened. It was the setting for the grandiose fiction not the fact.<br><br>  <br>**What More Proof is Required?**  <br>The course of Israel’s history - the books of Kings gravely inform us - moves with almost tragic inevitability from unity to schism and from schism to national catastrophe.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Yep. Nothing but conflict, rivalry, feuds and upheaval. As said, this is proof enough that fictional elements are predominately involved. One cannot talk of God's chosen people and Godly influence, and then in the same breath speak of the endless warring and bloodletting. At some point one must recognize that a real God could in no way have been involved with any of it. This is the story written by _men_ about the antics of men. It barely justifies being called "history," and sooner or later the whole world will reluctantly accept it.<br><br>  <br>**Reign of Chaos**  <br>After the glorious reigns of David and Solomon, when all Israel was ruled from Jerusalem and experienced a period of unprecedented prosperity and power, the tribes of the northern hill country and Galilee - resisting the tax demands of Solomon’s son Rehoboam - angrily break away. **What follows is two hundred years of division and hatred between brothers, with the independent Israelite kingdoms of Israel in the north and of Judah in the south intermittently poised to strike at each other’s throats.**  <br>  <br>New northern Israelite dynasties, rivals of the house of David, bloodily come to power one after another.  <br>  <br>**...it is simply not an accurate representation of the it is simply not an accurate representation of the** **historical reality. As we have seen, there is no compelling archaeological evidence for the historical existence of a vast united monarchy, centered in Jerusalem, that encompassed the entire land of Israel.**  <br>  <br>**Northern Sinners**  <br>In the Bible, the northern tribes are consistently depicted as weak-hearted failures, with a pronounced tendency to sinfulness. book of Judges, where the individual tribes struggle with the idolatrous peoples around them.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: We're talking the chosen of Yahweh, right?<br><br>  <br>The tribes of the north are another story. Benjamin, Manasseh, Ephraim, Zebulun, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan did not accomplish what they had to; they did not finish off the Canaanites. As a result they would be tempted again and again.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Yahweh curses them because they failed to commit genocide in his name. What backsliding rogues they were to disobey almighty God.<br><br>  <br>Saul, from the tribe of Benjamin, is said to have ruled over northern territories in the highlands. Yet Saul violated the laws of the cult and was driven to suicide after the defeat of his forces by the Philistines. God withdrew his blessing from this anointed northern leader, and the elders of the northern tribes duly turned to David, the outlaw-hero-king of Judah, and proclaimed him king over all of Israel.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: God wants kings who kill and murder, judging them on their ability to do so. That's the kind of god worth worshiping, right?<br><br>  <br>...the tribes are depicted in 1 Kings as being treated like little more than colonial subjects by David’s son Solomon.  <br>  <br>Upon the death of Solomon and the accession of his son Rehoboam, the northerners appealed for a reduction in their burden. But the arrogant Rehoboam dismissed the advice of his moderate counselors and replied to the northerners with the now famous words “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions” (1 Kings 12:14).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Perfect peace and brotherhood reigns among the holy people. Surely, surely, the meek shall inherit the earth.<br><br>  <br>The northerners then gathered to proclaim for themselves a monarch and chose Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who had served in the court of Solomon. The united monarchy of David and Solomon was completely shattered.  <br>  <br>**Two independent states were created: Judah, which was ruled by the Davidic dynasty from Jerusalem, with its territory limited to the southern part of the central hill country; and Israel, which controlled vast territories in the north.**  <br>  <br>The new king, Jeroboam, decided to set up rivals to the Temple in Jerusalem and ordered that two golden calves be fashioned and installed in shrines at the farthest corners of his kingdom - at Bethel  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Given that such a rift took place, it has been suggested that it caused many northerners to return to pagan worship. The priesthoods of the northern tribes - and/or certain breakaway sects within these priesthoods - returned to ancient goddess worship. These sects did not die away through time, but continued to establish satellite orders, later manifesting in the form of Masonic groups.<br><br>  <br>The breakup of the united monarchy was therefore seen as an unfortunate postscript to a story that had already run its course. It appeared as if only the arrogant and ill-advised tyranny of Solomon’s son Rehoboam destroyed the expansive grandeur of the Solomonic empire. This vision of the united monarchy and its downfall seemed to be confirmed by the archaeological finds.  <br>  <br>Shechem and Jerusalem, Israel and Judah, were always distinct and competing territories...Israel was well on the way to fully developed statehood within a few decades of the presumed end of the united monarchy,  <br>  <br>Put simply, Israel and Judah experienced quite different histories and developed distinctive cultures.  <br>  <br>**Why does the Bible tell a story of schism and secession of Israel from Judah that is at such great odds with the historical evidence?**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Amazingly, these authors question the idea of a dual monarchy. Perhaps it was also mythical, part of the great fictional composition of the priestly scribes, serving some propagandist purpose. A moralizing scribe may simply have decided to demonize Solomon, describing him as a sinner with many pagan wives. The tale works as a great melodrama, but hasn't an ounce of historical validity. A reading of 1 Kings 31-39 confirms that we're talking pure fiction. In despair, the authors reveal that the story was written a long time _after_ the fall of Israel, and is not to be considered a factual historical account of anything that actually happened. The scribes got so carried away with their fictionalizations that real life paled into insignificance. The story was better than the facts. This has made it almost impossible for us to discern actual historical details from purely fictional interpolations. The Old Testament drips with so much fiction, it's nigh on impossible to use it - as so many have done - as a legitimate historical document.<br><br>  <br>By that time the kingdom of Israel was already a fading memory, with its cities destroyed and large numbers of its inhabitants deported to far corners of the Assyrian empire. But Judah was, in the meantime, prospering and developing territorial ambitions, claiming to be the only legitimate heir to the extensive territories of Israel.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: If the scribes decided that the invasion of the north occurred because, in their minds, the northerners had turned to evil pagan practices, that does _not_ mean this was actually the case. Again, actual events were not honestly conveyed. Fictional elements and bias discolor the truth of the matter. This goes for the majority of what we find in the Hebrew Bible.<br><br>  <br>Violence, idolatry, and greed were the hallmarks of the northern kingdom of Israel as it is depicted in gory detail in the first and second books of Kings.|---|

|---|**Yahweh Proves False**  <br>The northern valleys and Galilee were thus conquered (732 BCE) and its inhabitants were deported, reversing the divine promises of the secure inheritance given at the time of the original conquest of Canaan by the Israelites.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: As far as the skillful mythmongers were concerned, a story had to be concocted to excuse this major faux pas. Something had to explain God's blunder. Hence the preposterous story of the "sinfulness" of the Israelites bringing about their downfall. No mention of why Yahweh didn't know this in advance _before_ making a sacred Covenant. In their story, the king of the Israelites, Pekah, is assassinated by his successor Hoshea, clearly another man of God.<br><br>  <br>The Assyrian noose was tightening with the accession of Shalmaneser V, an aggressive new Assyrian king. Hoshea proclaimed himself to be a loyal vassal and offered Shalmaneser tribute, but he secretly sought an alliance with the king of Egypt for an open revolt.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Very odd that the Israelites should, for any reason, turn to the Egyptians for help. Unlikely, that is, in real life, not in fiction. Again, we question Yahweh's competence. The Israelites and Judites are enslaved for 430 years in Egypt, spend forty years roaming the wastelands, spend 200 years in conflict with one another under the disunited monarchy, find themselves beset by _three_ invasions, and are taken into captivity for a century or more by Assyrians and Babylonians. Their temple is razed to the ground and incessant rivalries rage between kings and priesthoods, while upstarts of every kind claim the throne. With a God as incompetent as this, who needs a Devil?<br><br>  <br>After exiling the Israelites from their land to Mesopotamia, the Assyrians brought in new settlers to Israel: “And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the people of Israel; and they took possession of Samaria, and dwelt in its cities” (2 Kings 17:24).  <br>  <br>The ten northern tribes of Israel were now lost among the distant nations. kingdom of Judah, with its Temple and Davidic kings, now survived to carry on God’s commandments and to redeem the land of Israel.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Until it was invaded, subdued and deported by the Babylonians. Great going Yahweh. Interestingly, the ten northern Israelite tribes never returned after their release by the Assyrians. They scattered to the four winds in the so-called Diaspora. These are the so-called Lost Tribes. Heading westward over the Caucasus mountains, legend has it they entered Europe, eventually marrying in with many a noble house. Hence the plethora of "Israelite" symbolism found on western heraldry, such as the harp on Irish heraldic arms or Star of David on the insignia of Northern Ireland. After their captivity by the Babylonians, the Judites or Jews did make a return to their ancestral homeland in Judea. This is why Jewish history is referred as "Jewish." It is the history not of the ten lost tribes, breakers of the Covenant, but of the two tribes of Judah who stayed loyal to Yahweh throughout their captivity. Thanks to the confessions of Finkelstein and Silberman, we now know not to take any of this wholly as fact. Bracketing it as fact leaves the way lies open for us to take seriously the insightful geniuses of the past who tried to awaken a dismissive contemptuous world. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**Israel Falls**  <br>What followed was a tragic series of miscalculations that spelled the end of independent Israel - and indeed the possibility that any of the states in the Levant would ever be free to act independently as long as the Assyrian empire survived.  <br>  <br>Tiglath-pileser set his sights with full force on the kingdom of Israel. Conquering most of its territories, destroying its main cities, and deporting part of its population, Tiglathpileser brought Israel to its knees.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: God's mighty nation baits the tiger and rues the day. What divinely-inspired insightful people they were. If they weren't preoccupied by annihilating one another, they hotheadedly goaded their fiercest enemies to come and kick their asses. So much for Yahweh's breed of supreme diplomats.<br><br>  <br>By the time of Tiglath-pileser’s death in 727 BCE, most of the territory of the northern kingdom had been annexed directly to the Assyrian empire...the Assyrians deployed a policy of deportation and repopulation on a grand scale.  <br>  <br>After the partial destruction of the last Israelite city, a short period of abandonment was followed by extensive rebuilding. The Assyrians made Megiddo the capital of their new province, covering former territories of the northern kingdom in the northern valleys and the hills of Galilee. Within a few decades, official documents refer to Megiddo as the seat of the governor.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So what came from the Assyrian Period, later falsely attributed to the Israelites? What traditions and structures have been wrongly assigned to the latter? If Israel and Judah had long periods in which other tribes and nations dominated their lands and people, we can assume that a great deal of assimilation took place. Scholars concede this about those Israelites and Jews in captivity. It is accepted that while they lived in Assyria, Babylon and Persia, they adopted many traditions from their captors; motifs and tropes later assimilated even by the priests of Israel. It's a theme found throughout the books of the Old Testament. It has also been discovered that other forms of worship were incorporated. Of particular importance was goddess worship, carried on in secret by sects within the priesthood. (See other pages on this site.)  <br>    <br><br>  <br>_...most Israelites had embraced the easy-going Canaanite cult in which goddesses played the leading role, with kings as their consorts_ - Robert Graves (_Hebrew Myths_)  <br>  <br>...the ultimate fate of most of them - the ten tribes of northern Israel - would never be known. In the beginning the deportees might have tried to preserve their identity, for instance by continuing Israelite forms of worship or giving Israelite names to their children. But they were soon Assyrianized and assimilated into the empire.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Beaumont believed the story of the fall of Israel was concocted to cover the deception of the mythmongers. Israel never existed as their works portrayed, so having them at some point "exit stage left" served the cause of the scribes. _Poof, they're gone._ Who could disprove that they were never there in the first place? Who could prove that the "history" found in the scriptures wasn't adapted from that of nearby Canaanites, Phoenicians, Egyptians or even Philistines? Who would suspect, like Conor MacDari, that the Hebrew and Aramaic terms found throughout the scriptures contain _Gaelic_ roots?<br><br>  <br>**Aftermath**  <br>Our story now approaches that great moment in religious and literary history, because it was only after the fall of Israel that Judah grew into a fully developed state with the necessary complement of professional priests and trained scribes able to undertake such a task.  <br>  <br>It was in the ancient Judahite capital of Hebron - in the cave of Machpelah - that the revered patriarchs and matriarchs were buried, as we read in the book of Genesis.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Too bad no bodies have ever been found at this location or elsewhere.<br><br>  <br>The Judahites’ fidelity to God’s commands was unmatched among other Israelite warriors; at the time of the invasion of Canaan, only they were said to have fully eradicated the idolatrous Canaanite presence from their tribal inheritance.  <br>  <br>**Despite Judah’s prominence in the Bible, however, there is no archaeological indication until the eighth century BCE that this small and rather isolated highland area, surrounded by arid steppe land on both east and south, possessed any particular importance.**  <br>  <br>As we have seen, its population was meager; its towns - even Jerusalem - were small and few. It was Israel, not Judah, that initiated wars in the region. It was Israel, not Judah, that conducted wide-ranging diplomacy and trade.  <br>  <br>When the two kingdoms came into conflict, Judah was usually on the defensive, forced to call in neighboring powers to come to its aid.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Why such conflict? Weren't they all under the rule of God? In any case, the ever so holy Judah wasn't protected by their sovereign lord after all. Once again fate nullifies Yahweh's solemn edicts and promises. The mythmongers step in to explain it all away. Again, it's the _people_ who were at fault, as always.<br><br>  <br>**Judah's Fall**  <br>But beginning in the late eighth century BCE, something extraordinary happened. A series of epoch-making changes, beginning with Israel’s fall, suddenly altered the political and religious landscape. Judah’s population swelled to unprecedented levels.  <br>  <br>“Judah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord;” its people worshiped at high places “on every high hill” and imitated the practices of the nations (1 Kings 14:22–24). The punishment for this apostasy was quick and painful. The Egyptian pharaoh Shishak marched on Jerusalem in the fifth year of Rehoboam (926 BCE) and took away a heavy tribute from the treasures of the Temple and the palace of the Davidic kings (1 Kings 14:25–26).  <br>  <br>The kingdom of Judah experienced ups and downs through the following centuries, reaching a low point when Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram married into the sinful family of Ahab and Jezebel. Predictable misfortune resulted:  <br>  <br>Until a few years ago, virtually all biblical archaeologists accepted the scriptural description of the sister states of Judah and Israel at face value. They portrayed Judah as a fully developed state as early as the time of Solomon and tried their best to produce archaeological proof of the building activities and effective regional administration of the early Judahite kings. Y**et as we have shown, the supposed archaeological evidence of the united monarchy was no more than wishful thinking.**  <br>  <br>Archaeology shows that the early kings of Judah were not the equals of their northern counterparts in power or administrative ability despite the fact that their reigns and even accession dates are intertwined in the books of Kings.  <br>  <br>With the possible exception of the city of Lachish in the foothills of the Shephelah, there are no signs of elaborate regional centers within Judah on the scale of the northern sites of Gezer, Megiddo, and Hazor. Likewise, Judahite urban planning and architecture was far more rustic. Monumental building techniques - such as the use of ashlar masonry and Proto-Aeolic capitals that typified the elaborate Omride building style in the northern kingdom - did not appear in the south before the seventh century BCE.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Another key piece of evidence showing that the so-called Judites, like the Israelites - have, as civilizations, no roots or history to speak of, compared with civilizations such as Egypt, Persia, Sumeria and Babylon. It's just _not there,_ and not amount of mythmongering changes this fact. At least we concede now that such tribal groups, if they existed as portrayed at all, were relatively speaking extremely primitive and insignificant. So much for them _and_ their incompetent god. Remember too, that these critiques are based on the _content_ of the scriptures and cannot simply be dismissed as spurious attacks by irreverent outsiders.<br><br>  <br>**Despite the long-standing contention that the opulent Solomonic court was the scene of a flourishing of _belles lettres_, religious thought, and history writing, evidence for widespread literacy is utterly lacking in Judah during the time of the divided monarchy. Not a single trace of supposed tenth century Judahite literary activity has been found.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Another monumental confession. Scribes and mythmongers in plenty, but no literature to speak of to distinguish the "civilization" of Judah.<br><br>  <br>...monumental inscriptions and personal seals - essential signs of a fully developed state - appear in Judah only two hundred years after Solomon, in the late eighth century BCE.  <br>  <br>Nor is there any evidence for mass production of pottery in centralized workshops or industrial production of oil for export until the same late period.  <br>  <br>...archaeological surveys indicate that until the eighth century the population of the Judahite highlands was about one-tenth that of the highlands of the northern kingdom of Israel.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: But when Comyns Beaumont advanced the same facts, he was universally ridiculed and condemned. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Comyns_Beaumont) & [Here](http://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/comyns-beaumont-2.html) for more...)<br><br>  <br>In light of these findings, it is now clear that Iron Age Judah enjoyed no precocious golden age. David and his son Solomon and the subsequent members of the Davidic dynasty ruled over a marginal, isolated, rural region, with no signs of great wealth or centralized administration. It did not suddenly decline into weakness and misfortune from an era of unparalleled prosperity. Instead it underwent a long and gradual development over hundreds of years. David and Solomon’s Jerusalem was only one of a number of religious centers within the land of Israel; it was surely not acknowledged as the spiritual center of the entire people of Israel initially.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Or even more accurately, it's mostly events in a great _story_ finally being acknowledged as such.<br><br>  <br>Of the historical David we can say almost nothing, except to note the uncanny similarity between the ragtag Apiru bands that threatened Abdi-Heba and the biblical tales of the outlaw chief David and his band of mighty men roaming in the Hebron hills and the Judean desert. But whether or not David conquered Jerusalem in the daring Apiru-like raid described in the books of Samuel, it seems clear that the dynasty he established represented a change in rulers but hardly altered the basic way that the southern highlands were ruled.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: He existed alright, as the result of embroidery, embellishment and inflation.<br><br>  <br>**All this suggests that the institutions of Jerusalem - Temple and palace - did not dominate the lives of the rural population of Judah in anything close to the extent suggested by the biblical texts.**|---|

|---|**Priestly Condemnation Continues**  <br>some biblical scholars have suggested that this movement originated among dissident priests and prophets in the last days of the northern kingdom who were aghast at the idolatry and social injustice of the Assyrian period. After the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, they fled southward to promulgate their ideas.  <br>  <br>the passages in the books of Kings about the righteousness and sinfulness of the earlier kings of Judah reflects the ideology of the YHWH-alone movement.  <br>  <br>**God's Grace Shines on King Hezekiah**  <br>Faith in YHWH alone did not save Hezekiah’s territory against the wrath of the Assyrians. Large parts of Judah were devastated and valuable agricultural land in the Shephelah was given by the Assyrian victors to the city-states of Philistia. Judah’s territory shrank dramatically, Hezekiah was forced to pay a heavy tribute to Assyria, and a significant number of Judahites were deported to Assyria.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The Assyrians who invaded Israel and took the ten tribes into captivity, were once again _provoked_ by the king of the Judites. Hezekiah's irrational decisions brought the wrath of King Sennacherib down on his people. Meanwhile, Yahweh was nowhere to be found. It seems that the moment his back was turned, his priests, prophets and kings go insane. There's nothing humanly virtuous about them. Any good they do is due to God's will. That's a pretty picture of humankind.<br><br>  <br>Sennacherib fully achieved his goals: he broke the resistance of Judah and subjugated it. Hezekiah had inherited a prosperous state, and Sennacherib destroyed it.  <br>  <br>In the aftermath of the failed rebellion against Assyria, Hezekiah’s policy of religious purification and confrontation with Assyria must have seemed to many to have been a terrible, reckless mistake...Hezekiah’s blasphemous destruction of the venerated high places and his prohibition against worshiping Asherah, the stars, moon, and other deities along with YHWH that had brought such misfortune on the land.  <br>  <br>...when Hezekiah died and his twelve-year-old son Manasseh came to the throne, the religious pluralism in the (now considerably shrunken) countryside of Judah was restored.  <br>  <br>He (Manasseh) was described as the most sinful monarch that the kingdom of Judah had ever seen (2 Kings 21:3–7). In fact, the book of Kings puts the blame for the “future” destruction of Jerusalem on his head (2 Kings 21:11–15).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Manasseh threw his lot in with the Assyrians and became a vassal in their employ. He helped them mount an invasion on Egypt. In other words he was a traitor and opportunist. It's another example of Yahweh's failure.<br><br>  <br>Manasseh’s success in transforming Judah from the wasteland left by Sennacherib into a highly developed state in the Assyrian empire brought great wealth to some and social dislocation and uncertainty to many.  <br>  <br>Manasseh died in the year 642 BCE and was succeeded by his son Amon. According to the second book of Kings, Amon “did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasseh his father had done” (2 Kings 21: 20).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Another problem for omnipotent Yahweh. His earthly kingdom just can't get it right. (Note the Gaelic name _Amon_ or _Eamonn._)<br><br>  <br>**A New Enemy Arises**  <br>Assyria’s power continued to dwindle, and the ongoing Babylonian pressure on the heartland of the dying empire threatened to unbalance the ancient world and to endanger Egyptian interests in Asia. Egypt decided to intervene on the side of the Assyrians, and in 616 its army marched to the north. But this move did not stop the Assyrian collapse.  <br>  <br>The great Assyrian capital of Nineveh fell in 612, and the Assyrian court escaped to Haran in the west, an event that was recorded by the prophet Zephaniah (2: 13– 15).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: True to form, with the Babylonian threat of invasion looming, the Judite king, Josiah, manages to insult Pharaoh Necho, his ally, thereby losing his assistance in the great conflict to come. The Judite leaders certainly knew how to make enemies at the wrong time. Again, where was Yahweh?<br><br>  <br>The Deuteronomistic historian, who saw Josiah as a divinely anointed messiah destined to redeem Judah and lead it to glory was clearly at a loss to explain how such a historical catastrophe could occur and left only a curt, enigmatic reference to Josiah’s death. The dreams of this king and would-be messiah were brutally silenced at the hill of Megiddo. Decades of spiritual revival and visionary hopes seemingly collapsed overnight. Josiahwas dead and the people of Israel were again enslaved by Egypt.  <br>  <br>If this was not devastating enough, the following years brought even greater calamities. After the death of Josiah, the great reform movement apparently crumbled. The last four kings of Judah - three of them sons of Josiah - are negatively judged in the Bible, as apostates.  <br>  <br>**Babylonian Supremacy**  <br>Nebuchadnezzar crushed the Egyptian army at Carchemish in Syria (an event recorded in Jeremiah 46:2), causing the Egyptian forces to flee in panic back toward the Nile. With that defeat, the Assyrian empire was finally and irrevocably dismembered, and Nebuchadnezzar, now king of Babylon, sought to gain complete control over all the lands to the west.  <br>  <br>The Babylonian forces soon marched down the Mediterranean coastal plain, laying waste to the rich Philistine cities. In Judah, the pro-Egyptian faction that had taken over the Jerusalem court a few months after the death of Josiah was thrown into a panic - and their desperate appeals to Necho for military assistance against the Babylonians merely heightened their political vulnerability in the terrible days that lay ahead.  <br>  <br>The Babylonians were now intent on the plunder and complete devastation of the Judahite state.  <br>  <br>**The Jerusalem aristocracy and priesthood - among whom the Deuteronomistic ideology burned most passionately - were taken off into exile,**  <br>  <br>Four hundred years of Judah’s history came to an end in fire and blood. The proud kingdom of Judah was utterly devastated, its economy ruined, its society ripped apart. The last king in a dynasty that had ruled for centuries was tortured and imprisoned in Babylon. His sons were all killed. The Temple of Jerusalem - the only legitimate place for the worship of YHWH - was destroyed.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: In the sixth century the Jews were taken to Babylon in chains. remaining in captivity from 586 to 440 BC. Again, we are driven to ask why the chosen people suffered so. Or was it all a story? We're told there is archaeological evidence supporting biblical accounts. However, as we've seen, physical evidence usually paints a significantly different picture from what's found in scripture.<br><br>  <br>**Freedom**  <br>The mighty Neo-Babylonian empire crumbled and was conquered by the Persians in 539 BCE. In the first year of his reign, Cyrus, the founder of the Persian empire, issued a royal decree for the restoration of Judah and the Temple:  <br>  <br>A leader of the exiles named Sheshbazzar, described in Ezra 1:8 as “the prince of Judah” (probably indicating that he was a son of the exiled Davidic king Jehoiachin), led the first group of returnees to Zion.  <br>  <br>They reportedly carried with them the Temple treasures that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem half a century earlier. A list of returnees by town of origin, family, and number follows, about fifty thousand altogether. They settled in their old homeland and laid the foundations for a new Temple. A few years later another wave of returnees gathered in Jerusalem. Led by Jeshua the son of Jozadak and an apparent grandson of Jehoiachin named Zerubbabel, they built an altar and celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles.  <br>  <br>The construction of the Temple was then finished in the year 516 BCE.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So until the rebuilding of the second temple, the Israelites and Jews suffered attacks from Egyptians, Assyrians and Babylonians, enduring decades of captivity and the complete destruction of their cities, towns and villages. The Book of Deuteronomy, which describes most of this, isn't made up of a single coherent account. There are in fact _two_ separate accounts of the same events, and they do _not_ correspond. In any case, as the Bible relates, the end of all this tragedy was that the Davidic line peters out, leaving the _priests_ to assume complete dominion over the second temple and people of Judah.|---|

|---|**Jerusalem**  <br>Intensive excavations throughout Jerusalem have shown that the city was indeed systematically destroyed by the Babylonians.  <br>  <br>Both text and archaeology contradict the idea that between the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE and the return of the exiles after the proclamation of Cyrus in 538 BCE Judah was in total ruin and uninhabited.  <br>  <br>**Return to Judea**  <br>The lists of repatriates in Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7 amount to almost fifty thousand people.  <br>  <br>The edict of Cyrus the Great allowing a group of Judahite exiles to return to Jerusalem could hardly have been prompted by sympathy for the people remaining in Judah or for the suffering of the exiles. Rather, it should be seen as a well-calculated policy that aimed to serve the interests of the Persian empire.  <br>  <br>The Persians tolerated and even promoted local cults as a way to ensure the loyalty of local groups to the wider empire.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The account of the return beggars belief in some respects. The leaders of the Judites, Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel, were given permission to take back with them all the treasures that once decorated their first temple in Jerusalem. This is hard to believe, and sounds like a purely fictional account. Also, the Davidic monarchy had vanished with no explanation. It is inconceivable that the scribes and editors provided no explanation for this. We conclude that such a monarchy never existed i the first place, and that textual accounts of it were highly inflated. This is why it could easily be omitted later on, during the period of the return.<br><br>  <br>From this point onward, the Davidic family played no role in the history of Yehud. At the same time, the priesthood, which rose to a position of leadership in exile, and which also played an important role among those who had remained in Yehud, maintained its prominence because of its ability to preserve group identity. So in the following decades the people of Yehud were led by a dual system: politically, by governors who were appointed by the Persian authority and who had no connection to the Davidic royal family; religiously, by priests...This was one of the most crucial turning points in Jewish history.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Why then, in the New Testament, do we have such an emphasis on Jesus being related to the lineage of David, which, if it existed at all, had been well and truly obliterated?<br><br>  <br>_I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star_ - Rev 22:16  <br>  <br>**Who Wrote the Scriptures?**  <br>One of the main functions of the priestly elite in post-exilic Jerusalem - beyond the conduct of the renewed sacrifices and purification rituals - was the continuing production of literature and scripture to bind the community together and determine its norms against the peoples all around.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Finally the crux of the matter and the book. Finally, the lines that put us straight on the true reason for the Old Testament and its bizarre content. Can one still treat the document as sincerely composed "history?" Or is it more rational to jettison that idea and regard it as a work of fiction? Another explanation is that the priests of Jerusalem, after the restoration of their authority, took actual histories and redacted them with numerous fictional elements. This is, in any case, a reprehensible and unforgivable liberty. Experts agree that the Pentateuch was altered during this precise time. This act of "giving shape" to the history of Judah is considered by modern scholars to be a _good_ thing. By apportioning no blame to the mythmongers, and underwriting their infernal industry, modern scholars also become suspect in the minds of unbiased rational people. If the editors of the texts weren't interested in the evidence, why should later readers be interested in it? If the fictional elements were their chief interest, it is those fictional elements that we are bound to highlight and assess. It makes all the difference that Yahweh is fictional rather than real, the product of deceptive self-righteous minds incapable of establishing any kind of civilization comparable to that of their neighbors. After exiting from the high civilization of Babylon, the desperate desert wanderers were of a mind to aggrandize themselves, and did so to preposterous heights. Their desert god had to be inflated into a giant balloon-animal, casting all other gods into shade. Their people had to be a specially chosen elect, standing above all other nations. That is why we are _not_ dealing with actual history when we read the Hebrew testament. We're dealing with the wish-fulfilments of madmen. And let us not forget the fate of geniuses such as John Allegro who, after correctly sussing the truth, attempted to expose the skeins of priestly deception.<br><br>  <br>Yehud remained in the hands of the Persians for two centuries, until the conquest of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Right. So even after their release, the Judites do not get to rule their own kingdom for 200 years or more. They remain vassals of the Persian Empire. Great going Yahweh. What do your sorry people have to do to win your favor? They return home to Judea, but are _not_ completely free. Was their celebrated fealty to Yahweh really sane? Or was it simply pathological and obsessive?<br><br>  <br>**Herodian Period**  <br>In the first century BCE, as the Hasmonean kings, of the Maccabean lineage, eventually declined into dynastic squabbling and the Roman client-king Herod took power in Judea, the Bible emerged as the uniting force and scriptural heart of a hard-pressed community.  <br>  <br>**Second Temple Destroyed**  <br>With the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and the rise of Christianity, the independent power of the Bible as a formative constitution - not just a brilliant work of literature or a collection of ancient law and wisdom - proved itself.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Despite the chosen people's loyalty to their desert god, things don't get any better for them. When the Maccabean nobility attempted to eradicate the Judite priests and set up a new Jewish monarchy, it incites chaos and eventually fails miserably. The Alexandrian Period of rule finally gave way to that of Rome and still conflict continued, with Yahweh's advise proving useless. So maniacal are the Jews that tolerant Rome is finally forced to impose martial law. Rome's patience runs out, and the second temple is plundered and destroyed. Of three million inhabitants, one million are killed and thousands are arrested and ruined. The trappings of the second temple - the ark, menorah, torah and so on - are seized and transported under guard to Rome. Judea is set alight, and the Jews are scattered to the four corners of the earth. So much for Yahweh the great.<br><br>   <br>_In 70 AD, the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed its population. Fearing that scattering the Jews over the earth might cause their ancient records to become lost led to the formation of a council of rabbis who met in Jamnia about the beginning of the second century AD, for the purpose of codifying the holy records and giving them permanent form_ - Ernest Busenbark  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The aftermath of the Roman destruction of Judea and sacking of the second temple saw a mass outcry _against_ Yahweh. Thousands of Jews, some from senior position in society and the priesthood, loudly rebuked and rejected their desert god for abandoning them in times of trouble, not just once but on dozens of critical occasions. It was at this time that thousands of Jews converted to Paganism, Occultism, Kabalism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism and other non-Jewish sects. Jewish atheism can also be traced to this time when rational men finally said _no_ to the priests and their absurd religion. Many of the new breed lived and prospered in large cities such as Alexandria. They excelled financially and intellectually, forming many occult societies. They were particularly influential in cities such as Salonika. Those who fled from ruined Judea to Sura and Pumbetita in Babylon, formed the so-called Gaonate, an secret society comprising elite Pharisees and Sadducees, the latter group descended from the Sons of Zadok, allegedly one of Judaism's earliest priesthoods, dating from before their time among the Atonists of Egypt. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sura_Academy) & [Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HI1KIE/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i7) for more...)<br><br>  <br>_Many of the Israelites seem to have considered Jahveh to be a mere tribal god, holding supreme power over them but powerless against their enemies_ - Ernest Busenbark  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So adamant and fierce was this outrage against Jehovah and his priests that Jews en masse converted to other sects and religions. Sadly, this allowed the later mythmongers of the New Testament a perfect platform from which to condemn Jews for deserting God, and being unfaithful and heretical. The monstrosities, like Paul and others, continually presented Jews in a less than favorable light, never mentioning the countless reasons for the Jewish position, or the numerous instances of Jehovah's failure and absence. The Christian was cunningly cast as loyal, obedient and deserving of God's covenant and love, whereas Old Testament Jews were vilified as disloyal, unworthy and incorrigibly disobedient. The mythmongers didn't miss a trick.|---|

|---|**Conclusion**  <br>We see that when it comes to the content of the Hebrew Bible it is impossible to tell history from fiction. It is absolutely impossible for us to decide which passage and anecdote speaks of things that actually happened or whether they are part of an elaborately crafted mythos created by priestly mythmongers. It boggles the mind to think that a compendium of _folktales_ has been taken for reality and holy writ for so many centuries. It confounds the mind to think it's all been accepted due to two millennia of infernal deception and oppressive mind-control.  <br>  <br>Finkelstein & Silberman provide evidence in plenty, showing that the well-known events recorded in Hebrew Bible are little more than lurid fictions which senior scholars know must not be taken as hard evidence for the existence of any character or event presented in the scriptures. These earth-shattering revelations - presaged by earlier forgotten geniuses - haven't reached the general public. They might never do so, which will be a great pity.  <br>  <br>We see that these revelations utterly vindicate the work of men such as Comyns Beaumont and L. A. Waddell. But of course, the average Jew and Christian hasn't heard of these alternative scholars, and have nowhere to turn if and when the foundations of their religions crumble. They are left in quiet a void. We on the other hand are not. We have something to put in the place of whatever is removed. We have the work of Prof. Thompson and previous masters who knew we were being handed a litany of lies.  <br>  <br>Discovering the lie-machinery of the rabbis and clergy paves the way for the truth about ancient times to finally come forth. Now we can begin to seriously consider the role of Astro-Theology and Sidereal Mythology. We can assess where the stories presented in scriptures actually came from. We can assess whether they pertain to _earlier_ races, such as those referenced by Prof. Waddell and others. We can finally ask whether the great priestly orders mentioned in the Pentateuch were not in fact descendants of the High Arya, whose history fell by the wayside, to be replaced by a tissue of egregious pious frauds and outright lies. We can reassess the role of mightier nations from whom Jewish "history" was appropriated; those of Egypt, Persia, Phoenicia, Sumeria, Chaldea, Babylon, Mycenae, Crete, Greece, Anatolia, and places further west. (For example, the Book of Deuteronomy is suggestively similar in form and style to Grecian literature.)  <br>  <br>Bear in mind that according to tradition the Jews were a nation _set apart_ from all others, special and ever so holy. But where do we find _evidence_ of this uniqueness? What if it was a trait not of Jews but of the Aryan founders of other Middle Eastern civilizations? What if it were the trait of even earlier divinely-inspired races? Are we dealing, as Beaumont insists, with the wholesale appropriation and ransacking of lost Western traditions stretching back to prediluvian Atlantis? We'll be in no place to find out if we continue believing the falsehoods of Christian and Jewish mythmongers.  <br>  <br>Fortunately, as this book shows, their narrative is coming apart at the seams. It has been happening for a while, certainly since the beginning of the twentieth century. Consequently, the unraveling of Judeo-Christianity must be monitored constantly, since deception is still the order of the day. Hence the reason for this website.  <br>  <br>Clearly, the content of the Old Testament was composed by people recently expelled from the great civilization of Egypt. Despite their hatred of Egypt, they were clearly enamored with the august temples of their sophisticated hosts. Such was the impression made by the colossi of the Nile, that it spurred Israelite mythmongers to replicate the grandeur _in writing._ Envying the expertize and majesty of Egypt, they wished to recast _themselves_ as characters in a _fictional_ simulacrum of it. The Old Testament is the result of this somewhat justified exercise in parody and appropriation. The dusty beggars of Israel desperately wanted to be monarchs of the world, and finally became so in their own sickly imaginations.  <br>  <br>Finkelstein and Silberman, and academics of their kind, downplay the damage done by ancient mythmongers, saying that their skillful fictionalizations and literary genius _excuses_ their deceptive intent. I do not take this view at all, and deeply object to those who do. The job of the early scribes was to chronicle actual events in plain unembroidered language. This they did not do. Instead they created a fiction _posing_ as fact, making them consummate propagandists, myth-makers and liars.  <br>  <br>Although it has taken centuries to unravel their skeins of deception and uncover the occulted truth about Judaism and Christianity, there's no turning back. Their campaign of lies has not succeeded, and the rational unbiased person now has access to the truth. We can now vindicate the greats of times past - the Masseys, Taylors, Beaumonts and Waddells, etc - who labored in the dark without recompense to bring forth truths hidden for so long. It is they who solely deserve the title "divine."|---|
