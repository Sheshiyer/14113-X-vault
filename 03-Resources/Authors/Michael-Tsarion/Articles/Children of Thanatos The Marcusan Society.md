_That man can be a slave even without being put in chains is of crucial importance in our situation today_ - Erich Fromm  

Give people freedom when they don’t really want it, and see what happens. Allow them to fully explore and express their sexuality and observe what they do.  
  
Strangely, instead of improving society, your "liberated" specimens turn against it in favor of infantile debauchery. Why?  
   
Answers are far and few between unless we intend going deeply into psychology. But even a little inquiry reveals that most people do not really want freedom. Subconsciously, they prefer to be _unfree_ and told what to do and think.  
  
So what’s the use of being able to wallow in the excesses of “free love” if I’m so bioenergetically armored and genitally insensitive that I’m unable to experience any kind of sexual or emotional satisfaction?  
  
Since I can’t admit this to myself or anyone else, I adopt a socially acceptable mask and pretend it's all good.  I dress the part, adopt the pose of a drop-out and malcontent, and parrot the political slogans favored by perverted super-wealthy Socialist demagogues.  
   
Hey, don’t knock it…it works.

How can such an armored character recognize his own emotional plague? How can the self-poisoned man’s thinking heal his society of its derangement?  
  
For all his efforts, this type may succeed only in increasing the world’s problems. Given that such a do-gooder is deeply toxic in mind and body, isn’t he likely to choose leaders who share his pathological state of being?  
  
The key to progress in our world lies in the realization that psychically mutilated people are completely incapable of seeing themselves as sick and wrongheaded. It’s just not possible.  
  
Secondly, it is crucial that the sane person discovers the _true_ reasons for his fellow’s deranged state, which can’t happen unless he's willing to delve deeply into the subject of psychology.  
  
The man who refuses to do so, aids and abets his fellow’s sickness, and becomes party to the crimes they commit politically and socially.  
  
The mutilated person’s first crime is committed against _themselves_. Psychology acknowledges this and attempts to provide tools for insight into the problem. Politics works antithetically, directing attention away from the inner republic to the outer theater of events. The promise that the world can be improved via political action is very captivating, especially for those suffering from _psychophobia_ - hatred of their own Selves.  
  
Generally the vast majority of people entering politics are themselves psychologically unworked. In many cases they are hedonists, narcissists, obsessives, hyper-extroverts and collectivists. By now it should be obvious to everyone that political action only causes more social fallout. It provides a platform for morally inferior types overjoyed to find out that they never need relate to themselves as Selves again.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/girpower.jpg?1598469394)

This type’s deep aversion to Selfhood leads them to support political paradigms such as radical liberalism, feminism, communism, communitarianism and collectivism. The ideologues behind these movements wish to reduce people to mere machines, preaching as they do doctrines of equality, social justice, pluralism and multiculturalism, etc.  
  
Thinkers from the Frankfurt School, such as Herbert Marcuse, decided to further the heinous "equalization" of Western man by uniting communitarian political models with Freudian psychology. Although their designs for world control would never have been endorsed by the ultra-conservative Freud, the Marcusans were inspired by works such as _Civilization and its Discontents,_ and particularly by Freud’s ruminations on the struggle within the psyche between the impulses for regression and advancement.  
  
According to Freud, civilizations and societies come about due to an uneasy stalemate between the instincts of life and death (Eros and Thanatos). Basically, human consciousness and behavior are directed by the search for pleasure and the avoidance of pain. The Marcusans decided to co-opt this basal tendency and use it as a tool for building the utopian society they wish to see replace Western civilization.  
  
The Marcusan plan was to establish a society based on the Pleasure Principle. They believed they were following the course of history, and that their dream was quite rational.  
  
Success was assured as long as one systematically removed obstacles causing distress, want and injustice. Hence the welfare dependent “Nanny States" that now proliferate throughout Europe and America. Hence the endless supply of bread and circuses and "good times" had by all.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/marcuse.jpg?1598469388)

Neo-Marxist mastermind Herbert Marcuse (1898-1979), set out to upgrade Marxism which had pathetically failed to restructure the world. His fundamental premise was quite simple - people want endless pleasure, so give it to them. They'll light candles to your memory and remain obedient acolytes for all eternity. Find out what it is they'll suffer agonies to achieve, and you've got the building blocks of the perfect society - the perfect surrogate womb.  

According to Freud, and his legitimate followers, the welfare state is an abomination. Its advocates have no interest in universal suffrage or good of humanity. How could they? Their society strips a person of any sense of personal responsibility, and works to undermine Selfhood by implying that one need not heroically aspire to attain what they want. On the contrary, the message is that one is _not_ worthy of the necessities of life.  
  
It’s not voiced this way of course, but the message subconsciously received is that if you are not capable of managing your own life, and willing to set out and heroically attain what you desire – by way of learning and work – it doesn’t matter. It will be provided for you by those who know what you need, those who truly care for your comfort and well-being.  
  
In other words the Marcusan society not only considers you an incompetent dependent loser whose only hope in life is to obey the all-powerful State, as it stands as place-holder for the tribal Totemic Father.  
  
No matter that Freud’s own teachings, pessimistic as they are in parts, stress that man _does_ experience pain willingly when he consciously delays gratification in order to realize _future_ desires, and that this comportment is the necessary beginning of heroism in all its permutations.  
  
This crucial psychological function was ignored by Marcusans for two reasons. First, they are themselves not given to delaying gratification, being infants in adult bodies. And secondly, because they wish to reduce all humankind to a level of polymorphous perversity, in which the capacity for delayed gratification expires. Their chief ally in this act of regression is the media, which has worked for decades to infantilize the masses.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/springer.jpg?1587225816)

_Never missed an episode!_  

As I show elsewhere, for this inhuman agenda to succeed it was essential that the true teachings of Freud were defaced and downplayed. It was imperative that the works of Reich, Rank, Groddeck, Jung and other savants were ridiculed and dismissed in favor of behaviorism and neuroscience.  
  
It was also imperative that the psychology of children and women be studied and the findings utilized in the process of universal infantilization.  
  
Not only did the Frankfurt gang and their satellites study the classic Freudian “Oedipal” stages which occur between 2 and 7 years of age, but they also honed-in on the so-called "Semiotic" stage occurring directly after birth.  
  
The pre-symbolic phase is vitally important, given that it provides the base for later stages of biopsychic development. It is at this semiotic stage that a newborn infant experiences a great deal of emotional conflict. The infant quite rightly shuns the light of reality, and desires a return to the womb. This desire for a womblike environment lies at the base of everyone’s consciousness, and Marcuse knew it.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/momchild.jpg?1598469373)

On the Semiotic level a mother loses her identity in her child, while the child's consciousness becomes an extension of hers. It is at this early stage that a child's identity (or self-schema) can be compromised and permanently overwritten. All in the name of love, of course.  

Taking their inspiration from Freud and Rank, Marcuse and crew devised their master-plan. Not only does their human manikin desire to avoid pain and experience nothing but pleasure, but his _ultimate_ source of pleasure lies in his desire for a _return_ to the mother’s womb. Since this is physically impossible, those under the spell of this regressive instinct, settle for the next best thing – immersion in the _surrogate_ womb. Promise a man this haven and he falls, body and soul, right into your hands.  
  
Not only will a man delay gratification in order to attain _this_ chimera, he’ll willingly suffer anything handed to him by reality. Simply put, he’ll suffer endlessly in the name of the great pleasure promise.  
  
Actually, as Marcuse knew, what happens is that characterologically speaking, the regressive type becomes _feminized_. If all effort invested isn’t for a heroic purpose, then it’s not _truly_ masculine and doesn’t serve progress at all. It doesn’t aim toward some Omega Point, where creative aspirations and transcendence are achieved, and doesn’t facilitate some abstract Hegelian process by which man achieves complete Self-transparency. It builds only to see all structures eventually fall.  
  
The pain versus pleasure theory was well and truly appropriated by the Marcusan utopians. All one has to do is reformulate society along regressive feminized lines.  
  
Design towns and cities to replicate a womblike environment. Be sure to have women duly placed in as many positions of authority as possible, particularly those of a leftist liberalized consciousness and outlook. Be sure to program them to define themselves as the “be all and end all” of life. Convince them that _their_ ways and outlooks are sane and preferable. Assure them they don’t require masculine men in their lives, and that the State will cater to all their survival needs. Establish societies and institutions based on _their_ preferences, and allow them to purge masculine (men-admiring) women from their midst. Be sure they raise their daughters to despise men, and their boys to be ashamed of their sex.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/demonic.jpg?1587192028)

_Man, the source of all our troubles._ No matter that _all_ men are born of woman, and that their characters and outlooks are largely dependent on their mother's influence. Too bad that the last thing of interest to most women is female psychology.  

The Marcusans not only know a great deal about semiotic consciousness, but also about the dynamics of the so-called Dragon Fight, as I refer to it. They know that this endemic conflict can be manipulated to serve _their_ purposes.  
  
Through various perfidious television programs they’ve ensured that the mother-daughter conflict serves to bolster their inhuman agendas. Programs are scripted to imply the benefits of homosexuality, hedonism and outright perversity. The scenario of lesbian affairs strongly awakens regressive tendencies, and permits headlong immersion in the semiotic level, in which craving for the restoration of the womb-state is strongest.

_It's all politically correct, okay!_  

The "alternative" sexual culture is based not on freedom but its lack. The superficial, hyperactive, armored type becomes promiscuous and exhibitionist because they do _not_ experience genital release. Unaware of the cause - and seduced by a perverse media - many women start believing that men are the problem, and go in search of more satisfying experiences with members of their own sex. When all parties come up empty, they burn with bioenergetic frustration. In their intolerable agitation - caused by pelvic block and genital armoring - they turn to _political_ activism which allows them to vent pent up energy. This is the reason for the ridiculous fads of "Girl Power" and feminist "liberation" movements, etc.  It explains why sincere empathic human contact wanes to nothing, why families and homes disintegrate, and why depression, anxiety and criminality are on the rise. Eventually, the necrophilous Crowd of self-hating types demand their government provide the causes and crusades needed to exorcise psychosexual frustration. Big Brother is only too happy to oblige. The will of the mob is their command. Before long, it is via political activity and intellectual stimulation that armored types reach "orgasm."  

As I point out elsewhere, the phenomenon of Crowd Consciousness is yet another social manifestation of the surrogate womb. Likewise, many social events also serve to awaken atavistic and semiotic instincts. These include large scale get-togethers such as occurs at Woodstock and Burning Man, etc.  
  
Let us remember that all political theaters also work for this same purpose. Wherever masses of people – particularly of a leftist persuasion – congregate, atavistic instincts are stirred and stimulated. Gatherings of these highly disturbed "Red Fascists" are commonplace and highly funded. Indeed, there is always some facile contrived cause or crusade to herd them into cluster-mode. The psychologically insightful person isn’t duped by the window-dressing and absurd slogans. They concentrate instead on the unseen lures snagging the will of the Crowd.

_Orgasm in the streets...Yes We Can!_  

The libido leaked by the orgiastic masses, in pursuit of their whimsical causes and crusades, serves the architects well. This is because it finally leads to exhaustion, after which the participants are _highly_ suggestible.  
  
Bioenergetically and psychosexually, it is known that liberal-minded types are _less_ energized and driven than their conservative nemesis. This is because, as said, their will is directed toward _non-masculine_ goals. It is also quickly exhausted by the revelry offered by the histrionic Crowd.  
  
Personally, members of the Thugocracy find themselves unable to tap into the deep reservoir of bioenergy needed for the long haul. Their body-armoring prevents this. The absence of gas in the tank accounts for the thugocrat's shallow thinking and emotional inexpressiveness. It's a symptom of their _emotional plague_, which, via Crowd Consciousness serves to poison the Mitwelt (society).  
   
_The modern mass man is isolated and lonely, even though he is part of a crowd; he has no convictions which he could share with others, only slogans and ideologies he gets from the communications media_ – Erich Fromm  
  
Actually, as Reicheans Ellsworth Baker and Charles Konia show, liberalism in most forms was already redundant after it served to expose the frauds and injustices of Christianity. By the late seventeenth century, instead of dying off, it searched for a new whipping boy, a new target, which it found in politics and sociology. Not that common working men were behind this reorientation. They couldn’t care less. It was the “intellectuals” who signed on for liberalism’s secular causes. It has been college campus intellectual fruitcakes who’ve witlessly pushed liberalism’s battering ram ever since, crashing through as many gates and doors as they can find.  
  
The adroit Marcusans realized this early on, drawing up the manuals for social unrest. Since Marxism as a philosophy proved utterly inadequate, the Marcusans conceived of “Cultural Marxism” as a means of recruiting hordes of armored and bioenergetically poisoned middle-class malcontents and transgressives out to change the world.  
  
This middle-class Thugocracy doesn’t notice or care that their sick ideology is based on pure negation. Using terms such as “relativism” doesn’t fool insightful people. Their social criticism is bankrupt from the start, since everything is criticized _except_ the critic and his beliefs. The critical theorist sets up a cycle of negation in which he is permitted to critique everything but _himself_. Should he apply the corrosive of critique to himself, he ceases to exist.  
  
The critical theorist succeeds only in criticizing everything he doesn’t like, something we normally do most of the time. Therefore, his philosophy is no philosophy at all. It's based on whim, bias, opinion and plain sense data. It’s _not_ philosophy, it's dogma. Specifically, it is pure fascism and authoritarianism,  entirely dependent on one’s necrophilous need for self-negation, immersion and collectivism.  
  
In effect, it is simply an extension of Mob Rule. It’s Thugocracy gone wild. Do as _we_ say, or die! Emphasis on the “we.”  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/derangement.jpg?1598465350)

The Crowd is an institution, the most evil ever known.  

So it goes with today’s highly-funded Thugocrats. They are capable only of negation, cynicism, irrationality and destructiveness. Consumed in doubt about everything real and true, they finally implode in a puff of self-negation.  
  
Nothing _means_ anything, right? Certainly, nothing within me means anything, no innate thoughts or feelings. I exist only because I’m _told_ what to think and feel by external forces, of which I know little. _Hell  yeah!_  
  
The Marcusans also drew on the philosophy of history as espoused by German philosopher Georg Hegel. Hegel spoke about an omega point toward which all humanity moves. Indeed, the whole of the universe, human and non-human, intends toward it. Without this august movement of mind or spirit (Logos or Geist), what we know as "society" is, as a phenomenon, unthinkable.  
  
We see then that for Hegel, life is not simply about avoiding pain and craving pleasure. It's about discovering the reasons for pain and suffering, and moving ever forward, intellectually and emotionally, to a moment of complete awareness, Self-transparency and equilibrium.  
  
_...all evolution can be described as the process of differentiation of the part from the whole, the individual from the mass, with the parts then relating to each other on a higher level_ – Rollo May  

[![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/editor/hegel.jpg?1587191933)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_dialectic)

German philosopher Georg Hegel (1770-1831). His profound ideas were scurrilously appropriated and defaced by Marx, Marcuse, and other Materialist thinkers.  

In terms of human relationships and society, Hegel spoke of the original brute state he described as the Master versus Slave opposition. However, stated Hegel, although all human encounters start on a crude level, through historical time they gradually evolve and become more empathic and sophisticated.  
   
His schemata was of great interest to the Marcusan social engineers who, like Karl Marx before them, cannibalized Hegel's profound ideas, bending them to suit their own inhuman ideology.  
  
Marcuse took it for granted that the Master-Slave dynamic existed, although his ideas on its evolution and transcendence differed drastically from Hegel's holistic progressive premise. Marcuse wasn’t interested in any developing sophistication. That was some phantom of Western civilization, and meant all sorts of bad things.  
  
When it came to Hegel's philosophy, Marcuse’s "Rousseauean" petticoats were clearly on display.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/marxheg.jpg?1598469306)

Karl Marx, like Marcuse after him, defaced Hegel's profound ideas, to concoct his so-called philosophy of Dialectical Materialism. Marxism as a philosophy finally foundered, and all Marx's theories proved false. In fact, the direction of history took an opposite turning than that professed by the deluded poser. Instead of abandoning Marx's discredited ideas, Marcuse, with others from the Frankfurt School, devised Cultural Marxism, and began what they refer to as a long march through the institutions. Their absurd philosophy aims at converting the youth to the overarching project - namely, the destruction of Western civilization.  

Basically, Hegelian progress transmutes the Master-Slave opposition, culminating in _true_ equality. Of course this teaching was inverted by the Marcusans who wanted to maintain and even upgrade conflict between people. How else could civilization be undermined?  
  
The Frankfurt School's secret agenda is to extol the need for _external_ social harmony, while working to fragment and disorient the _inner_ republic of the individual. It's done in a way that elicits the victim's complete collusion.  
  
The goal of _all_ Marxists is to obliterate Western culture in favor or any other cultural form or model their degenerate minds can conceptualize. Capitalism must be undermined at all costs. Healthy human engagement and competition leading to higher sophistication _must_ be derailed. Conversely, the success of Capitalism means the utter failure of neo-Marxist subversion.  
  
Reading Hegel revealed to the Marcusan transgressives that the more people interact on rational grounds, the more they are able to compete and heroically aspire. The more they surpass the Master-Slave relationship, the more they move beyond the clutches of Communitarians. This _natural_ evolution of society had to be sabotaged.  
  
Consequently, the political Left was used as a Trojan Horse by the Marcusans. Well-meaning liberal-minded intellectuals were targeted and a great deal of effort put into the secondment of women whose consciousness oversees the pre-Oedipal _semiotic_ stages of infant development.  
  
Additionally, the systematic inhibition of relational sophistication - and regression to the Master versus Slave conflict - entails the loss of empathy, not only socially but personally_._  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/editor/obamanog.jpg?1587189561)

The plan to disrupt empathic resonance and connectivity is succeeding. The interpersonal and personal meltdown seen around us in the world today has its roots in this deliberate Marcusan subversion. The world’s political demagogues are merely low-level deputies overseeing the implementation of Marcusan poison.  
  
The media has been directed to not only titillate the senses, but heighten our craving for sexual satiation. As said above, the problem is that the armored person soon finds himself in great confusion and distress. Hastening to participate in the sexual revolution, and drown himself in a culture of “free love,” he fails for all his efforts to achieve sexual satori.  
  
This is according to the Marcusan plan. The _unsatisfied_ man - in a miasma of inner turmoil -  falls into his controller's hands without resistance. His libido is now theirs to direct.  
  
Via the media, the hyper-sexualized but deeply unsatisfied person is steered toward this and that _political_ cause. He is so pent up that he willingly seeks out any inane inhuman cause or pastime. He is so bioenergetically agitated and ravenous that he can no longer master himself. Ruled by the Pleasure Principle, he becomes a disciple of hedonism, signing on for any and every kind of cult activity promising bioenergetic release.  
  
Hence the proliferation not only of sports channels and events, but of much more sinister organizations seducing intellectuals into their webs. Even those who do not go down these roads still require an inordinate amount of banal distraction and titillation. To suppress natural feeling, more and more people turn to alcohol and drugs. Addiction to pornography as well as outright criminal activity are also indicative of this libidinous instability.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/gaga3.jpg?1598469296)

The media's sexual titillation continues unabated. However, the armored personality type lacks genuine biotic feeling, and rarely experiences sexual release during sexual activity. Restless and chronically unsatisfied, he learns to hate his body. He prefers to numb himself so he is able to withstand the onslaught of pornographic images assaulting his mind. As part of his compulsive need for distraction - and due to his considerable somatic agitation - he seeks intellectual pastimes. Political crusades appear increasingly attractive to him. Political sects which subtextually promise a surrogate womb experience - and return to the semiotic stage - prove seductive and irresistible.  
  
Marcuse won the day. By pushing for a sexually uninhibited culture, he knew what would happen. The armored regressive type is bound to be drowned in frustration and emotional plague. In a self-induced fit of wild anger and hatred, he turns against reality. As his consciousness succumbs to limbic influences, he becomes increasingly cynical, defiant, inhuman and criminal.  

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/masterslave.jpg?1598469289)

Failure to develop higher levels of sophistication in relation to the Mitwelt inevitably endangers society. As Marcuse knew all too well, it awakens the regressive tendency within the psyche, which returns us to the raw Master versus Slave rivalry. What happens on the individual level can also occur on the social level. The Marcusans hope that Western civilization will be undermined by the regressive urges of the highly dissociated sense-infatuated masses.

Alternatively, to soothe his psychosexual frustration, the victim of emotional plague may choose to follow a New Age sect. He may join a religious cult, taking a vow of celibacy. More likely, he'll simply depend on mind-altering drugs to escape his malaise.  
  
If his derangement leads him to a wholesale denial of his body, he will be attracted to idiotic “Gnostic” belief systems which appear holy because they subtextually promise a return to the sanctuary of the womb or its surrogate. He becomes a Gnostic as soon as he conceives of  sexuality as something loathsome and devilish.  
  
In this highly pathological state, he not only signs on for _asceticism_ (body- and world-denying religious beliefs), but also for Socialist political systems which preach that the individual isn’t as important as “the party” or “humanity.”  
  
This hardening of armoring and denial of the body’s needs, gives rise to the Authoritarian Personality Type who, in denying his own somatic needs, certainly doesn’t fret about denying _you_ what you require.  
  
It is true to say, then, that the Socialist is definitely the more armored personality type, and most psychically deranged. In the end, as a addicted sado-masochist, he can only find pleasure in pain and by inflicting pain on others.  

[![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/published/frauddereida.jpg?1598469281)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida)

Marcuse's evil twin, French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930-2004). His so-called philosophy amounts to little more than everyday criticism of what one already _dislikes_. Like Marcuse, Derrida was directed to draft the manuals of subversion for the instruction of socially subversive types. In 1980, the fraud was awarded an honorary doctorate by Columbia University despite worldwide outrage. Even dozens of  top thinkers were unable to stop the fiasco. Derrida's well-known anti-Western bias contaminated millions of young intellectuals. As far as Derrida and co were concerned, if it's Western and white, it's worthless. Their _Postmodern_ world must be understood as a world without males and whites.  

In the early stages of his regressive process, the thugocratic personality type can wear all the beads, bangles, tie-dyes and Afghan coats he wants, but it means nothing. He only continues the process of life-long self-deception. And just because a million other campus malcontents do likewise doesn’t make it any less grotesque.  
  
_The notion that mental health is to be equated with social adaptability is worse than false; it is actively dangerous; it encourages the development of mental illness_ - Nathaniel Branden  
  
The campus revolutionary’s psyche is poisoned by hyper-intellectualization and obsession with _political_ change. He’s not inclined to feel, and due to his armored state he _can’t_ feel. Empathy is practically non-existent. Therefore, his social aspirations are purely delusional and compensatory. They mask his inner vacuity and inhumanity. Despite mouthing pathetic slogans about the “We, Us and Our,” he's totally indifferent to Being.  
  
Underlying his political persona lies his pathological resistance to Eros (life and libido), and his antipathy to the world that drags him further away from the womb. What he wants is uroboric immersion and oblivion, and he believes only in political systems promising to lead him to it.

![Picture](https://www.dragonmother.org/uploads/9/5/2/3/95235006/editor/everybody.jpg?1587191888)

_Hey, why be yourself when you can be everyone?_  

Let’s return to the original premise. As far as Herbert Marcuse and crew were concerned, the post-Nietzschean world offered man more pleasure than he ever knew before in history. This means that there is less reason for man to despair, worry or introspect. He has less reason to bring meaning from within himself. Everything he needs, craves and wants is being gifted to him and his fellows by the outside world. All he need do is reach out and take it. He might need to show a little conformity and not rock the boat. Should he want to act out like an infant on a tantrum, the orgiastic permissive society _permits_ him to do so. But as he tires, he soon submits his will to that of his beneficent Providers.  
  
Abnegating his will and turning away from his true natural needs, he need not bother with conscience and morality. He can just do what he’s told to secure everything he requires. Abandoning vocation for recreation, he soon finds himself elated at being relieved of Selfhood.  
   
In this new gleaming utopia, if problems exist, personally or socially, science is sure to deal with it.  
  
Psychiatrists too are on the ball. They know that primary neurosis is caused by our disconnection from the womb-environment and hankering for a return to uroboric immersion. They know we enter the social world as _discontents_, and that we are secretly children of Thanatos (death). They know we seek the ultimate pleasure not in consciousness but in its opposite. We seek the peace of oblivion, and they’re out to give it to us in the form of their endless supply of Happy Pills for every occasion.  
  
_There was a time when rational present-day consciousness had not yet separated from the historical psyche, the collective unconscious_ – Carl Jung  
   
_Consciousness is a very recent acquisition of nature, and it is still in an “experimental state.” It is frail, menaced by specific dangers, and easily injured. As anthropologists have noted, one of the most common mental derangements that occur among primitive people is what they call “the loss of a soul”_ - ibid  
  
In short, today’s Dionysian establishment simply hands people what they want most. They know we are highly antagonistic to the Reality Principle, and crave all sorts of inane distractions and pastimes in order to lessen its effect on our lives. The oblivion they offer frees us from the pressure of being independent Selves and exercising our Will to Meaning.  
  
The “relativism” purveyed by Marcusans isn’t anything substantial or real. In fact, it’s based on negation of the real. Absolutes, virtues and values don’t exist. And that’s it. No further argument. The only reality, the only truth, so to speak, is pure negation. The more one negates, the more one is “free.” It’s a doctrine with millions of converts.  
  
We're not told that this kind of "freedom" is simply regression and autism. It's the result of being plunged back into the Pleasure Principle where reality is replaced by polymorphously perverse pre-genital semiotic consciousness.  
  
Modern man’s compulsive need for external authority turns him to stone. His embodiment of the master’s will makes him psychically rigid or armored. His capitulation to their vile rule occurs chiefly because he inhabits the profoundly anti-psychological age of _their_ making.  
  
Lack of Shadow-Work means he becomes more and more armored as years go by. This self-abnegation soon turns into complete autophobia or self-hate. From this point he must stabilize his ego by way of society. He must do as others do, and follow society’s demagogues wherever they lead. To think and act independently is his worst possible offense. Sure, he has the _illusion_ of freedom, the window-dressing by which he fools himself and his hyperactive fellows. But the fact is that he’d fall to pieces without the Totemic Father before whom he bows and submits his will.  
  
_Turn your eyes inward, look into your own depths, learn first to know yourself! Then you will understand why you were bound to fall ill; and perhaps you will avoid falling ill in future_ – Sigmund Freud  
   
By avoiding Shadow Work and turning away from _inner_ archetypal guides and teachers, modern man offers up his soul to the disciples of Thanatos, working to give him exactly what he desires most – _oblivion_.
