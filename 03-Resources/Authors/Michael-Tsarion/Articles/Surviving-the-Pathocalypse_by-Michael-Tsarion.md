## The Hidden Epidemic

Robert Hare, Harvey Checkley, Martha Stout, and other psychiatrists, tell us that one in twenty-five people are sociopathic personality types. Other experts think this is a low estimate. They are right.

This is because we're talking about *full-blown* sociopaths. What about the person who is 75 percent sociopathic? What about the man or woman who is 50 percent deranged, or 15 percent? Add them all together and we're way beyond a demographic of one in twenty-five.

Add to these the common-or-garden varieties of neurotic. Add the full-blown and/or borderline multiple-personalities, narcissists, obsessives, sado-masochists, paranoiacs, bipolars, schizophrenics and psychotics, etc. *What's left?*

Strange is it not that most of us haven't a clue what it means to be pathological? Most people can't tell the difference between a neurotic and a psychotic.

> **Alarming Statistics:** *"...there are more sociopaths among us than people who suffer from the much-publicized disorder of anorexia, four times as many sociopaths as schizophrenics, and one hundred times as many sociopaths as people diagnosed with a known scourge such as colon cancer"* - Martha Stout

## The Four Riders of the Pathocalypse

In my work on female psychology, I make mention of four other neurotic types: **Schizoids**, **Depressives**, **Compulsives** and **Hysterics** - the four riders of the pathocalypse.

A person can embody more than one of these pathologies, and every one of them is the Frankensteinean product of schizogenic domestic and social environments.

A hysteric can also be schizoid, while a depressive can embody compulsive traits. It's not uncommon to find depressives with hysterical traits, and many compulsives are also somewhat schizoid.

Alarmingly, these odd combinations are also found in relationships. A depressive may find themselves attracted to a compulsive or even a hysteric, and vice versa. The reasons for this become clear once we know what distinguishes each of the four types.

## The Schizoid Type

Basically, the schizoid type is characteristically wooden, cynical, apprehensive and withdrawn. They are armored and incapable of emoting. Showing their feelings is considered a sign of weakness. Consequently, the schizoid develops an impenetrable shield against others who cannot reach them. This attitude and behavior does not stop them functioning efficiently in society. Indeed, the schizoid type works well in offices and corporations. He doesn't let emotion get in the way of his "performance." He actually becomes prideful about his professionalism and doesn't like working with people who are relaxed, spontaneous, sloppy and expressive.

> **Modern Epidemic:** *"Many psychotherapists have pointed out that more and more patients exhibit schizoid features and the 'typical' kind of psychic problem in our day is not hysteria, as it was in Freud's time, but the schizoid type that is to say, the problem of persons who are detached, unrelated, lacking in affect, tending towards depersonalization, and covering up their problems by means of intellectualizations and technical formulations…There is also plenty of evidence that the sense of isolation, the alienation of one's self from the world is suffered not only by people in pathological conditions, but by countless 'normal' persons as well in our day"* - Rollo May

## The Compulsive Type

The compulsive type is similar in kind to the stiff schizoid. They may even get along quite well together. The compulsive is an obsessive type whose relations with external objects is controlling. He obsesses about the height of the grass in his garden. He obsesses about the wrinkles in the sheets, blankets and curtains, about the disorganized jars and cans in the cupboard and dining-table arrangement. He never drives over the speed-limit, and is always super-concerned with his appearance. Like the schizoid, he usually makes an exceptional employee. He prefers being in a superior position, and usually makes an obnoxious boss or headmaster. He's attracted to jobs allowing him to regiment others. We find him working for the police, army or state. Disorder unnerves this type enormously. Even though everything is clean, neat and precise in their lives, there's no love involved. Nothing owned is cherished for its own sake. If they have relationships of an intimate kind it is always with people who are submissive, dependent and weak.
