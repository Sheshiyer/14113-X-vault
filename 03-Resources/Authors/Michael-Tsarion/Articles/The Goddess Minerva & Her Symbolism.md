**Illuminati Degree System**  
The Illuminati divided their Order and system of initiation into three categories and nine stages. The three stages or grades were:  

|                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- |
| Nursery Grade  <br>Masonry Grade  <br>Mystery Grade |

The Nursery Grade was itself divided into three stages of:  

|                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ |
| Novice  <br>Minerval, and  <br>Illuminatus Minor |

The Masonic Grade was divided into:  

|                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ |
| Illuminatus Major, and  <br>Illuminatus Dirigens |

And within the Mystery Grade were four final stages of:  

|                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presbyter  <br>Principatus Illuminatus  <br>Magus, and  <br>Rex |

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Minerva was probably revered by the Illuminati because of her connection to Prometheus who, with the goddess's assistance, stole fire (knowledge) from the gods of Olympus so men on earth could rise above a primitive level and eventually match the gods in power and ability. |

Dividing schools of mystery according to a _threefold_ schemata was once the habit of the Irish Druids. This is significant since Minerva had undoubtedly been based on the ancient Irish goddess Brigid.  
  
We might note the suggestive fact that the final initiatory stage of the final grade was named "Rex," which means "King." The Illuminati were officially supposed to be anti-monarchy. This term leads us to doubt this assertion. After all, it was an assertion made by the Illuminati elite. Additionally, the esoteric symbolism pertaining to the cult of Minerva was employed during the coronation ceremony of Queen Elizabeth II. So, despite the spin, we might question whether there is truly a difference between the Illuminati and the royal houses of the world? We think not.  
  
Incidentally, thirteen objects of regalia were involved during the Queen's coronation. This is the same number of stars on the flag of the United States of Europe, and that can be found above the eagle's head on the US one dollar bill. As we showed in the _Irish Origins of Civilization_ (Volume Two), thirteen is the number of the Cult of Aton. In Judaism, thirteen denotes the Levites. The Levites were the recipients of the secret and mysterious "Oral Tradition" on Mount Sinai. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html) for more...)

As I point out in the _Irish Origins of Civilization_, the dove is the emblem of the "Davids," or commanders of the House of Aton. The dove staff is referred to as the "Virge," meaning Virgin. As well as referring to the astrological sign of Virgo, it is yet another occult reference to Minerva.  

**Who Was Minerva?**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_...daughter of Jupiter, patroness of health, learning, and wisdom_ - Bulfinch's Mythology (Glossary)|

The Roman goddess Minerva was based on the Greek Athena, who, in turn, was based on earlier Egyptian goddesses such as Isis and Neith. These goddesses were, in turn, based on earlier Western antetypes. They were described as "virginal" and were commonly depicted with fair complexions. They were the mothers of the various sun gods. Most of the Eastern goddesses who turn up in Greek and Roman pantheons were based on the Aryan goddesses Danu, Ana and Brigit. One perfect example is Hera, the supreme goddess of the Greeks. She was based on Eri, goddess of Ireland. (See Chapter Ten, _The Disciples of Horus_, for more on this subject.)  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Minerva was the Roman name of Greek goddess Athena. She was considered to be the virgin goddess of warriors, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, crafts, and the inventor of music_ - Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia (Entry on Minerva)  <br>  <br>_In Sais the statue of Athena whom they believe to be Isis, bore the mysterious inscription: "I am all that has been, and is, and shall be, and my robe no mortal has yet uncovered"_ - Plutarch|

From the name _Athena_ we get the city name Athens. Many cities of the world were consecrated to goddesses. The very word city may derive from _cteis_, meaning "circle" (a reference to the ovum). Athena was a version of Egyptian goddesses Neith and Isis. Neith was depicted as warlike and armored, same as the Grecian version (Pallas Athena). She carried a bow, which doubles up as a womb symbol. (Arrows being phallic symbols.)  
  
So we can see that the Illuminati worshiped pagan goddesses. More importantly, their Minerva was based on Egyptian antetypes. This helps us to link them to the Solar and Stellar Cults of antiquity. If the members of the Order are not biologically related to the sun priests of old, they are certainly _ideologically_ related.    

**Minerva's Birth**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Minerva (Pallas, Athene), the goddess of wisdom, was the offspring of Jupiter, without a mother. She sprang forth from his head completely armed. Her favorite bird was the owl, and the plant sacred to her the olive_ - Bulfinch's Mythology|

![Picture](https://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/7807145_orig.jpg)

In British mythology Minerva was known as Sulis. The bronze head above - of Minerva (or Sulis) - was discovered at the city of Bath that was dedicated to her. The word _Sulis_ means "eye." It also means "opening" or "portal." This latter meaning connotes the female vagina. Some scholars believe the word Sulis comes from the Indo-European _Sewel_, which meant "sun." Minerva was undoubtedly a version of Baratana, and the the primordial Irish goddess Brigid. Scholars accept that she is closely connected to the Celtic Brigantia. The Christian Saint Brigid of Kildare was also based on the early Irish goddess. (See sources section below for more on these goddesses.) In the movie _Avatar_, James Cameron's protagonist goes by the name Jake Sully. Is this a subtextual reference to Sulis and Minerva, goddess of the Illuminati?  

![Picture](https://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/2855098.jpg?402)

**Minerva the Virgin**  
Not only was Minerva "immaculately" conceived (being without a mother), but she was also a virginal goddess.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_If we examine the name of Athena, we shall, perhaps, be able to paint a picture soberer in colouring but nearer to the facts. The longer form of Athena's name, Athenaia, is simply a feminine adjective, she-of-Athens, the maiden of Athens. The Hymn addresses her as "Pallas, our Lady of Athens." This other name, Pallas, simply means virgin. If the claim of Hera to maidenhood is shadowy, it is not so with Athena. She is maiden through and through, and her temple is rightly called the maiden-sanctuary, the Parthenon_ - Jane Harrison (_Myths of Greece and Rome_)|

**Related Goddesses**  
The Roman Minerva was a composite deity. She is either identical with, or mythologically related to, the following goddesses of antiquity:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||Menrva (Etruscan)  <br>Pallas Athena (Greek)  <br>Neith (Egypt)  <br>Ma'at (Egypt)  <br>Isis (Egypt)  <br>Brigantia (Britain)  <br>Brigid (Ireland)  <br>Baratana (Britain)  <br>Victoria (Roman)  <br>Sulis (Britain)  <br>Saule (Balts)  <br>Nike (Roman)  <br>Vacuna (Roman)|

**Pallas Athena**  
The word _Pallas_ means "virginal." Minerva was, therefore, both immaculately conceived and virginal. For the Greeks Pallas Athena symbolized man's reason. She assisted Prometheus in his plot to steal "fire" (knowledge) from the gods to give to men. This is because she sprang from the head of Zeus. Hitherto, men have associated her with the intellect and with reason. In this aspect she is close to the Egyptian goddess Ma'at, and many other "virgin" goddess of Egypt, such as Neith and Isis. In fact, if we examine the names _Neith_ and _Athena_, we can see faint etymological similarities.

Minerva was known by the Athenians  
of Greece as Athena or Pallas Athena.

**The Shakespeare Controversy**  
A secondary meaning of _Pallas_ is "shaker." Indeed, Athena was known as the "Spear Shaker." Since her symbol was the spear, some scholars have been lead to connect Athena to the work of William _Shakespeare,_ whom, it is believed, adopted his surname from the goddess in question. Moreover, some researchers believe that the historical personage responsible for the plays and poems of "Shakespeare," was none other than scientific genius Sir Francis Bacon, the editor of the King James Bible and author of the _The New Atlantis._ Suggestively, Bacon was a member of a Masonic enclave known as the "Knights of the Helmet," named after Minerva, or Pallas Athena. These goddesses - along with Anat and Tanit, etc - may derive from a Persian original known as Anahita.

Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626 AD) is believed by  
some occult researchers to be the true author of the  
works of Elizabethan playwright William Shakespeare.

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_A Knight Templar, and major Occultist, Sir Francis Bacon was appointed Solicitor-General and Chief Advisor to the British Crown on June 25th 1607. He conceived the idea of reactivating various secret societies and in 1580 founded the secret Rosicrosse Literary Society and the Lodge of Free and Accepted Speculative Masons. Bacon is said to have introduced the 33 Degree system into Masonry, from the original Templar 9 Degrees_ - Tony Bushby (_Bible Fraud_)  <br>  <br>_For one year he had in his possession the first English translations of the Bible. In fact, he was the first major editor of what would become the King James Bible. He also added secret information into the Bible which was not there before. It will eventually be proved that the whole structure of the Authorized Bible was Francis Bacon’s. He was and ardent student not only of the Bible, but also of early manuscripts_ - William T. Smedley (_Biographer of Bacon_)|

of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the  
United States government. Note the inverted pentacle.  
  

**Minerva and the Owl**  
Minerva was the first deity to build an enclosed house. She is therefore connected with building and architecture. One of her symbols was the butterfly. However, her main symbol was the owl.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Her name has the "mn-" stem, linked with memory. See Greek "Mnemosyne"...memory, remembrance, recollection. The Romans could have confused her foreign name with their word mens meaning "mind" since one of her aspects as goddess pertained not only to war but also to the intellectual. Minerva is the Roman name for Athena the goddess of Wisdom and Virginity. She is also depicted as an owl_ - Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia (Entry on Minerva)|

|---|The owl of goddess Minerva secreted onto the US one dollar bill. Minerva was, like the Egyptian goddess Neith, connected with webs and weaving. The owl is the symbol of the Bohemian Club. It may also be a symbol for the Order of the Illuminati. In the Illuminati system of initiation, there is a degree named "Minerval." As far as the dollar symbolism goes, Minerva could quite easily and realistically associated with the number 1. After all, she was the firstborn of Jupiter, was immaculately conceived, virginal, and independent. Minerva was the goddess of war. Certainly, warmongering has enriched the United States government more than any other enterprise.|---|

**Minerva as War Goddess**  
In her warlike aspect, Minerva resembles the Egyptian goddess Neith, who was also considered "virginal."  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_She was also a warlike divinity; but it was defensive war only that she patronized, and she had no sympathy with Mars's savage love of violence and bloodshed. Athens was her chosen seat, her own city, awarded to her as the prize of a contest with Neptune, who also aspired to it_ - Bulfinch's Mythology  <br>  <br>_They were at last subdued by thunderbolts, which Minerva invented, and taught Vulcan and his Cyclopes to make for Jupiter_ - ibid|

**Chief Symbols of Minerva**

|---|---|
||House  <br>Spear  <br>Axe (Labrys)  <br>Olive Tree  <br>Owl  <br>Butterfly  <br>Sea Eagle  <br>Serpent  <br>Web  <br>Helmet  <br>Shield or emblem featuring Medusa's Head|

**Athens and the Serpent**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The serpent was mixed up to a considerable extent with the worship of many other of the Grecian deities. The statues, by Phidias, of Minerva, represent her as decorated with this emblem. In ancient medals, as shown by Montfaucon, she sometimes holds a caduceus in her right hand; at other times she has a staff around which a serpent is twisted, and at others, a large serpent appears going in front of her; while she is sometimes seen with her crest composed of a serpent. It is remarkable too, that in the Acropolis at Athens was kept a live serpent who was generally considered the guardian of the place, and Athens was a city specially consecrated to Minerva -_ (_Ophiolatreia_)  <br>  <br>_The goddess Minerva also was often represented with a dragon, or serpent - in statues, medals, and the like. The city of Athens was specially consecrated to her - and in the Acropolis there was kept a live serpent, which was regarded as the guardian of the place_ - Henry Shepheard (_Traditions of Eden_)|

**Minerva and the Creation of Man**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Prometheus was one of the Titans, a gigantic race, who inhabited the earth before the creation of man. To him and his brother Epimetheus was committed the office of making man, and providing him and all other animals with the faculties necessary for their preservation. Epimetheus undertook to do this, and Prometheus was to overlook his work, when it was done. Epimetheus accordingly proceeded to bestow upon the different animals the various gifts of courage, strength, swiftness, sagacity; wings to one, claws to another, a shelly covering to a third, etc. But when man came to be provided for, who was to be superior to all other animals, Epimetheus had been so prodigal of his resources that he had nothing left to bestow upon him. In his perplexity he resorted to his brother Prometheus, who, with the aid of Minerva, went up to heaven, and lighted his torch at the chariot of the sun, and brought down fire to man. With this gift man was more than a match for all other animals. It enabled him to make weapons wherewith to subdue them; tools with which to cultivate the earth; to warm his dwelling, so as to be comparatively independent of climate; and finally to introduce the arts and to coin money, the means of trade and commerce - (_Bulfinch's Mythology)|

**The Palladium of Troy**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_There was in Troy a celebrated statue of Minerva called the Palladium. It was said to have fallen from heaven, and the belief was that the city could not be taken so long as this statue remained within it_ _- (_Bulfinch's Mythology)|

**City of Bath**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Bladud built the city of Bath, and dedicated the medicinal waters to Minerva. He was a man of great invention, and practiced the arts of magic_ - (Bulfinch's Mythology)|

**Minerva as Weaver**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|---|_Minerva invented the flute, and played upon it to the delight of all the celestial auditors -_ ibid|

**The Queen of Spades**  
In regular playing decks Minerva is depicted as the Queen of Spades. The suit of Spades represents the warrior (knightly) class. The Hearts or Cups represent the clergy, the Clubs or Wands represent the peasant or worker class, and the diamonds or disks represent the merchant class. In the Tarot the Queen of Spades is equivalent with the Queen of Swords. In the Major Arcana, the card entitled _Justice_ is assigned to the astrological sign of Libra. The esoteric symbolism of this both Libran cards (Queen of Swords and Justice) features prominently during the coronation of the Queen of England, Elizabeth Windsor.

|---|The Queen of Spades (center card) depicts the goddess Minerva or Pallas Athena. The suit of spades corresponds with the Tarot's suit of Swords. Minerva would therefore be represented by the Tarot card known as the Queen of Swords. It is associated with the astrological sign of Libra, that is in turn connected to Ma'at, goddess of balance and harmony.|---|

|---|The Queen of Swords of the Tarot's Minor Arcana. This card is associated with the Egyptian goddess Ma'at. It is also connected to Libra, the seventh sign of the zodiac. Minerva was associated with the seventh month of the year. Interestingly, during the coronation ceremony of Elizabeth Windsor, the symbolism of this Tarot card was employed. In other words, esoteric symbolism pertaining to the goddesses Ma'at and Minerva was incorporated into the Queen's coronation ceremony. The Major Arcana card assigned to Libra is numbered eleven and entitled _Justice._ Indeed, Minerva was the goddess of Justice. Statues of Minerva holding the scales of justice can be seen on numerous buildings throughout the western world.  <br>  <br>     [H](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=irish+origins+of+civilization&emb=0)[ere](https://unslaved.com/the-queens-coronation/) - The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth|---|
