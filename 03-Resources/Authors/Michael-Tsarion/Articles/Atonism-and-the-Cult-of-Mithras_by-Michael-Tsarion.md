Atonism has adopted strange guises throughout the long ages since it was born in and subsequently expunged from Egypt. As revealed in my books and sites, Atonist elements are conspicuous in Judaism, Culdeanism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, as well as in Masonry and Templarism. I have also shown that Atonism was a corruption of Druidism and Amenism, the ancient _stellar_ theologies. It was also a corruption of ancient Persian traditions well known throughout the Levant.  
  
Both the Gaels of Ireland and Iranians of Persia were descended from the Scythians who were, in my opinion, nobles in Egypt and other lands. The Scythians were also known as the _Saca_, from which we derive the term Sage. They were the progenitors of the Saxons, Medes and other branches of the Arya, such as the Iranian Magi. They are to be considered the Druids of the Levant, three of whom allegedly appeared in the stable at Bethlehem bearing gifts for Jesus; the whole story of Jesus being based on much earlier myths pertaining to Mithras and Zoroaster. ([Here](https://infogalactic.com/info/Mithra) for more...)  

**.**  

**The Aryans**  
Iran (like Ireland) is a word alluding to those _Aryans_ occupying the Middle East. It was their lore and traditions that were unrighteously appropriated by later entities, namely Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, etc.  
  
The Cult of Mithra or Mithras (of which Zoroastrianism, Mazdakism, Manicheanism, Sufism and Sol Invictus were less pure variants) was prominent long before the periods of Roman imperial expansion and rise of Christianity. Although it had been a pure and noble philosophy for centuries, after the destruction of the Persian Empire by Alexander and rise of Christianity, it eventually became adulterated with spurious accretions. This was chiefly due to the need for secrecy and also due to the decadent priesthood which sought to offset the influence of Rome and Christianity.  
  
After the rise of orthodox Islam (sixth century AD) the Cult of Mithras was forced underground, and - like so many august traditions - eventually degenerated and morphed into the more popular school of Zoroastrianism. After this decline, during the reign of the Parthians, I believe it was further corrupted by Setian-Atonists. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-4.html) for more...)  
  
The symbolism employed by Masons and other secret societies - such as the infamous Bohemian Society and Order of the Skull and Bones - derives from Zoroastrianism, the degraded form of Aryan Mithraism. Similarly, what we know as Culdeanism and Christianity are degraded forms of both Irish Druidism and Persian Mithraism.

| _Although the term Druid is local, their religion was of deep root and a distant origin. It was of equal antiquity with those of the Persian Magi, the Chaldeans of Assyria, and the Brahmins of Hindustan.

**The Kabala**  
Of even greater importance is the fact that the Mithraic cult was in fact that of his _mother -_ the goddess Cybele. Indeed Mithras was _androgynous_ and frequently worshiped in female guise. In Persian the word _mitra_ pertains to females.  
  
From Cybele we get the terms _Cabala_ and _cabal_ (meaning secret society). Known throughout Europe, the Levant and Asia in numerous guises and names, she was probably the most important goddess figure of antiquity, particularly to those within secret enclaves. She may have been a transmogrified version of the Persian goddess Anahita, herself the origin of Anat, Tanit, Neith and Athene.

|---|The Kabalistic Tree of Life isn't Jewish. Its origins are Aryan (Iranian, Persian). The term Kabala or Cabala is a variation of the name of Cybele (originally known as Kubaba.) Interestingly, one of Cybele's other major emblems was the cube, the term probably derived from _her_ name. We find a giant black cube the city of Petra, and more famously in Mecca, worshiped by Muslims. The priests of Islam, guardians of the stone were originally known as "Guardians of the Old Woman." It is also now  recognized that Allah was transmogrified from the female deity Allat, a version of Aphrodite and Cybele. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Lat) for more...)|---|

The sigil of the Skull and Bones Order includes the lodge number 322. Esoterically, this refers to March 22, the first day of Aries and Spring Equinox, a central astrological zone and festival day for Mithraists.|---|

Terrorism & the Illuminati  

Another recommended work on this subject is _Terror and the Illuminati_, by David Livingstone. Although a Christian, and not a disciple of Mithraism, Livingstone provides many interesting details into the history of Iran and neighboring lands. Livingstone covers many of the most powerful cabals and dynasties of the Middle East, those I refer to as the Eastern Illuminati.  
  
Livingstone traces the all-important connections between these Atonist (or as he refers to them, "Judaic" or "Davidic" bloodlines) and modern royal dynasties. He deals with the elite houses of Orontid, Commagene, Herod, Sinclair, Angevin, Lorraine, Guise, Welf (Guelph), Brandenburg, Hapsburg, Merovingian, Carolingian, Stuart and Plantagenet, etc.  
  
Of great interest were the connections between the "Jewish" Herod family, Roman Caesars and Templar-Merovingians of France and Scotland.  
  
**The Cult of Mithras**  
It was in the dissemination of the original Mysteries of Mithras, that we find the first coalescence of those families which would ultimately produce the leading Illuminati bloodlines. This network was centered around the House of Herod, and included an important Armenian bloodline. The importance of this Armenian bloodline figures both in their supposed descent from the Lost Tribe, and their mixed Alexandrian and Persian heritage, a hereditary Syrian priesthood of Baal, and the family of Julius Caesar. It was the coalescence of these families, at the turn of the first Millennium BC, that effectively incepted the conspiracy. And, while the trail of these familial relationships is complicated and detailed, it is essential to examine them, in order to properly understand the origin, direction and beliefs of their successors, the Illuminati.  
  
Essentially, these families were responsible for the formation and spread of the Mithraism, the most popular cult of the Roman Empire. It was this cult that remained the core doctrine of the Illuminati for centuries to come. Initially, the formation of Mithraism served a conspiracy to supplant the Christian Church. It was ultimately successful, when one of their descendants, Constantine the Great, implemented Catholicism, which was but an assimilation of Mithraism, associating Jesus with the cult of the dying-god. The cult eventually penetrated to the Islamic world to produce the heresy of the Ismailis, from which emerged the first terrorist network, the Assassins. It was the legend of contact with the Assassins with the notorious Knights Templars, during the Crusades, which became the basis of Scottish Rite Freemasonry.  
  
Initially, the cult of the heretical Magi was most prevalent in that part of Asia Minor, that is, of Armenia, Cappadocia and Pontus. Pontus was founded following the death of Alexander the Great, shortly after 302 BC. As the greater part of this kingdom lay within the immense region of Cappadocia, which in early ages extended from the borders of Cilicia to the Black Sea, the kingdom as a whole was at first called “Cappadocia towards the Pontus”, but afterwards simply “Pontus”. Pontus included not only Pontic Cappadocia, but also Colchis, and Lesser Armenia. Therefore, this cult of the Magi, which worshipped the dying-god in the form of Mithras, was most prevalent in that part of Asia Minor to which the so-called Lost Tribes had been relocated, to be later absorbed by Scythians and Medes.  
  
**Commangene (Cappadocia)**  
Commagene was a small kingdom, located in modern south-central Turkey, in what had once been part of greater Cappadocia, with its capital city as Samosata, or modern Samsat, near the Euphrates. Commagene was ruled by a dynasty known as the Orontids. The dynasty was founded by Orontes, who had been appointed by the Persians as “satrap”, or governor of Armenia. In 401 BC, Artaxerxes II, then reigning Emperor of Persia, gave him his daughter Rhodogoune in marriage. Artaxerxes II would have been the grandson of Xerxes, who according to Jewish tradition, married Esther, of the Book of Esther…The Armenian kingdom of Commagene arose in 162 BC, when its governor Ptolemy broke free from the disintegrating Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy’s son Mithradates I Callinicus of Commagene embraced the Hellenistic culture and married Laodice, a Seleucid princess. Thus, their son, Antiochus I of Commagene, who lived from 69 BC to 40 BC, could claim dynastical ties with both Alexander the Great and the Persian kings. The combined heritage found in Antiochus led to the assimilation of Mithras with the Greek Hercules, which marked the first early form of the Mithraic cult.  
  
**The Mithraic Bloodline**  
The House of Commagene combined with the family of Herod the Great, the Syrian priest-kings of Baal, and the family of Julius Caesar. Together, they took the early symbolism of the Mithra worship of the heretical Magi, and combined it with the emerging Kabbalistic mysticism, to form the Mysteries of Mithras. Essentially, the Mithraic mysteries adapted the ancient king-worship of the Babylonians, to the worship of the emperor, as a personification of their god the Sun. Through the influence of the Commagenian dynasty, this cult retained its Persian themes, but represented its god Mithras with the physical form of their progenitor, Alexander the Great… The person through which the House of Commagene was able to enter into contact with that of Herod, in addition to the family of Julius Caesar, to produce the Mithraic bloodline, which went on to produce the leading conspiratorial families of Europe, was Antiochus IV. Antiochus IV’s great grandfather, Antiochus I of Commagene had supported Pompey against the Parthians, and in 64 BC was rewarded with additional territories. After submitting to Greek rule under the Seleucids, the Persian Empire eventually re-emerged under the Parthians, a semi-nomadic people who, in the second century BC, arose from an area southeast of the Caspian Sea. It was ruled by the Arsacids, who claimed descent from the Persian king Artaxerxes II. Through the conquests of Mithradates I and Artabanus II in the second century BC, the Parthians established control over Iran and expanded westward into Mesopotamia.  
  
**Caesar Augustus**  
Antiochus I was able to deflect Roman attacks from Mark Antony, whom he eventually joined in the Roman civil war, but after Antony’s defeat to Augustus, Commagene was made a Roman client state. This state of affairs signaled the beginning of the relationships that led to the transference of the Mithraic cult to Rome. Augustus, who ruled the Roman Empire from 27 BC to 68 AD, was the first of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, followed by Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, until the last of the line, Nero, who committed suicide. The dynasty is so named because its members were drawn from the Julia and the Claudius family. Julia derive their name from Iulus, or Julus, also known as Ascanius, who, according to Greek and Roman mythology, was a son of Aeneas, himself the son of Aphrodite, the Greek Venus, and the cousin of Priam. The name “Ascanius” is thought to have been derived from Ashkenazi, or Ashkuza, the name given to the Scytians by the ancient Akkadians. After the Trojan War, Ascanius escaped to Latium in Italy and had a role in the founding of Rome as the first king of Alba Longa. The founder of the dynasty, Caesar Augustus, was a Julian through his adoption by his great-uncle, Julius Caesar.  
  
**Emperor Caligula**  
In 17 AD, Tiberius deposed Antiochus I’ successor, Antiochus III, but Caligula reinstated his son Antiochus IV of Commagene, and even enlarged his territory. And, although Caligula deposed him shortly after, he was again restored by Claudius in in 41 AD. In 52 AD, Antiochus VI campaigned against some wild tribes there which had been harrowing the coastal cities. And Beck considers that, “it is worth considering whether the germination of the Mysteries might not have taken place when Commagenean and Cilician Mithra-worship coalesced at the exposure of Commagenean administrators and military to the rites of the Cilician tribes.” Antiochus IV’s associate, Caligula, was influenced by the Babylonian or Mithraic tradition of worshipping the king as embodiment of the sun-god, and cult which he tried to institute in the Roman Empire. In addition, reflecting the characteristics of his occult leanings, Caligula was described, by H. H. Scullard, a former professor of ancient history at King’s College, as a “monster of lust and diabolical cruelty.”  
  
**Caligula and Herod**  
Caligula, like Antiochus IV, was also a close friend of Herod Agrippa, king of Judea, also called the Great, who lived from 10 BC to 44 AD. Herod Agrippa was the king named “Herod” in the Acts of the Apostles, in the Bible. He was the grandson of Herod the Great, rebuilder of the Temple. Herod the Great arose from a wealthy, influential Idumaean family. The Idumaeans were successors to the Edomites, who had settled in Edom in southern Judea, but between 130-140 BC, were required to convert to Judaism. According to Josephus, after the murder of his father, young Agrippa was sent by Herod the Great to the imperial court in Rome. There, Tiberius conceived a great affection for him, and he eventually became a close friend of Caligula. And on the assassination of Caligula in 41AD, Agrippa’s advice helped to secure the ascension as emperor Claudius, who was also the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia, and who eventually made Herod Agrippa governor of Judea.  
  
**The Emesa Dynasty**  
Along with Commagene and the Julio-Claudian families, a third would be introduced into this mix, which would feature in not only the creation of Mithraism, but its continued preservation through the centuries, culminating in the Illuminati families of Europe. That family was the hereditary priest-kings of Emesa. The Royal Family of Emesa, today Hims in Syria, was a dynasty of Priest-Kings who formed a powerful and influential aristocracy. Emesa was renowned for the Temple of the Sun, known as Elagabalus, a derivation of Baal, adored in a shape of a black stone. Around 64 BC, Pompey the Great had reorganized Syria and the surrounding countries into Roman Provinces, and had installed client kings, who would be allies to Rome. One of those client kings, would be Sampsiceramus, the founding member of the Priest-King dynasty of Emesa.  
  
**St.** **Paul and Mithraism**  
Paul seems to have been part of a conspiracy on the part of the House of Herod, to subvert the emerging Christian movement, by conforming it to their occult doctrines. Paul was from Tarsus, the capitol city of Cilicia, the very hub of the intrigues that produced the Mithraic religion. In addition, according to Robert Eisenmen, in Paul as a Herodian, there is evidence, in the New Testament, early Church literature, Rabbinic literature, and Josephus, to suggest some connection between Paul and so-called “Herodians.”  
  
**France and the Merovingians**  
The myth of the union of Jesus and Mary Magdalene was preserved to disguise a more occult secret about the origin of this bloodline. More importantly, the descendants of the Merovingians eventually intermarried with the family of Charlemagne, founder of the Holy Roman Empire, and supposedly, that of an Exilarch, or claimant to the Davidic throne, named Rabbi Makhir. It is from this lineage that all the leading lines of European aristocracy descend, a bloodline featured as the central secret of Grail lore. The Merovingians, again, came originally from Scythia, where they were known as the Sicambrians, taking their name from Cambra, a tribal queen of about 380 BC. Then, in the early fifth century AD, the invasion of the Huns provoked large-scale migrations of almost all European tribes. It was at this time that the Sicambrians, a tribe of the Germanic people collectively known as the Franks, crossed the Rhine and moved into Gaul, establishing themselves in what is now Belgium and northern France. The Merovingians are believed in occult circles to have originally been Jewish, and descended from the Tribe of Benjamin, who had entered Greece known as Cadmus and Danaaus. Certain important details of the history of the Merovingians are related in the Fredegar’ Chronicle, a facsimile of which is in the Biblioteque Nationale in Paris. Fredegar, who died in 660 AD, was a Burgundian scribe, and his Chronicle covered the period from the earliest days of the Hebrew patriarchs to the era of the Merovingian kings. Fredegar’s Prologue tells how the Sicambrian line of “Franks”, from whom France acquired its name, were themselves first so called after their chief Francio, a descendant of Noah, who died in 11 BC. Prior to their Scythian days, Francio’s race originated in ancient Troy after which the French city of Troyes was named. The city of Paris, established by the sixth century Merovingians, likewise bears the name of Paris, the son of King Priam of Troy, whose liaison with Helen of Sparta sparked the Trojan War.  
  
**Rulers Over All**  
According to the genealogies compiled by James Allen Dow, and based largely on the work of David Hughes, a descendant of Mary Magdalene and this Jesus, Quintus Tarus, a prefect of Rome, married Argotta, heiress of the Franks, to father Merovech, King of the Franks. The most famous of all Merovingian rulers, though, was Merovee’s grandson, Clovis I, who reigned between 481 and 511 AD. Gaul was the richest and largest area of the western empire, but the Frankish tribes had not succeeded in organizing a single state, until Clovis defeated the surviving Roman forces in 486 AD. During his reign and that of his sons, Frankish power was extended over nearly all of Gaul and far into Germany. The Frankish kingdom eventually became the strongest and most extensive of the new German states, and it was the only one that truly survived into later centuries, and from it were descended the modern states of both Germany and France.

||_The descendants of Clovis are called Merovingians. They occupied the throne of the Franks for nearly two hundred and fifty years. The annals of their reigns form an unpleasant catalogue of bloody wars, horrible murders, and deeds of treachery without number. Nevertheless, the earlier Merovingians were strong men, under whose direction the Frankish territory continued to expand, until it included nearly all of what is now France, Belgium, and Holland, besides a considerable part of Germany_ - Hutton Webster (_Early European History_)|

**Charlemagne (the Merovingian)**  
It is frequently claimed by genealogists that all of European aristocracy can claim descent from Charlemagne. Less well-known, though significant for occult lore, is that Charlemagne’s descendants were intricately intertwined with those of one Rabbi Makhir, a Jewish Exilarch from Baghdad, known as Rabbi Makhir, or Natronai, who became the father of Guillaume the Gellone. This was the important union, infusing European aristocracy with Davidic lineage, by which occult societies, and books like the _Holy Blood, Holy Grail_, have claimed represented the secret of the Holy Grail. Coincidentally, according to Medieval Jewish legends, one Makhir, often confused with Natronai, apparently arrived in southern France by the invitation of Charlemagne, who is said to have sent an embassy, in which a Jew, Isaac, took part, to ask the “king of Babel” to send him a man of royal Jewish lineage. In response, the Caliph Harun al Rashid, dispatched Rabbi Makhir to him…that Makhir was “close to the king and all his descendants”, as meaning he was inter-related with French aristocracy, through intermarriage, was proposed by Arthur Zuckerman, in _A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France._ There are numerous confusing genealogies provided as to the descent of this Makhir, or Natronai. According to the research of James Allen Dow, Natronai married one Rolinda of Aquitaine. Their sons were Makhir and Gilbert of Rouergue. Makhir married Alda, the daughter of Charles Martel…According to Zuckerman, Makhir would have assumed the Christian name of Theodoric, or Thierry, and assumed the title of King of the Jews, and ruled over the independent state of Septimania in southern France, with the city of Narbonne as its capital. In the Mediaeval, romances Theirry is called Aymery, and he was the father of Guillaume de Gellone, about whom there were at least six major epic poems composed before the era of the crusades. The device of his shield was the Lion of Judah. At the height of his power, he included as part of his dominion, northeastern Spain, the Pyrenees, along with the region of Septimania. Zuckerman maintains the reference of Makhir’s descendants being “close” to those of the king should be understood to mean “inter-related”, or that Guillaume’s ancestors intermarried with those of the Carolingians.  
  
**The Sinclairs**  
The Sinclairs, like all Norman nobility, were also descended from the Viking, Rollo Ragnvaldsson and Poppa of Bavaria. Charles the Simple, King of France, met Rollo at the castle of St. Clair, and there made him Duke of Normandy. The Sinclairs soon multiplied to such an extent that they could not all stay at the castle of St. Clair, and were given various other castles around France. However, they all went to England with the Conqueror. One Sinclair, named William, did not like the Conqueror, his cousin, so with some other discontented barons he went to Scotland. William St. Clair, like William the Conqueror, and Alain IV of Brittany, were descended from Conan I of Brittany. The two Williams were the grandsons of Emma of Normandy’s brother, Richard II “the Good” of Normandy, and Judith of Brittany, the daughter of Conan I of Brittany and Ermangard of Anjou.  
  
**The** **Templars of Scotland**  
Robert the Bruce claimed the Scottish throne as a great-great-greatgreat grandson of David. He was also a descendant of Robert the Brus II, who married William St. Clair’s sister Agnes. Robert the Bruce was also the grandson of Walter Stewart, 3rd High Stewart of Scotland. Walter Stewart, the sixth High Steward of Scotland, played an important part in the Battle of Bannockburn. Walter Stewart then married Majory, daughter of Robert the Bruce, and their son Robert II, eventually inherited the Scottish throne after his uncle David II of Scotland died. From them were descended all subsequent Stewart, or Stuart, kings of Scotland.  
  
**Rosslyn Chapel**  
There are hundreds of stone carvings in the walls and in the ceiling of the Rosslyn Chapel, which represent biblical scenes, Masonic symbols, and examples of Templar iconography. There are swords, compasses, trowels, squares and mauls with images of the Solomon’s Temple. In addition to the Jewish and occult symbolism, there are also some traces of Islam and pagan serpents, dragons, and woodland trees. The fertility figure of the Green Man, a European version of the dying-god Dionysus, is to be found everywhere on the pillars and arches, together with fruits, herbs, leaves, spices, flowers, vines and the plants of the garden paradise…The remains of William St Clair, great-grandfather of the founder of Rosslyn Chapel, are said to be buried in Rosslyn, in the style of the Templars, in a grave marked by a skull and crossbones.  
  
**Escape of the Templars**  
Again, in England, the property of the Templars was also transferred to the Knights Hospitallers, by King Edward II, the son-in-law of Phillip IV of France. Edward II was married to Phillip IV’s daughter, Isabella of France. But Edward II initially refused to implement the papal order enforced by his father-in-law. Between October 13, 1307 and January 8, 1308, the Templars went unmolested in England. During this period many fugitive Templars, seeking to escape torture and execution, fled to apparent safety there. Although, after the intercession of Pope Clement V, King Edward II ordered the seizure of members of the order in England on January 8, 1308. Only handfuls of Templars were duly arrested however. But most Templars in England, as well as elsewhere outside France, altogether escaped arrest, let alone torture and execution.  
  
**The Order of the Garter**  
…the traditions of the Templars seems to have taken on a new guise, under the Order of the Garter, founded by Edward II’s son, Edward III King of England. Edward III’s sister, Joanna, married David II King of Scotland, the son of Robert the Bruce. While, in exile in the French court, it was David who created the The Guarde De Ecosse, derived from the Templar faction known as Scots Guard who came to the aid of Robert the Bruce. As the Scots Guard continued through the years, two of the prominent families involved in its history were the Sinclairs and the Stuarts. In France, they become the Personal Bodyguard to the French Kings…  
  
**Sinclairs and Rothschilds**  
Jacob Rothschild, the current head of the Rothschild dynasty, has intermarried with the Sinclair family, forging an important dynastic alliance between the head family of the Illuminati, and the supposed “Grail family”. This marriage is significant, as it is an exception in the marriage practices of the Rothschilds. The founder of the dynasty, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, had ordered his sons to marry only their first cousins. The first exception was Hannah, daughter of Nathan Rothschild, who married the Rt. Hon. Henry Fitzroy, a direct descendant of Charles II Stuart King of England. However, more recently, the great-great-great grandson of Nathan Mayer, Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild, Fourth Baron Rothschild, current head of the dynasty, married Mary Serena Dunn, whose mother was Lady Mary Sybil St. Clair-Erksine, the daughter of James Francis Harry St. Clair-Erskine, 5th Earl of Rosslyn. The title of Earl of Rosslyn was created in 1801 for Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Baron Loughborough, the former Lord Chancellor. The earldom was created with special remainder to his nephew, Sir James St Clair-Erskine, who was Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, on behalf of King George IV. The Erskine family were the hereditary Earls of Mar. They are descended from Robert I Erksine, who married Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of Robert II of Scotland, the son of Robert the Bruce’s daughter Marjorie and Robert Stewart. John 5th of Erskine was guardian of King James V, and afterwards of Mary, Queen of Scots. James V had an illegitimate child through his daughter, Margaret, named James Stewart, step-brother to Mary Queen of Scots. In 1565, Queen Mary made Margaret’s brother, John 7th Earl of Mar.  
  
Jacob Rothschild is the current head of the UK Rothschild family, having inherited the fourth baronetcy from his father, Victor, an eminent zoologist, and sometime MI5 agent and friend of KGB agents Anthony Blunt and Guy Burgess. Jacob resigned from the family’s bank NM Rothschilds in 1980, run by his cousin Evelyn, and started RIT Capital Partners. Jacob is chairman of Yad Hanadiv, the Rothschild foundation, which chairs the Jewish Policy Research, dedicated to promoting issues affecting Jews worldwide. Yad Hanadiv was also responsible for building and granting the Knesset government buildings, and the Supreme Court of Israel, which prominently features Masonic symbolism and the pyramid and all-seeing eye of the Illuminati. Jacob was a close personal friend of Princess Diana, and maintains strong personal and business links with Henry Kissinger. His country estate has been a regular venue for visiting heads of state including Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Margaret Thatcher received French President François Mitterrand there at a summit in 1990. He hosted the European Economic Round Table conference in 2002, attended by such figures as James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, Nicky Oppenheimer, Warren Buffet and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He knows Rupert Murdoch well, having been friends since the Australian newspaper magnate first came to the UK in the 60s.
