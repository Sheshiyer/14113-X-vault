|---|_Knowledge constitutes the original condition of the Absolute_ - Mircea Eliade|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|**John the Baptist**  <br>In the fifteenth year of the principality of Tiberius (hence in 28–29 AD, an ascetic, John the Baptist, began traveling about the Jordan district “proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins” (Luke 3:1). The historian Flavius Josephus describes him as an “honest man” who exhorted the Jews to practice virtue, justice, and piety. In fact, he was a true prophet, illuminated, irascible, and vehement, in open rebellion.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: In fact, as Eliade says, he was an ascetic. That Christianity's first major prophet was a ascetic is very important, showing that for all the doctoring, the religion is firmly based not only in pagan traditions, but in Gnosticism. Paul's Epistles, the first Christian texts, say barely anything about Christ's actual life. They are _not_ biographies, and are very poor in that respect. They emphasize Jesus' _mission_ of saving lost souls and showing men a way out of the dark fallen creation. Christians trying to gloss over the Gnostic elements in the New Testament have their work cut out for them. Move the goalposts all you want, it doesn't change the basic truth. Christianity is yet another _cult of mortification_, like hundreds of others throughout the world - Mtsar  <br>    <br><br>  <br>**Paul**  <br>...“a doctor of the law and respected by the whole people” (Acts 5:34).  <br>  <br>Despite the fifteen chapters (out of twenty-eight) that Acts devotes to him, despite the fourteen Epistles that are attributed to him, our knowledge of the life, apostolate, and thought of Saint Paul remains fragmentary.  <br>  <br>It is Saint Paul’s inestimable contribution that he rightly grasped the elements of the problem and had the courage to fight untiringly for the only solution that he considered just and consistent.  <br>  <br>**Epistles**  <br>...the Epistles represent the earliest and most important document of the primitive Church, for they reflect not only the most serious crises of nascent Christianity but also the creative daring of the first Christian theologian.  <br>  <br>Paul’s conversion can be put at the earliest in 32 and at the latest in 36. As we shall see, faith in the resurrected Christ constitutes the fundamental element of Christianity, especially of the Christianity of Saint Paul. This fact is of great importance, for his Epistles constitute the earliest documents that narrate the history of the Christian community.  <br>  <br>**Gospels**  <br>The Synoptic Gospels, composed between 70 and 90, collect the traditions transmitted orally transmitted by the earliest Christian communities. But these traditions concern Jesus as well as the resurrected Christ. This does not necessarily lessen their documentary value, for the essential element of Christianity - as is also the case with any religion laying claim to a founder - is precisely memory.  <br>  <br>**Acts of the Apostles**  <br>The Acts of the Apostles afford us a glimpse of the life of the first Christian community in Jerusalem.  <br>  <br>**Jesus Baptized**  <br>Immediately after his baptism Jesus withdrew into the wilderness. The Gospels state that “the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness” in order for him to be tempted there by Satan.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This raises questions immediately and is quite puzzling, since Jews did not normally practice baptism. It was a pagan rite, although eventually scholars realized that Jesus was perhaps a member of a obscure ascetic Jewish order such as the Essenes. Perhaps he was even a member of a Gnostic or quasi-Gnostic sect that practiced water oblations. Moreover, why endure temptation by Satan. That's for mortals to endure, not the one and only Son of God. The forty day sojourn in the wilderness is, in any case, a motif found throughout the world. Moses, the Jews and John the Baptist had their wilderness trials, as did Jesus. It's a motif that can be traced back to the primordial Stellar Cult, and has to do with the passage of the sun through the zodiac.<br><br>  <br>Death and resurrection by immersion in water constitute a well-known mythico-ritual scenario that is bound up with a universally documented aquatic symbolism.  <br>  <br>**Gnosticism in Paul**  <br>...Saint Paul himself regarded this world as dominated by Satan, and the Jewish and Christian apocalypses predicted the imminent destruction of the earth.  <br>  <br>Not only did he often use the Hellenistic religious vocabulary (_gnosis, mysterion, sophia, kyrios, soter_), but he adopted certain conceptions that were foreign to Judaism and to primitive Christianity. Thus, for example, Saint Paul took over the dualistic idea, fundamental to Gnosticism, of a “psychic man” inferior and opposed to the “spiritual man.”  <br>  <br>The Christian seeks to cast off the carnal man in order to become purely spiritual (_pneumatikos_). Another dualistic characteristic opposes God to the world, dominated by its “masters” (1 Cor 2:8), in other words, by the “elemental principles” principles” (Gal 4:3-9).  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Despite numerous Gnostic references throughout the Epistles and Gospels, Christian Literalists carry on blithely defining Paul's writings as "Christian," in complete avoidance of the facts. They demonstrate their utter hypocrisy time and again. Even with considerable editing and doctoring, Gnostic elements remain, and we can only wonder how many _more_ existed before mythmakers finished compiling their version of the New Testament.<br><br>  <br>**Gnostic Esotericism**  <br>It must be added that almost all the mythological and eschatological themes employed by the Gnostic authors are earlier than Gnosticism _stricto sensu_.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So finally Eliade concedes that the tenets and principles of Gnosticism, far predate the era of the first Gnostic schools appearing in cities such as Alexandria. Crucially, he accepts  the _oriental_ origin of Gnostic teachings. This is vital, since he helps us identify the corrupt unheroic, fatalistic sources which heavily influenced the ascetic religions of Judaism and Christianity, bringing ruin to the West:<br><br>  <br>A number of images and metaphors used by the Gnostic authors have a venerable history - even a prehistory - and an immense dissemination.  <br>  <br>Some of them are documented in ancient Iran and in India of the Upanishadic period, in Orphism and Platonism; others are characteristic of Hellenistic syncretism, biblical and intertestamentary Judaism, or the earliest expressions of Christianity.  <br>  <br>Unlike the Upanishads, Samkhya-Yoga and Buddhism - which deliberately avoid discussing the original cause of the fall of humanity - the redeeming knowledge taught by the Gnostics consists above all in the revelation of a “secret history” (more precisely, a history kept secret from the uninitiated) of the origin and creation of the world, the origin of evil, the drama of the divine redeemer come down to earth to save men, and the final victory of the transcendent God - a victory that will find expression in the conclusion of history and the annihilation of the cosmos.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: These false teachings infected many Western schools, and possessed many minds throughout the world. Platonism, for example, contains many Gnostic precepts. One German scholar believed that the age of Rationalism and even Materialism, with their focus on science, hard fact and objectivity, arose as a necessary response from the European mind to the influx of baleful eastern influences. It's an intriguing possibility, and novel to think of the Enlightenment and Modern Eras as essentially _anarchistic_.<br><br>  <br>...the “fall” of man, that is, the incarnation of the soul, was already a prime object of speculation for the Orphic and Pythagorean theologians; it was explained either as the punishment for a sin committed in heaven or as the result of a disastrous choice made by the soul itself. During the earliest centuries of the Christian era, these two myths were amplified and modified by numerous Gnostic and other authors.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: And as we know, Christianity holds that man is indeed nothing more than an unworthy "sinner" in the eyes of God. Not one in many millions of Christians questions the origin of this idiotic notion, or wonder where their religious precepts came from. They simply obey the priests, never asking where priesthoods themselves came from.<br><br>  <br>Since the world is the result of an accident or a catastrophe, since it is dominated by ignorance and ruled by the powers of evil, the Gnostic finds himself completely alienated from his own culture and rejects all of its norms and institutions.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Hence the pessimism and fatalism completely rejected by Virgil, Emperor Augustus and other dignitaries in Rome. Despite their vigilance and positivism, they were not able to stem the tide of subversive influences entering their world under the guise of Christianity.|---|

|---|The Roman poet Virgil (70–19 BC) and Emperor Augustus (63 BC-14 AD), tried to halt the incursion of subversive oriental and gnostic schools, whose fatalistic, pessimistic, dispassionate, libertine teachings and outlooks were not conducive to heroic Western sensibilities. Their otherworldly apocalyptic visions didn't accord with the Apollonian tendencies of Western races. Despite the valiant efforts of Virgil and Augustus, anti-heroic, anti-Western precepts entered under the guise of Judaism and Christianity, and the West has been encumbered and plagued ever since. Later Christian apologists worked to downplay the subversive "oriental" elements within their religion.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|**Jewish Influences**  <br>...a large number of the mythological images, figures and themes that are employed by Christian authors, and that will become the favorite subjects of European popular books and religious texts...  <br>  <br>**...From the beginning, it seems that there were well-organized secret groups which disclosed their esoteric doctrines and their unique methods to the initiated.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Yes, and there can be no doubt that it was Egyptian and Atonist.<br><br>  <br>**Jewish Gnosticism**  <br>...the Gnostic elements, to at least some degree detectable everywhere, derive in the last analysis from the older Jewish Gnosticism.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: In other work I speak about the devastation caused by the "Gnostic Cult" which long ago entered the West. It is an ancient body, sponsored by the Setian-Atonists and Gaonim, or Princes of Light, and many are its initiates and agents.<br><br>  <br>**Simon Magus**  <br>...was worshiped as the “first God,” and his companion, Helen, discovered by Simon in a brothel at Tyre, was regarded as the last and most fallen incarnation of the Thought (_Ennoia_) of God; redeemed by Simon, Helen-Ennoia became the means of universal redemption. Simon Magus is of interest to the historian of religions especially for the glorification of Helen and the mythology  <br>  <br><br>- Note: We see here another vital aspect of oriental thought, the _feminine_ principle or incarnation of god. It too eventually crept back into Christianity in the form of the Virgin Mary and cult of Mary Magdalene. It's a purely pagan, oriental and gnostic conception, especially important in many schools of Gnosticism. In some schools, the female Sophia is even considered the architect of the lower reality, with her child Satan-Jehovah presiding over the world. In other schools it is a female archimandrite - entitled "Helena" or "Helen" who stands as a central icon worshiped by the acolytes. In esoteric Judaism we find characters Lilith and Eve, representing the occult principle known as the Shekinah. Again, the secreted rites of the Judaic and Papal priesthoods isn't necessarily identical with that known to lower-level believers. The reason silly Gnostic ideas didn't die out in the early centuries is because self-important Jewish and Christian priests were attracted to the idea that only a chosen elect could possibly qualify to receive God's true message and favor. Clearly, despite superficial differences, figures such as Valentinus, Basilides, Paul, Marcion, Mani, and Simon Magus subscribed to this attractive edict. Each man saw himself as a Pneumatic - a specially gifted and selected adept to be worshiped by the world. The popes, cardinals and bishops of the Roman church, and many other despots besides, are possessed by the same idea.<br><br>  <br>...awakened by gnosis, the Pneumatics, and they alone, ascend to the Father.  <br>  <br>**Gnostic Principles**  <br>In the last analysis, the majority of these images - ignorance, amnesia, captivity, sleep, intoxication - become, in Gnostic preaching, metaphors to indicate spiritual death. Gnosis bestows true life, that is, redemption and immortality.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: And its all there in Christianity.<br><br>  <br>**Carpenter and Healer**  <br>Like so many other “divine men” of the Hellenistic world, Jesus was a physician and thaumaturge, curing all kinds of sicknesses and relieving the possessed.  <br>  <br>**Against the Jewish Priesthood**  <br>Jesus’ preaching soon began to disquiet the two politically and religiously influential groups, the Pharisees and Sadducees.  <br>  <br>The former were irritated by the liberties the Nazarene took in regard to the Torah. As for the Sadducees, they sought to avoid the disturbances that were likely to break out after any messianic propaganda. In fact, the Kingdom of God that Jesus preached suggested to some the religious fanaticism and political intransigence of the Zealots.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Remember that according to the scriptures, it was the priests of the Sanhedrin who demanded Jesus' arrest, not the Romans. In any case, the history of Judaism and Christianity is one of endless infighting and conflict. It wasn't the priests who were fighting with each other it was the people. It is only when fanatical groups within Judaism, such as the Sicarii and Zealots, began attacking Romans that punitive measures were enforced against Judea. Had the fanatics not precipitated chaos and ruin, Judea would have stood strong to this day. There would have been no displacement of Jews throughout the world, no second class status in the lands of hostile hosts, no marked antisemitism or need to act disingenuously and subversively in the lands of antagonistic nations. So much for their god, irrational beliefs and self-destructive actions.<br><br>  <br>**Two Thieves?**  <br>Jesus was crucified between two “thieves.” Josephus often used this term - _lēistai_ - to signify "revolutionists." “The context of Jesus’ execution was thus clearly the suppression of Jewish revolt against the rule of Romans and their collaborators in Judea.  <br>  <br>...it must be borne in mind that the earliest Christians, Jews of Jerusalem, constituted an apocalyptic sect within Palestinian Judaism. They were in daily expectation of the _Second Coming of Christ_, the _parousia_; it was the end of history that preoccupied...  <br>  <br>**...it was the end of history that preoccupied them, not the historiography of the eschatological expectation.**  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This eschatological notion was not originally Christian, and more importantly the Christians got it _wrong_. There goes any credibility of the religion. The Kingdom of God was shown to definitely _not_ be at hand. Jesus was a false prophet who wouldn't have been given the time of day if the priests hadn't so adamantly demanded that the Romans deal with him.<br><br>  <br>**Peter the False**  <br>The arrest, trial, and sacrifice of Jesus scattered the faithful. Soon after the arrest, Peter, Jesus’ favorite disciple, denied him three times.  <br>  <br>**Holy Spirit?**  <br>epiphanies of the Holy Spirit are a rather well-known theme in the history of religions: they are found in Mesopotamia, in Iran, in India. But the context of the Pentecost has a more definite aim: the violent wind, the tongues of fire, and the glossolalia are reminiscent of certain traditions concerning the theophany on Sinai.|---|

|---|John the Baptist, a figure clearly presented as an ascetic. As Christianity's first prophet, we see that the religion is characteristically and undeniably ascetic, that is - world and body denying. Let us not forget that without the presence of ascetic monks and the monastic tradition, Christianity would long ago have ceased being an important and pervasive institution. Stellar elements are revealed by the artists of biblical characters, as in this case, the figure looks _up_ toward the heavens, frequents the "wilderness" (a code word for the night sky and zodiac), and "prophesizes." The image may signify the constellation of Aquarius, which rose in the night sky during the summer period when the Nile rose to its height. Hence the motif of the "baptizer."|---|

|---|**Fanatical Jews Crushed**  <br>During the war, at the beginning of the summer of 68, a contingent of Vespasian’s army attacked and destroyed the “monastery” of Qumran, situated in the open desert on the shore of the Dead Sea. In all likelihood the defenders were massacred; but on the eve of the disaster they had time to hide a considerable number of manuscripts in large clay vessels.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The trouble is that when the cache was discovered in 1947, the texts did _not_ confirm the existence of Jesus as presented in the NT, and did not support other staples of the Judeo-Christian worldview. So uncomfortable did the papists feel about the scrolls that their contents didn't see the light of day for forty years, and even then it was via independent channels that things broke open. Although some scholars used the term "Essenes," there is no absolute proof confirming that the sect at Qumran, responsible for the writing and concealment of the scrolls, were originally known by this name.<br><br>  <br>**Teacher of Righteousness**  <br>The founder of the Qumran community, known to his disciples as the “Teacher of Righteousness,” was a Zadokite priest, hence a member of the legitimate and ultra-orthodox priestly class.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The Zadokites were the earliest "Jewish" priesthood, even though they were certainly not originally Israelites or Jews. Their mysterious leader, Melchizedek, met Abraham before the latter settled in Canaan.<br><br>  <br>When Simon was proclaimed “prince and high priest for ever,” and the office of high priest was irrevocably transferred from the Zadokites to the Hasmoneans, the Teacher of Righteousness left Jerusalem with a group of disciples and took refuge in the desert of Judah. In all probability the “Evil Priest” execrated in the Qumran texts was Simon; he had persecuted the Teacher of Righteousness in his exile and was even contemplating attacking Qumran when he was assassinated by the governor of Jericho.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Here we go again. It's the typical pattern. More conflict and antagonism among God's holy people. Time and again, throughout the whole of history, no one did Jews and Christians more harm than _themselves_.<br><br>  <br>The Qumran community was strictly monastic; the earliest Christians lived in the world, they made up a missionary community. Both sects were apocalyptic and messianic.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: But "messianic" means they awaited a physical liberator, not necessarily a son of god or heavenly savior. Their savior-messiah was not necessarily Paul's Jesus. The fanatical Qumran sect moved from Jerusalem to live remotely because they not only hated the Romans but also the many senior Jews of their community who collaborated with them. They were bitterly opposed to Romans, elite Jews and all Gentiles, wanting no truck with any of them. Note also that they were indubitably _ascetic_.<br><br>  <br>**Priestly Hierarchy at Qumran**  <br>The directing group was termed the _rabbîm_ (literally "the numerous”)...Twelve laymen and three priests formed the inner circle. The highest office was that of “inspector;” this supreme leader was bound to behave as a “shepherd.” His function is reminiscent of that of the “shepherd” or _episkopos_ among the Christians.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: So the upshot was that another obscure sect was discovered which influenced the early Christian movement. It was highly uncomfortable for top Christian scholars and biblicists to accept that their beloved religion was not as new or divinely "inspired" as they believed and announced. As said above, it was probably from this sect that the rite of baptism was adopted. We can wonder how many more motifs and traditions - such as communal feasts, breaking of bread, wilderness sojourns, fasting, the leader as Star, a suffering martyr, a fallen creation, a remote god, virgin birth, the Trinity, resurrecction, final apocalypse, etc - came from groups such as the Essenes, Mandeans, Stoics, Gnostics, Orphics, Pythagoreans, etc. Additionally, Professor Robert Feather has shown how close the ties were between the sect at Qumran and the Atonist solar cult of Egypt.|---|

|---|The Dead Sea Scrolls were the source of much controversy, and still are. Their content was suppressed by the Church for over 40 years, and the Church succeeded in discrediting honest whistle-blowers such as John Allegro. Allegro emphasized that in addition to ascetic practices and ritual purification, these sects imbibed powerful hallucinogenic potions, under the influence of which they had visions of an apocalypse. Too bad they didn't foresee what actually came to pass - the total destruction of Judea and their own community by the exasperated Romans.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|After the destruction of Qumran and the dispersal of the Essenes, some of those who escaped probably joined the Christian communities of Palestine. In any case, the apocalyptic and esoteric traditions were maintained in the Christianity of the first two centuries, and they encouraged certain Gnostic tendencies.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: More likely they were Gnostic tendencies already, and were summarily adopted by later Judeo-Christian sects. See the Book of Revelation for example.<br><br>  <br>**Despite the numerous resemblances that we have just mentioned, Essenism and primitive Christianity present different structures and pursue different ends.  <br>  <br>The Gaonim**  <br>The most important religious leader of the century, Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, who had strongly opposed the armed insurrection, was evacuated in a coffin during the siege of the city. Soon afterward he obtained leave from Titus to establish an elementary school at Jabneh, a village not far from Jaffa. It would be the founding of this school by Rabbi Johanan that would save the spiritual values of the Jewish people, conquered on the national plane and threatened with disappearance.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Of course there's much more to it than that, as I show in the _Irish Origins of Civilization._ The elite Pharisees and Sadducees who fled Judea, with the help of their Roman compatriots, set up rabbinical colleges in several cities of Mesopotamia and the Levant. The members of these secret colleges later reappeared in western cities, such as Lyon, Frankfurt, Zurich, Paris and London, etc, as the _Freemasons_. The letter G at the center of the Masonic diadem stands for Gaonim. Whatever was left of religious Judaism emanated from these locations, as did more secretive doctrines, such as the Kabala, a corpus synthesized by the Gaonim from Persian (Aryan) and Egyptian sources. It is, however, not wholly correct to define Masonry as "Jewish." Western masonry serves to conceal the presence of Setian-Atonists and Order of Melchizedek (Akhenaton), and has little in common with official Judaism or Christianity, which serve merely as convenient fronts for powerful and highly secretive ancient orders that once concealed their sinister identity and presence behind Pharasaic and Sadduccean movements in Judea. It was these nefarious orders which fled east with Roman help, not ordinary Jewish rabbis and lower level priests. I refer to this group - the Gaonim - as the "Eastern Illuminati" or as a major branch of it.|---|

|---|According all historians, the Sadducees (or Priesthood of Zadok) became extinct after the fall of the Temple in AD 70. However, what really happened is that during the Jewish Revolt and before the Roman crackdown on Judea, high level Pharisees and Sadducees were quietly allowed to escape to Babylon where they established "Rabbinical Colleges." Actually, these had little to do with Judaism, being refuges for the hidden funders of later groups such as Sabbateans, Frankists and _Illuminati_. In Judaism the hidden Luciferians are known as the Gaonim or "Princes of Light." After the suppression of the Knights Templars in the fourteenth century, members of the Gaonate re-entered western lands under the name Freemason or "Brothers (or Sons) of the Sun." They are in fact descended from Setian-Atonists whose interest in and connection with religious Judaism is purely incidental and subversive. Indeed, the latter order has long concealed itself behind many Christian societies and movements. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html) for more...)  <br>  <br>_Why is there also no trace in the entire Masonic ritual of Church Christianity? Why do the Masons not talk of the birth of Christ but, like the Jews, of the creation of the world? Why is there no Christian symbol in Freemasonry? Why the circle, the square and the scales? Why not the cross and other instruments of torture? Why not, instead of Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, the Christian trio: Faith, Charity, Hope?_ - Gotthold Salomon (Jewish Mason)|---|

|---|One of the symbols commemorating the "Jewish" connection to Masonry is the coffin. This motif puzzles most people, and all sorts of interpretations abound. It could represent the dead pharaoh Seqenenre Tao, murdered by the three brothers (the co-called _Jewes_); it could represent the death of Hiram Abiff, builder of the first Temple of Solomon, or it could be a reference to the Knights Templar who preceded Masonry. Or it might signify Yohanan ben Zakkai, the Jewish sage smuggled out of Judea at the height of the Roman crackdown in AD 70. The renowned rabbi was taken out of the city in a coffin. What better symbol and metaphor would be favored by the Gaonim to commemorate _their_ survival, that is of the Setian-Atonists who quickly established new headquarters in Babylon and elsewhere? _We left a dead city, a dead civilization, forgotten by all, yet we live again, thrice-born Princes of Light shining in the darkness_.

|---|**Delusion & Self-Sadism**  <br>Along with the great crisis that shook the Western Church,60 the fourteenth century is characterized characterized by a series of calamities and cosmic scourges: comets, solar eclipses, floods, and, above all, from 1347 on, the terrible epidemic of the plague, “the Black Death.” The processions of flagellants multiplied themselves in order to move God to pity.  <br>  <br>...proud of their self-torture, and despite their theological ignorance, the flagellants believed their activities could substitute for the charismatic and thaumaturgical powers of the Church.  <br>  <br>In order to expiate their sins and above all the sins of the world, itinerant lay groups traversed the countryside under the direction of a “master.” On arrival in a city, the procession - sometimes as large as several thousand people - made its way to the cathedral, chanting hymns and forming several circles. While sighing and crying, the penitents called upon God, Christ, and the Virgin, and began to flagellate themselves with such violence that their bodies became a swollen mass of bruised flesh.  <br>  <br>...the entire age seemed obsessed with death and with the sufferings that awaited the deceased in the afterworld. Death impressed the imagination more powerfully than the hope in the resurrection.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Eliade describes the antics and outlooks of but _one_ Christian sect. There are numerous others with similar ideas, not to mention openly Gnostic groups throughout Europe. There can be no question, given their presence, that Christianity  essentially  expounds an ascetic doctrine. For these types, death frees the body which exists in a perpetual state of pain in a fallen world.<br><br>  <br>“The cadaver is now everywhere, even on the tombstone.” The _danse macabre_ (“dance of death”), in which a dancer represents represents Death himself, drawing along men and women of all ages and classes (kings, monks, bishops, bourgeois, etc.) became a favorite subject in paintings and literature.  <br>  <br>**Female Sects**  <br>According to the trials of the Inquisition in Milan in 1384 and 1390, two women had acknowledged belonging to a society led by Diana Herodias.  <br>  <br>...Diana’s faithful had nothing in common with the makers of satanic _maleficia_. Most likely, their rites and visions were prolongations of an archaic fertility cult.|
