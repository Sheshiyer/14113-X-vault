| _The injection of Marxist tenets into Roman Catholicism is meant to undermine the economic and social structures of the lands where it is preached_ - Baron Avro Manhattan |     |

Who was the most important Pope of recent times? In the opinion of the great Avro Manhattan it was Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli.

|---|---|---|
|---|Pope Pius XII, who reigned from 1939 to 1958, was the last "conservative" pope. In his demented mind, atrocities of every kind were justified in the fight against the evils of Communism.|---|

The reason Baron Manhattan considered Pius XII so important is because of his attempt to form a close alliance between the Vatican and White House, in order to offset the threat of Communism and save Catholicism from extinction.  
  
Pius XII was deeply involved in fomenting both the first and second world wars. His objective was to overturn the Vatican-Moscow alliance crafted by his leftist predecessors after the Second World War. He was, however, successful only for a short time. He also intended to restore the Catholic Austro-Hungarian Empire which had, to the horror of the Papacy, been destroyed after the First World War. These intentions for the return of autocratic papal rule made Pius XII the implacable enemy of left-wing Jews, Orthodox Christians, Jesuits and Red Papists everywhere. The leaders of these groups knew that if Pius XII got his way, and if popes as right-wing as he continued to reign from Vatican City, the world of the near and far future was not going to take shape according to their liking. As far as they were concerned Pius XII had to be the last right-wing "non-progressive" potentate to occupy the chair of St. Peter.  
  
In his zeal to oppose the rise and spread of Communism, Pius XII signed agreements with Adolf Hitler, giving the Nazis papal support. Indeed, without this nod of approval, German Catholics would not have voted for Hitler, and the Nazi regime would have been nobbled from the start. Those in the "know" understand that without vocal papal support, the Nazis would never seen one day of power in Germany, and World War 2 would never have occurred. At no point in the twelve year reign of Nazi terror did the papacy under Pius utter a single critical word. How could it happen?  
  
After the Second World War, and spread of Communism throughout Europe and the world, powerful individuals within Holy See not only openly backed Communism, but secretly conceived a Socialism of their own, aimed at the subversion of existing political systems and the restoration total papal world control. Instead of a crude draconian Bolshevism despised by one and all, theirs was to be a relatively benign collectivist Socialism established with the approval of every slave under it. The resistance of men such as Pius XII - representing the old guard of autocrats - warned Red Papists to be careful and cunning when fomenting the particular kind of revolution they had in mind. With the death of Pius XII in 1958, a long era came to an end. From then on the Vatican's role in world affairs drastically changed, and those who opposed the swing to the left found themselves unable to return Catholicism to the way it had traditionally been, let alone improve it in healthy ways.  
  
The conflict between factions began because of a brute fact that stared the Vatican in the face. Traditional religious belief was sharply declining. Clearly the forthcoming age was one in which the new generation believed not in medieval "infallible" theology, but in humanity, science, materialism and intellectual progress. Since nothing could be done to assuage the tide of individualism, dissent and revolution, the Vatican decided to piggy-back on whatever political leviathan dominated the future, be it Fascism or Communism. Some bishops and cardinals favored one extreme, some the other. The means were less important to the Church than the end, that being the reinforcement and enhancement of its perfidious mental and social control, this time under a carefully crafted benign mask. Mistakes of the past had been well and truly learned, and were not going to be repeated. The "New World Order" a la Vatican was to be exactly that - a new order for a new world.

||LEFT: Pope John XXIII was born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli. Another "People's Pope," he replaced Pius XII after his death in 1958. He was an ardent left-wing or Red Papist who overturned many of his predecessor's policies and actively strengthened the Vatican-Moscow alliance. He was even favored as pope by Stalin himself, as well as by other Marxist leaders throughout the world. His opposition to Pius XII made him a favorite of the Kremlin. His election as pope came as a major blow to right-wing Papists. It meant that millions of Catholics throughout the world could now vote for Communist politicians without threat of excommunication and disgrace. Those extra votes were coveted by the leading left-wing politicians in every country, who did whatever it took to guarantee winning them. Conservatives decided to move toward the left in order to win them. And so, from 1960 on, world politics changed in ways that had hitherto been impossible. RIGHT: Pope Paul VI was born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini. A close friend of John XXIII, he reigned as pope from 1963 to 1978. He went out of his ​way to fill the Sacred College with leftist cardinals. His overtly "progressive" outlook warned anti-Communist Papists of things to come. His main ally was the pro-Communist Cardinal Benelli.||

From Baron Manhattan's revealing masterpiece _The Vatican-Moscow-Washington Alliance,_ we learn that in the years following the Second World War the cardinals and priests of Roman Catholicism were split between those who favored the spread of Communism and those who strongly opposed it. On the whole the Jesuit Order was in favor of the spread of classic Bolshevik-style revolution, and played a major part in extreme leftist movements throughout the world, particularly in Latin America. They continue to be a force behind the spread of Socialism, but since the 1980s their tactics have changed somewhat, and they now tend to not be as extreme in their views and actions, at least not openly. The reasons for this are varied and interesting. In short, they were willing to give up their extremism for the right price, one that was eventually paid. However, before the Jesuits were brought to heel by the more powerful cadre of Red Papists, some of their head men, including the Black Pope himself, Pedro Aruppe, were openly or covertly assassinated. These "removals" sounded a warning that dissent over the new radical strategy was not going to be tolerated.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...the Jesuits totally ignored the warnings from Pope John Paul II to cease their subversive activities because of their determination to pursue the policies of the old Vatican-Moscow alliance with its advocacy of direct revolutionary involvement. When finally president Reagan, and behind him the Pentagon, insisted that the Church should control the Jesuits or else, the presidential warning produced a papal hurricane against the Jesuits_ - Baron Avro Manhattan  <br>  <br>_The Jesuits' pursuance of the discarded policies of the former Vatican-Moscow alliance and their defiance against the new policies of the Vatican-Washington alliance brought the anger of Pope John Paul II upon their heads in a manner they had not experienced for centuries...Their General was dismissed and openly scolded, indeed "publicly humiliated" by the Pope_ - ibid  <br>  <br>_The Jesuits were ordered to change their tactics. They coined slogans more appropriate to the "present conditions;" the words "radical" and "revolution" with such euphemisms as "profound renewals" or "innovating changes," or "social renovation"_ - ibid|

A great deal of the Red Papacy's vast wealth comes from Jesuit-controlled Latin America. The natural resources of Latin American countries was not efficiently exploited until sophisticated machinery was imported in the 1940s. After this point the Vatican's wealth soared. Their power strengthened again, power lost to them after the collapse of the arch-Catholic Austro-Hungarian Empire, and loss of Mexico under Emperor Maximilian. By way of their newly acquired wealth the Latin American Jesuits were able to insinuate agents into the League of Nations and United Nations which succeeded it, thereby changing the course of world events to suit their own agendas. It is thanks to Latin America's industry that the Red Papacy has been able to rise to power, insinuate its agents into the U. S. Government, manipulate world administrations, and regain control of the world. The Red Papacy are the absolute over-arching architects of control and geopolitical puppet-masters. Whatever events transpire on the sociopolitical stage must be analyzed with this fact firmly in mind.

||LEFT: Pope John Paul II replaced John Paul I after his assassination by agents of the Vatican-White House alliance. He reigned as pope from 1978 to 2005. RIGHT: The Black Pope and head Jesuit Pedro Arrupe was assassinated in 1991 by order of John Paul II and his confederates in the US government. He and his Jesuits had become something of an embarrassment to the new Red Papists who shied away from appearing extreme leftists. The hardline Socialism of the Jesuits suited the poor and downtrodden, particularly in countries south of the equator. It was not as suitable for the middle and upper-middle classes of north-western climes. This is why the Jesuits were eventually compelled to fall in line with the intrigues of the Red Papacy. Those who refused were removed and replaced.||

Baron Manhattan points out that both John Paul I and John Paul II were glove-puppets of the opposing factions whose long fight for dominance finally came to a head in 70s and 80s. In revenge for the killing of John Paul I, after only thirty three days in office, the hardliner Communist faction of cardinals and bishops attempted to have John Paul II shot to death. This event occurred on May 13, 1981, right in St. Peter's Square.

||On May 13, 1981 John Paul II was shot four times by the Turkish patriot Mehmet Ali Agca, who was immediately caught and jailed. He was subsequently pardoned by the Italian President and forgiven by the pope. What a perfect publicity stunt. John Paul trained to be an actor and was far more interested in acting than being pope. He had been turned down for ecclesiastical posts by seniors who knew his heart wasn't in the job. It was primarily because of the influence of his secret adviser Bishop Deskur that he finally rose to occupy the chair of St. Peter. He was profoundly arrogant and narcissistic and coveted the limelight. His hidden masters had him travel far and wide, gaining worldwide media attention. It was all part of the plan. John Paul II's brand of Socialism was a modification of that preferred by his predecessor John XXIII, but the headquarters of the new ideology was to be centered in Vatican City not Moscow. This was the first step to insinuate Vatican-approved Shadow-Communism ​into the west. It found countless adherents in the world's governments, and its proponents are responsible for most of what we see taking place in the sociopolitical world. (See Manhattan's _Vatican-Moscow-Washington Alliance_, for the story of the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II.)||

Baron Manhattan reveals that the leftist members of the Curia (or Roman Circle) wanted to manufacture a brand of Marxist-Socialism all their own, in case Bolshevism ever overstepped itself, crumbled, or was destroyed by its enemies. Their alliances with Soviet Russia and other Communist countries - initiated after the First World War and Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 - were expedient means to this end. But it was not their intention to continue propounding perfidious Bolshevik Communism. It provided a rough template that needed lots of improvement and upgrading for the modern age by much more intelligent and cunning minds. The decision to design a new improved version of Socialism was made for purely pragmatic reasons. It was all about longevity and survival. Baron Manhattan stresses that the allegiances and machinations of the opposing factions within the Vatican, were always selfish, and never about the good of humanity. From their new high-horse the Red Papists could, not only in the name of Christ, but of Socialism, cajole the various decadent western governments over their faustian policies and actions, all the while looking good in the eyes of moderates and liberals everywhere. What a make-over they achieved for themselves, which after centuries of heinous crimes and debauchery was sorely needed.

||_…the Catholic Church, consumed by Cimmerian dreams of formidable expansion, is biding her time to enforce her dominion upon the human race. Not only as a spiritual, but also as a political power, buttressed by the unshakable conviction that it is her destiny to conquer the planet_ - Baron Avro Manhattan (_Catholic Imperialism and World Freedom_)  <br>  <br>_Her opposition to world revolution is not caused by her wish to save the freedom of the world, but by her wish to continue her old fight against the freedom of the world_ - ibid|

This change of strategy by the Vatican did not mean the patriarchs of that city state were giving up their ecclesiastical status. It did not mean the Pope was becoming less authoritarian or megalomaniacal. His predecessors had made it clear time and again that all human beings on the planet, as well as all kings and emperors, were merely underlings, and that each and every person's soul could be saved only if they were unquestionably prostrate before the Chair of St. Peter and the regent sitting on it:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Popes have received sovereignty not only Pontifical but royal, and the Empire not only of heaven but of Earth...Outside the Church there is no building save Hell, and there exists no power ordained by God_ - Pope Innocent IV  <br>  <br>_The Roman Pontiff, constituted by God, above Kings and Kingdoms, is the supreme hierarch of the Church militant, and has obtained principality over all mortal men_ - (From _De Romano Pontifice_)  <br>  <br>_We declare, define, establish and decree that every human creature, under the rigid necessity of saving his soul, must be subject to the Roman Pontiff_ - Pope Boniface VIII|

Of course not too many people suspect that such an alliance was contemplated and executed by the Holy See, since obviously Communism professes atheism. But this is just what occurred. Economically and politically atheism was not a matter that phased the Red Papists. And after all, the Soviets had cultivated good working relations with the Orthodox Church. The same went for other Communist countries in Eastern Europe, where Communism and Christianity coexisted and cooperated. No, what mattered most was _political_ rather than theological survival, and since it was apparent to the Holy See that Socialism of some kind was bound to win the world, the cunning bishops and cardinals had to choose sides while they still had the chance. Baron Manhattan shows that this had been the policy of the Church for centuries. But in the early twentieth century the situation was so urgent that even if an antagonistic pope or two had to be removed and sacrificed, it simply had to be done. Certainly Karl Marx had described religion as the "opium of the people." But what of it? The cardinals knew this fact centuries before Communism was invented. Moreover, Lenin was less obsessive. He threw the Church a bone when he publicly said that religion was a private affair.  
  
It was the cue the Red Papists or Shadow-Communists had been waiting for. It was an opportunity not to be missed. The game was now on, and the Red Papists put their plan for restoration into operation. Until the rise of Fascism in Italy and Germany they had things their own way. As we said the Jesuits even went so far as to take up extreme left-wing positions in countries they were subverting. This position gave them the clout they needed to withstand opposition from Russia and particularly from western powers. It gave them the ideological arsenal they needed to not only supervise and counter western powers, but eventually to morally and politically undermine them.

||_By adopting a Catholicized Marxism, the Catholic Church has launched into the contemporary world the most insidiously destructive religio-ideological imponderable the like of which has never been seen since the emergence of either Bolshevism or Fascism. Its contribution to the near future will be not only the destabilization of the balance of power between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, but equally the mounting exacerbation of the conflict_ - Baron Avro Manhattan||

His masters had him align himself with the leftist Solidarity workers movement of his native Poland, in order to make him popular to ordinary liberal-minded folks indoctrinated into thinking of him as a genuinely caring people's champion, seeking redress and justice for all. The ruse worked a like a charm.\\|||

The idea was to become better advocates of Marxist-Socialism than the cruel extremist Bolsheviks. Socialism was the way forward, even if it was reluctantly endorsed and backed by ostensibly liberal politicians and interests in Britain and America. Most western Capitalists hated and feared the Bolshevik variety of hard Communism, but were not so concerned and threatened by the new improved brand concocted by the Red Papists of Vatican City.  
  
The fact that Socialism is patently _atheistic_ didn't disturb the love fest. It was a sticking point best not brought to the table. Why disturb the Realpolitik?  
  
So the decision to back hard Communism was never wholehearted on the part of the Red Papacy. It was favored only by the Jesuits who would be forced to go along with the new policy, come what may. It would not be an easy task because opposition to the plan, from Pius XII and other ardent right-wingers was relentless. But we cannot understand the present sociopolitical world until we grasp the significance of this rivalry. It accounts for almost every major political decision made since the death of John Paul I. It also helps us to determine the true nature of the allegiances and views expressed by this or that public figure. When we listen to statements made by Father Coughlin, Henry Ford, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy, George Bush, Zbigniew Brzezinski, George Soros, Bill Clinton, Donald Rumsfeld, Bob Geldof, Bono, Russell Brand, Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro, Lech Walesa, Newt Gingrich, Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair or Prince Charles, how do we correctly analyze what is being said and implied? Are their comments good for humanity in general, or will they lead to disaster?

Who's telling the truth? What should we believe?  
What's it all about? Is that an insider-smile?  

Perhaps the Red Papists saw the future, and concluded that the hard variety of Socialism purveyed by the Bolsheviks had little hope of continuing. It had too many powerful enemies and was rotten from within. After all, feuds raged between Communist enclaves throughout Europe and the world. There were incendiary disagreements between the Soviets and Fidel Castro in Cuba, Marshall Tito in Yugoslavia, Mao in China, and so on. There was also the fact that the Catholics weren't too hot on the Jewish presence within Bolshevism. The members of the Vatican gang didn't want to be outdone and out-numbered by a gang of super-wealthy Jews who had sacked the many nations under their ruthless dominion. The Jewish-Communists had vast armies at their disposal, while the Vatican had none to speak of. Jews had prospered enormously by crushing Russia and other lands under the name of Communism, and were becoming the primary, if hidden, power in many key fields throughout the world. The Red Papists also understood that because of the spread of Bolshevik-style Communism, their very existence was threatened. In ten or twenty years, after most young adults had been indoctrinated by Communist ideology, religion of every variety, especially that disseminated from Rome, was likely to be dismissed as reactionary, irrelevant and dispensable. Eventually there might even be a more radical expression of dissent from within the ranks. All over the world young priests (and Jesuits) were already ardently espousing left-wing beliefs and views. What if they turned from religion completely? What if they bit the hand that fed them? Yes, it was too worrying and precarious. Something had to be done to prevent disaster.

||A mere 69 days into his presidency, Ronald Reagan was nearly shot ​to death in Washington DC. The date was May 30, 1981. The would-be assassin was John Hinckley. He was caught and sentenced to life in prison. Who masterminded the plot? Was it those who objected to Reagan's close ties to the Papacy? Was it hardline Communists who objected to the Red Papacy's attempt to foment a counter-revolution of their own, and thereby situate the headquarters of "Catholic Socialism" in Rome rather than Moscow?||

Although the policies and agenda of the Red Papists had been resisted by Pius XII, things took a turn for the worse as time went by. A direct phone line was installed in the White House, so Ronald Reagan could converse regularly with Pope John Paul II, after his inauguration. In other words, the game was afoot. The old brand of Bolshevik Communism was rejected, and the new brand of Shadow-Communism accepted and promoted. The right-wing image adopted by Ronald Reagan served as perfect camouflage for the rise to power of the Red Papacy.  
  
Baron Manhattan informs us of a previous setback for the extremist faction within the Vatican. After the rise of Mussolini and Hitler in Italy and Germany, pro-Communist Papists were forced underground. To their horror a pact was signed between Hitler and Pope Pius XI, known as the Lateran Treaty. For a while, for followers of Pius XII, it looked as if all was right with the world. Indeed, without the Catholic vote Hitler would never have been able to come to power, despite the fact that Germany is traditionally a Protestant country. What does this tell us about other lands such as Vietnam, China, Japan, Korea, India, Africa, and so on, where, as Baron Manhattan assures us, the hidden hand of the Vatican is at work?

||In 1929, Pius XI and Benito Mussolini (Fascist dictator of Italy) signed the Lateran Treaty. The pro-Fascist cabal at the Vatican gained a temporary victory over the pro-Communist Papists, at least until the end of the war. After signing, Mussolini restored to the Church many previously rescinded rights, as well as the Papal States and other properties previously seized in 1867 by the Italian crown. He awarded the Vatican and its agents complete political and legal neutrality. All in all it was a great day for the Vatican. Pius XI's subsequent retraction and denunciation of the Nazis and the treaty was a major setback for Pius XII and other opponents of Communism who formulated and backed the Lateran Treaty. Before he could issue his denunciation of Fascism to the world, Pius XI was covertly murdered, probably by order of Pius XII who succeeded him ​as pope.  <br>  <br>Mussolini's heinous act showed humanity that Fascism can be as dangerous as Communism. Publicly supplying additional powers to the Papacy would be the last thing on the mind of anyone truly concerned with the physical and spiritual welfare of the human race.||

LEFT: President Richard Nixon. RIGHT: President Ronald Reagan. Like George Bush and other presidents before them, they took their instructions from representatives of the Shadow-Communists at the Vatican. By not means were any of these traitors genuine conservatives. Nixon, Bush and Reagan worked with the CIA and the Vatican to smuggle Nazis and Croatian fascist (Ustasi) killers to safety in America, Britain and South America. This was at the behest of the papacy, the expert manipulators of the world stage, playing right against left, Nazi against Communist, rich against poor, for their own sinister empowerment. The three American presidents, along with their CIA co-conspirators, were ordered to destroy records that recorded secret deals between the papacy and the fascists of Germany and Croatia. Also suppressed was the evidence showing that a great bulk of the Nazi loot had been transferred to the Vatican from Switzerland at the close of World War II. Although done in the name of anti-Communism, we see that the Red Papists weren't truly adverse to Communism. That was just the expedient stance which enabled their vile deeds against humanity to receive the stamp of approval from authentic anti-Communist leaders. The papacy dons whatever hat suits the occasion. In this way their agents are warmly received by courts and governments of every political extreme. The complete legal immunity enjoyed by envoys, priests, bishops and cardinals, allows them to move sensitive documents, cash, gold and jewels to all corners of the globe without search or suspicion. Thus, the Vatican's spy network is second to none. As Baron Manhattan shows, it is this sovereign unaccountable leviathan that directs world events and decides which of their loyal deputies finds himself elected to political power.  
  
Nixon's speeches were ghostwritten by the Jesuit Reverend John McLaughlin. Reagan spoke regularly by phone with his bosom buddy Pope John Paul II, who shamelessly backed extremist Catholic mass murderers in Croatia, South America and elsewhere. The Red Papists were intent on ingratiating themselves with western demagogues and frequently looked the other way when atrocities were committed by the latter. In some cases, they even endorsed acts of war and terror perpetrated by western governments. More disastrously, they saw to it that men under their control assumed top positions in major western political institutions, security orgs and financial corporations. Baron Manhattan shows the extent of the Vatican's financial wealth and global power in his masterpiece _Vatican Billions._ In the run up to his election, Ronald Reagan told the American people that if he was elected he was going to fight for families "...in the spirit of John Paul II." He said "...I reaffirm to you my pledge, in the spirit of Pope John Paul II, that I will do all I can to see that common good is once more ​the true goal of decision making." Without the votes of America's Catholics, Reagan had no chance of becoming president. He was the Vatican's man, like so many before and after him. By 1984, the Vatican-Washington alliance was signed, sealed and delivered by all concerned.  

Pius XI eventually recanted his allegiance with the Nazis. Although he did not become openly Communist, he decided he had been wrong to think of the Nazi alliance as being better for Vatican interests. Then, as the Axis powers faced defeat, Pius XI and others did an about-face and aligned themselves with Britain and America. This was of course a disaster for the hardliner pro-Communist Papists who fought to regain their power in the years that followed. They rose to power again openly in 1976 when the Italian Communist Party dominated the nation's political scene. The Party was strongly supported and directed behind the scenes by Pope John VI. Due to his machinations, the Italian government was infested with hardliner Communists. Rome's mayor at the time, Giulio Argan, was a avowed Marxist. Moscow was delighted. As Baron Manhattan said, Rome and the Eternal City had become bastions of Communism.

Their embezzlement and fraud was a response to the rise of the Red Papacy. Calvi, Gelli, and ​their associates in the right-wing Freemasonic P2 lodges of Italy, were outraged by the changes they saw happening in Rome and the rest of the country.

According to informed researchers, the Vatican was undoubtedly the destination of the bulk of the Nazi billions stashed away in Swiss banks which had to be moved once the Allies approached Germany toward the end of World War II. Some of the wealth was transported to Belgian banks (a country dominated by the Catholic branch of the "Black Nobility"), while the bulk crossed over into Italy. One of the main architects of this treasonous act was Allen Dulles, director of the CIA. ([Here](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-War-Against-Jews-Espionage/dp/0312156480) for more on the infamous Dulles-Vatican conspiracy...)||

Pius XII backed the Nazis and Italian Fascists to ensure the Vatican's survival in an age of secularism, revolution and agnosticism. He also supported the Nazis because he genuinely believed Hitler would attack Soviet Russia and wipe the abomination of Communism from the face of the earth. This was one of the main reasons why right-wing Papists formulated the Lateran Treaty. We can only wonder what would have happened had Hitler's Operation Barbarossa been successful. Communism, Jesuitism and Red Papism might have bothered the world no more. There might never have been a decades long Cold War, and many lands in the Far East would not have been in a position to threaten the west.

Another coincidence that without support from Mussolini (agent of the Jesuits) and from the Catholic Party in Germany, Hitler would never have been heard of. Like Mussolini, Hitler hastened to make binding agreements with the Vatican.  <br>  <br>With Vatican approval, Catholic men in Bavaria flocked to become members of Hitler's Brown-Shirts. To a man they were, like their leader, haters of Protestantism, Democracy, and a great deal besides.  <br>  <br>Actually, like Mussolini before him (and guided by Vatican agents such as Franz von Papen and Monsignor Kass) Hitler simply executed the will of Pius XII, who, like his papal predecessors, burned with hatred against Prussia and Germany for becoming Protestant, thereby denying the papacy its age-old control over the country.  <br>  <br>Adolf Hitler did not save and strengthen Germany. On the contrary, he destroyed it. He was a British and Red Papist agent from day one. His job - as envisioned by men like Pius XII - was to prevent _legitimate_ right-wing forces coming to power, those seeking to destroy Communism (and Socialism) within Germany and elsewhere. It was the same policy underway in Spain under Franco. Hitler's mission was the complete destruction of Germany; a process that had been in the works from before the Franco-Prussian and first world wars. This is why the Nazi experiment failed as it was meant to fail. It accounts for the flagrant misrepresentation of the term "Aryan," and for the promotion of bogus Ariosophy. It accounts for the millions of deutsche marks that mysteriously awaited Hitler in Berlin, his conspicuously shortened prison sentence and the popularity of his book _Mein Kampf._ It accounts for why the word "Socialist" appears in the Nazi party's title, and why Hitler attended the funeral of leading revolutionary Jewish-Communist Kurt Eisner. It explains the heinous "Night of the Long Knives," and presence within the Nazi Party of British agents such as Hjalmar Schacht, Karl Haushofer, Admiral Canaris, and others. It accounts for the marginalization, removal and covert murder of true Germans such as Erich von Ludedorff, Field Marshall Erwin Rommel, and others, and the otherwise inexplicable coldness toward Sir Oswald Mosley, the British Fascist leader. It accounts for the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact, the disastrous Operation Barbarossa, and failure to deal the deathblow to Allied forces at Dunkirk. It accounts for the leniency toward wealthy Jews after Hitler's initial rise to power, the Haavara Agreement, and leniency towards Jewish Freemasonic lodges, while age-old Germanic lodges were closed. It explains the importation of thousands of German Communists previously stationed in Russia as part of the Hitler-Stalin pact. It accounts for Rudolf Hess's secret flight to England and for the close ties between the Nazis and American and British bankers. It also accounts for the planned and expected seizure of East Germany and many other neighboring countries by Communists at the war's end, and for the decades long Cold War. It accounts for the secret collusion between top Nazis and Islamic leaders, such as the Grand Mufti of Egypt. Most importantly, it accounts for the destruction, by way of planned mass ritual murder, of the best Anglo-Saxon blood - British _and_ German.  <br>  <br>_Hitler, Goebbels, Himmler, and most members of the party’s ‘old guard’ were Catholics -_ M. F. Hoffet  <br>  <br>_It is no mere coincidence that the last two German Chancellors prior to Hitler's assumption of power were Catholics...and the intimate friends of the Papal Nuncio. It is also no mere coincidence that both strove to rule with Hitler, indeed, not only did they invite him to share their Governments, but it was chiefly thanks to them that Hitler was finally asked to form a Government...At the head of the new Germany, and second only to Hitler, there stood the German Vice-Chancellor, the Leader of the Catholic Party, the personal friend of Pacelli (Pius XII), the Papal Knight Franz von Papen_ - Avro Manhattan (_Catholic Imperialism_)  <br>  <br>_Adolf Hitler was a Catholic. Acting as leader of the German state, he signed a concordant with the Vatican in 1934 in which it was agreed that he would restore Church privilege and protect Church assets in Germany in return for Roman Catholic political endorsement and support_ - Richard Kelly Hoskins (_In the Beginning_)  <br>  <br>No wonder that, after the end of the war, the man placed in charge of taxing Germany's Protestant landowners of their wealth (to pay war trumped-up war debts) was Catholic finance minister Matthias Erzberger. No wonder that after the war years, General Erich von Ludendorff openly stated that Germany's fall and ruin was undoubtedly due to the intrigues of Masons, Jews, and above all, _Jesuits_.<br><br>---||

The hardliners took a certain amount of consolation when, at the end of the war, the Soviets overran numerous devastated European countries, setting up their oppressive draconian Eastern bloc. The Soviets maintained a large force of armed men for years after the end of the war, and spending billions they managed to seize Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, as well as Cuba, Angola, China, North Korea and North Vietnam. Hardliners and Red Papists alike breathed sighs of relief. Their agents were able to move about unrestricted by the Communist leaders of these plundered lands, even though there were severe reprisals against right-wing priests and clerics. Baron Manhattan was one of the few historians to monitor these crimes and publish accounts of them in his outstanding books.  
  
Because of the fast, furious and largely unhindered spread of Communism throughout the world, after the Second World War, the pro-Communist factions within the Church, and Jesuit Order, went over the top in their support of Communistic policies and causes. It was not a clever move because it only helped identify them to their enemies in the US and elsewhere. At some point the Vatican realized that the Bolshevik form of Communism, propagated in so many conquered lands, was irredeemably corrupt and unsustainable. Ultimately, the future of humanity was not hard to predict for men of this caliber. The image of the Vatican was tarnished because of Catholicism's close links with ruthless Communist regimes. The extremist orientation had to be downplayed if people were to continue trusting the Church. And so moderate cardinals were able to put their long-term schemes to work. The alliance between the Vatican and the White House was made top priority, and sealed during the reign of John Paul II. Pius XII rolled and groaned in his grave.

||The Berlin Wall is torn down. The year was 1989. What led to this remarkable moment in history, the sudden fall of Communism throughout Europe? Was it a spontaneous and legitimate people's revolution, or was it due to long laid plans finally being triggered by exceptionally powerful hidden forces? More importantly, did it signal the death throes of Communism? Sadly, the answer is no. The fall of the Berlin Wall and disintegration of Bolshevik-style Communism didn't mean the end of Socialism. Far from it. The Red Papists simply reoriented themselves and designed a new improved brand of Communism customized to suit the times.||

The pact between the Shadow-Communists or Red Papists and the US Government, led to the disintegration of the Communist Eastern bloc, and eventually to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Pius XII died in 1958, which means he did not live to see the fall of the original perfidious form of Communism and rise of the new stronger and more insidious popular form of Papist-approved Socialism that would succeed where the former had not.  

In light of this, it is not difficult to understand why the policies of John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul II, were originally resented and resisted by most Jesuits. The latter were far more extreme in their revolutionary zeal, and did not see the fall of the Eastern bloc as a good and necessary thing. As far as they were concerned their existence and relevance depended on the continuation of the Cold War. Their brand of Marxist-Catholicism had won them enviable power, and they were not ecstatic about having to give it up or tolerate popes who demanded a less conspicuous approach to world politics. It was with some difficulty that the Red Papists brought the Jesuits to heel. The Jesuits did not wish to breed a spirit of reconciliation between Capitalist and underprivileged and third-world countries. The had garnered considerable allegiance from the masses of underprivileged lands because of this stark opposition. To engender a moderate political climate meant undermining their significance and strength. After all, world events were going their way. In the 1950s Capitalist America had been engaged in the Korean War, and in the 60s it was involved in the unpopular Vietnam War. Both conflicts aroused great hostility not only in people of a left-wing persuasion but in moderates as well. As far as the Jesuits were concerned the rise of anti-Americanism on so many fronts was manna from heaven. Capitalism was being dealt blow after blow, and might in the end fall never to rise again. The end was in sight, so why deflect it with unnecessarily friendly overtures toward the decadent US? The Jesuits saw their hold over Catholic Latin American tightening because of this spreading anti-Americanism, and there was no way they were about to sacrifice that control. If their control had to be lessened or relinquished, the price had to be right. And, as the years passed, that is just what happened. To instigate Communism, a la Red Papacy, the Jesuits have had to release their control over Latin America and align with Washington, the White House seeing to it that their Red Papist confederates are given a greater say in world affairs. Ironically they have done so without a completely clear picture of what the future is to look like with these cunning allies in the driving seat.  
  
Eventually the Jesuits (directed by the Red Papacy) installed their double-agent, Cardinal Francis Spellman, right in the center of the action, directing presidents Kennedy and Nixon toward greater and greater mishaps and human-rights violations. As far as the Jesuits were concerned, if Catholicism was to make headway in the Far East, in countries such as China, Vietnam, Malaysia and India, the West had to be perpetually demonized, something the Jesuit Order excelled at doing. In Vietnam, chaos reigned over the installation of the US-backed dictator President Diem. After his assassination, the Communists nearly took hold of South Vietnam, and Communism was certainly strengthened in North Vietnam as the war fury in the region escalated. President Diem was murdered at the behest of the CIA and the ambassador to South Vietnam, Averell Harriman, who as a senior Skull and Bones man, took his orders directly from Cardinal Spellman.

American politics continues to be supervised and directed by advisers from Georgetown University, Fordham University, Boston College, and other Jesuit-controlled institutions such as the Council on Foreign Relations. In the early '80s, after some resistance, the Jesuits eventually fell in line with the Red Papists, realizing that phase one of their master-plan had succeeded, and that a new more moderate tactic was indeed required, if the subversion ​of western Capitalism was to successfully continue.||

The first feelings of goodwill toward new Vatican relations began during World War I. When it appeared that the Allies would emerge as victors, the Vatican began passive cooperation with the US, as a useful intelligence transmitter...At the height of the European crisis, President Roosevelt surreptitiously bypassed the 1867 ban by sending a "personal representative" to the Vatican on the grounds that it gave America "a good listening post"...On October 1951, President Truman, eager to enlist the growing Catholic vote, stunned even his own party, along with the rest of the US, only hours before the recess of the Senate, by announcing the nomination of a US ambassador to the Vatican...Early in 1984, the US established full diplomatic relations with the Vatican, ending 116 years of diplomatic vacuum. The step took America by surprise...The process began during the Cold War after World War II, when minor and major nations started to woo the Holy See. It continued after the Vatican-Moscow alliance which followed. Countries which preceded the US move included Finland and Denmark in 1982, and Sweden in 1983. Even England, after four and a half centuries, reestablished diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1982. In less than two decades, the Vatican had been recognized as a predominant diplomatic center by more than 120 nations...  
  
...When the US was born, the pope was king of a large territory in central Italy known as the Papal States. Yet the US government totally ignored the Vatican both as a state and even more as a church. In 1797, the young American nation commissioned an Italian citizen, B. Sartori, to represent her interests in the Vatican. Fifty years later, President Polk, owing to increased problems with the Papal States, opened diplomatic relations with the Vatican. Resentment in the US began to build immediately and soon the forced closing of a Presbyterian church in Rome caused Congress to end the relations. Finally, in 1867, at the instance of the _New York Times,_ a law ​was passed forbidding any government funding for a Vatican ambassador. Three years later the Papal States disappeared when they were forcibly annexed by a reunited Kingdom of Italy which made Rome its official Capital. This ended the secular status of the pope as head of state. Subsequent attempts to reestablish diplomatic relations failed mostly because of active resistance of the Protestant establishment - Baron Avro Manhattan

Spellman's supposed right-wing stance, and opposition toward the spread of Communism in the Far East, worked to soften the attitude of the White House toward the Jesuit presence in Latin America. It bought the Jesuits time to align themselves with the Red Papacy, without losing their considerable power in Latin America, power that had been established over centuries and might have been gradually lost to Protestant America if relations between the North and South improved diplomatically and commercially. This had been the Jesuit's fear from the drafting of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and slow southward territorial acquisition of the North Americans. At the outbreak of the First World War, the Jesuits were horrified when numerous Latin American countries sided with North America and broke ties with Germany. They saw their control waning considerably and knew something had to be done. To maintain a stringent left-wing stance would certainly lead to a catastrophe for them once the war came to an end when North America's economic power would be vaster than it had been from its inception as a nation.  
  
Another reason why the Jesuits were loathe to distance themselves from the Soviets had to do with their excellent intelligence gathering operations. They were able to combine their age-old capacity for espionage with the comparably formidable secret worldwide spy networks established by Stalin and previous Soviet leaders. This apparatus was an asset that would not be easily and willingly sacrificed.

||LEFT: Harold Laski. RIGHT: The psychopathic Stalinist V. K. Krishna Menon was promoted by Prime Minister Nehru to India's Minister of Defense. So much for the neutrality of India after achieving its so-called "independence" in 1947. Officially a pacifist, Menon promptly armed India to the teeth, and pushed for tight diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. But where did Nehru find Menon? In London's School of Economics. Menon was trained by the notorious Fabian Harold Laski. His Marxist views influenced most of Britain's leftist politicians from the 1930s on. Laski served as Chairman of the British Labor Party from 1945 to 1946, and was the most eminent political intellectual in Britain for some time. The first president of a "free" India, Nehru, was an admirer of Laski, which is why he sought out and hired Menon. Laski was a executive member of the Fabian Party for over ten years, and was closely associated with the Frankfurt School. He made certain that the leftist political-scientist Franz Leopold Neumann was promoted. The Jewish Neumann played a key role in the Nuremberg Trials, supervising and amending the prosecution cases against Nazi defendants such as Alfred Rosenberg and Hermann Goering, etc. Neumann was a senior member of the Rockefeller Foundation. After his death, Neumann's wife married arch Neo-Marxist Herbert Marcuse, Laski's closest friend. Through these overtly Marxist thinkers, the Shadow-Communist plan for world domination was invented and facilitated. That these men were often avowed atheists did not stop them creating an alliance with the Red Papacy. The Shadow-Communists are careful to conceal their presence and true agenda from the public. This is one reason they've been so successful. Indeed, since the end of the Second World War, almost every teacher and professor in Indian schools, colleges and universities has been a card-carrying Marxist. This remains the case today.||

As we said above, the Pro-Communists, Red Papists and Jesuits were not keen on losing world control to Jews and Zionists. Most Bolsheviks were Jewish, but unlike Zionists they were not Capitalists, so there was no problem dealing with them. The problem was with ardent-Zionists pushing for a separate homeland in Palestine, and with their sympathizers in the Jewish and Gentile worlds. As far as the Jesuits were concerned, Zionism had to be kept at bay. It was another branch of Capitalism and neither Zionism nor Israel could exist without vast sums from Capitalist countries. What is more, Zionists lured Jews to Israel from Russia and other European countries, turning them from moderates into right-wingers, and often turning them from religion to atheism or alternatively to Jewish messianism. The religious Zionist wanted to win the world for Jehovah, not Christ. All in all, Jesuits are not impressed when any nation raises its people above a medieval level of intellectual and social development. It means losing control over their minds and political leanings, and in the case of Zionism it means that pro-Zionist Jews are far less approving of Rome's neo-Marxist ideology.  
  
Some extremists within Soviet Russia and other Communist countries realized Rome's predicament and sought to strengthen Zionism for their own purposes. During Stalin's reign, the Soviets attempted to downplay the Jewish role in Communism, and as a result they supported Jewish immigration to Israel. Other countries followed suit, simply to be rid of their own Jewish populations. The Jesuits could only look on in horror. The rise of Israel was a major hitch in their plans for the future of the world. From the 1950s on, they've had to work harder to recruit Jewish intellectuals and activists to their dastardly cause. The only good to come out of it, was that Jesuit agents were able henceforth to blame Zionists for any and all conspiracies and upheavals that occur throughout the world, many of their (the Jesuits) making. The Catholic conspiratorial hand has been at work longer than the Zionist hand. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html) for more...)

||Like Gentiles, Jews are split into contingents of rich and poor, privileged and humble. religious and atheistic. The privileged tend to lean toward right-wing politics, hence the rise of Zionism and Neo-Conservatism. With this in mind, we see that while left-wing Jews (the majority) cheered the Papacy's turn toward Socialism, right-wingers and Zionists (the minority of Jews) probably saw the change as problematic and even spurious. Conversely, the Jesuits were not thrilled by the rise of Zionism and Neo-Conservatism, which are essentially right-wing and Capitalistic. Indeed the Zionist state of Israel could simply not exist without enormous donations from the world's richest Jews and Gentiles. For those intent on fomenting world revolution (workers against the wealthy), Zionism and Neo-Conservatism were nothing but obscene impediments. Jesuits and Red Papists worried that the stronger Zionism became, and the more converts it won to its cause, the less chance they had of succeeding in their own geopolitical intrigues. Consequently the Jesuits and their Gentile agents started assiduously backing the Palestinian cause. They are also responsible for the rise of Islamo-Communism, the great world-threat of the future.  <br>  <br>The Middle-East conflict has been needlessly prolonged because of the Jesuits and their covert opposition to Zionism. Ironically, some of the most powerful and wealthy Jews, such as the Rothschilds, were instrumental in the rise of the Red Papacy. Jewish dynasties are themselves divided over their allegiances. Some align with and finance Zionism, while others are in sympathy with the neo-Marxist Red Papacy. The fact is that all Jewish societies and aspirations survived to the present day because of the secret patronage of the Crown and the Cross. Judaism would long ago have been wiped from the face of the earth if the Crown and Holy See desired that end. The Red Papacy may not like the overt Capitalism of the average Zionist, but they have more to lose by actively denouncing Zionists, who are bound to retaliate (as well-meaning Protestants once did) by dragging the Vatican's crimes through their synagogues and headlines. This is certainly not in the Red Papacy's interest, and so a truce of sorts has been decided upon. To overtly cajole Zionists brings the Red Papacy into conflict with the White House which wholeheartedly supports Zionism and Israel. This, again, is not something desired by the Vatican whose diplomatic relations with America were cemented only recently. Moreover, throughout history the Jew has made a very useful scion and lieutenant. His survival depends upon his secret fealty to the Cross and/or Crown. This is the case for the Rothschilds (Knights of Malta and keepers of the Vatican's treasury), and many other plutocratic Hofjuden (Court Jews).  <br>  <br>_The Rothschilds were Jesuits who used their Jewish background as a facade to cover their sinister activities. The Jesuits, working through Rothschild and Biddle, sought to gain control of the banking system of the United States_ - Bill Hughes (_The Secret Terrorists_)  <br>  <br>_Aware that the Rothschilds are an important Jewish family, I looked them up in Encyclopedia Judaica and discovered that they bear the title “Guardians of the Vatican Treasury”…The appointment of Rothschild gave the black papacy absolute financial power and secrecy. Who would ever search a family of orthodox Jews for the key to the wealth of the Roman Catholic Church?_ - F. T. Saussy (_Rulers of Evil_)  <br>  <br>In other words, the world conspiracy was not devised and designed by Jews. Although Jews have no allegiance with any Gentile nation, and have been used as chess pieces in most Gentile plots for world domination, they have never risen above the power of the Atonist-Masonic "Black Lodge" or "Black Nobility." This elite group includes families within the College of Cardinals, who artfully promote and reward Jews (and others) for acting as scapegoats and fall-guys when and if the need arises, and being in history's headlines as the foremost political malefactors. Along with their close ally, British Intelligence, the Red Papacy are the architects of the never ending Israel-Palestine conflict. This conflict, like so many others in history, is funded by the world's wealthiest men, the world's wealthiest Socialists and Islamo-Communists, the world's deadliest present threat.  <br>  <br><br>- See my article [Jews and Templars: The Untold Story](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html)_[,](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html)_ for more on the Jewish role in world conspiracy.||

Of course the non-Marxist branch of the Vatican are not as concerned about the rise of Zionism, and have even used Israel as a tool to undermine their rivals among the neo-Marxist Papists. This accounts for the various pro-Zionist, pro-Israel movements and voices in both Protestant and Catholic churches. Baron Manhattan warned of the powerful combine forming between right-wing Catholics and Zionists. He suspected that it was partly because of this alliance that the Eastern bloc declined and fractured, already weakened by the policies and activities of the left-wing Red Papacy. Again, knowing about these two opposing factions within the Vatican - the right-wing and left-wing - helps us make sense of the comments and views of most front-page politicians and clerics. It helps us understand behind-the-scenes machinations happening in our times.

|---|There's one born every second. However, the question remains, to whom do we turn to learn the truth about the Jewish role in world affairs? Are we told the truth by the media about the Jewish-Palestinian conflict? Is the Red Papacy bound to condemn Zionism and the Israelis because the latter are ardent Capitalists rather than Islamo-Communists? What happens if the media deceives us about the alleged crimes of Jews against Moslems, and what if we've been expertly hoodwinked about the Jewish role in world conspiracy? Can extremist Christians be trusted on this or any other subject? Do Christians condemn Jews because they have secret alliances with rich Arabs? Do some Christians praise Jews so that the latter won't reveal the perfidy and chicanery of Christians? Do left-wing Jews really deserve to be respected as true Jews or have they been using Judaism as a cover and means to an end? Do occult Jews wish to destroy both Judaism and Christianity? Were Zionist-Jews finally gifted Israel as a long awaited reward for services rendered as Hofjuden or Court Jews? Are the Rothschilds, Oppenheimers, Warburgs, Schiffs, etc, really "Jews?" Has some unseen order infiltrated both left- and right-wing Jewish contingents, pitting one side against the other for their own sinister purposes? ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html) for more...)  <br>  <br><br>- ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_socialism) and [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenism) for more on subversive Christian groups)|---|

Right-wing Catholics and Zionists are not able to work together permanently because of their theological differences. They may be antagonistic toward the same left-wing groups, but when it comes to religion, they are miles apart. The religious Zionist wants to win the world for Jehovah, while the Catholic wants to win it for Jesus. Of course, the Muslim wants to win the world for Allah. This is why alliances between these groups are doomed from the start, and can only be short-lived. Nothing will change until religion is itself rejected by each and every faction and cabal, and that is a day that will never come. As we see from history, the most dynamic and effective political leaders thrown up by Zionism and Papism tend to be the most theocratically zealous. To overcome this persistent problem and impasse, the Vatican has developed a policy of _ecumenicalism_. This direction is especially promoted by the Shadow-Communists, who long ago realized that religious extremism hinders agreements and alliances not only with Communist countries, but other non-Jewish and non-Christian lands. Ecumenicalism is greeted warmly even by moderate Catholics, since it constitutes a weapon against Protestantism, the traditional enemy.

LEFT: The Pope kisses the Koran. Pope John Paul II, like other popes after him, flew to every corner of the globe, kissing and schmoozing with potentates of the world's religions. Pius XII was probably turning in his grave. No right-wing pope would have sanctioned ecumenicalism of this kind. The message from the Vatican is that "We may have become neo-Marxists, but we did so in the name of Christ. What's more, we aren't theologically exclusive any longer. We are all one big global family." Fabians and Jesuits everywhere climbed onboard delighted.  

The Red Papacy's success is plainly seen in the rise of the United Nations and more recent European Union. The main architects of these multinational bodies were agents of the Vatican-Washington alliance. Instead of the restoration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as envisioned by Pope Pius XII - and instead of worldwide Communism as envisioned by hardliner Bolsheviks - we got the United States of Europe and a Euro-Communism a la Red Papacy.

||Yes, it's a massive job running a country the size of America. It's even more difficult running the world. The colossal problem was soon solved by the creation of massive bureaucratic organizations such as the United Nations. As its twelve-starred emblem reveals, this leviathan and its commissars serve to implement the policies of the Red Papacy.  <br>  <br>The multinational orgs that grew out of the Bretton Woods Agreement and Maastricht, Lisbon and Rome Treaties, were the brainchildren of Red Papists and their Jewish and Gentile agents. The existence and global policies of these orgs ensures that the overarching theological and political agendas of the Red Papacy cannot be contradicted and overturned by any other group. The shadowy commissioners behind the EU are almost exclusively Red Papists, with little love for Capitalism and the west. The Red Papacy learned how to manipulate and use multinational organizations for their own benefit after 1920, when the League of Nations was established. At first the Vatican was opposed to the organization, but when numerous Latin American countries flocked to join the League, and for the first time enjoyed political clout to change the course of world affairs, the Vatican had no choice but to change its spots and align with the League. From then on the Vatican, as well as the Jesuits, have made excellent use of the United Nations organization which succeeded the League of Nations. The various disposable politicians leading the Latin American countries, voting for this and that policy at the United Nations and other globalist leviathans, are merely glove-puppets controlled by unseen Red Papists whose diplomatic power has been vastly increased by way of intergovernmental organizations of this kind. The so-called "New World Order" agenda would not have taken hold as an idea or a reality without this largely secretive but highly efficient alliance between the Red Papacy, League of Nations, United Nations and EU. By way of this enhancement of power the Shadow-Communists were finally able to insinuate their agents into the corridors of power in America, Britain and other countries throughout Europe and the world.||

|---|The Red Papacy exercises considerable power through orgs such as the Council on Foreign Relations. It has agents within numerous secret societies, such as Opus Dei, Knights of St. Patrick, Knights of Columbus, Skull and Bones Society and Bohemian Club, etc. Members and agents of these societies and orgs control the banks and corporate world, not to mention the many non-profit foundations and so-called "philanthropic" associations. Red Papacy agents in government contrive these bizarre political liaisons between this or that head of state. It's all made for TV. Men who attempted to expose how secret societies work to subvert national sovereignty and direct national and global policies - such as Anthony Sutton, John Coleman, and others - have been forcibly silenced and ridiculed.|---|

|---|The crucial point to grasp - which so many ignore and resist - is that the papacy's version of Socialism long _predates_ the rise of Marxism and Bolshevism. The latter were, accordingly, considered impostures and obstacle by Red Papists determined to overthrow them and re-situate the capital of World Revolution (World Socialism) in Rome. No need for clumsy demagoguery, thuggery, brutish violence, megadeath and jackboots on faces. The new kind of Vatican-funded Progressivism welcomes the world in with smiles and more smiles. God is in his heaven, and all will soon be right with the world. After 1920, the Red Papacy negotiated with the hardline Soviets, welcoming them onboard, saying that _their_ hardline version of Communism was turning people off rather than on to Socialism. Many leaders of the Communist Party - particularly Mikhail Gorbachev and Vladimir Putin - finally agreed that this is indeed sound, and that a new way is needed to rule the world.|---|

In America, as said, the many opportunist politicians and presidents are not elected by the public, but selected by the Red Papists. From their headquarters at Boston College and Georgetown University they direct those who appear to direct national and international affairs. They control the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Federal Reserve, US Supreme Court, and most other important and prestigious centers of learning, politics and business.

||Recent presidents of the United States have been ardently left-wing. This is because they are selected by the Red Papists. Thanks to its many advocates and stooges, Shadow-Communism a la Red Papacy moves full steam ahead. The Capitalist west is thoroughly crippled, and the final humiliation is soon to come, when the Far East sends its money and industry to prop-up a bankrupt America. The patriarchs of the Red Papacy have expertly eviscerated America on many levels, and via their Hofjuden agents in the Federal Reserve, they have succeeded in emptying America's coffers, dispossessing the people who have no idea what is happening, expertly distracted by never ending media spectacles and petty faux rivalries. Had America supported Germany against Britain during the First and Second World Wars, it would have been so inherently strong in the post-war years that the Red Papacy and its agents would never have been able to insinuate themselves, as they had done in South America, and would never have been in a position to subvert the country before it had time to develop beyond its infancy period.  <br>  <br>_…former Senator Danforth threatened the recalcitrant FBI director Louis Freeh with a search warrant. It is a pity that he did not get one. He might, in the process, have discovered a bit more about Freeh’s membership in Opus Dei (meaning God’s Work), a secretive international Roman Catholic order dedicated to getting its membership into high political, corporate, and religious offices…in various lands to various ends…Media-light was cast on the order when it was discovered that Robert Hanssen, an FBI agent, had been a Russian spy for twenty-two years but also that he and his director, Louis Freeh…“not only were both members of the same Roman Catholic church in suburban Virginia but…also belonged to the local chapter of Opus Dei”_ - Gore Vidal (_Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace_)||

|---|LEFT: Financier George Soros. RIGHT: Russian president Vladimir Putin. Both men are Vatican agents. Like Hitler before him, Putin is the latest in a long line of movers and shakers placed in charge of the Red Papacy's policy for world control. His version of Shadow-Communism furthers the Red Papacy's desire for the obliteration of national sovereignty, Capitalism, class and gender division. His agents are behind the conflicts that exist between Islam and the west, and between extremist groups on the left and right. Putin expertly directs faux white supremacists, Muslim terrorists and sinister west-hating Chinese factions in their related schemes to undermine western economies, western security and western morale. Some researchers imagine Putin to be a Zionist stooge. In our mind, he and the billionaire Jews (Sabbateans) surrounding him are all efficient lieutenants of the Red Papacy (and Templars). They answer to Rome which has been since the '80s the new headquarters of Shadow-Communism.|---|

|---|**.**  <br><br>_There exists not, upon the face of the earth, a better organized dictatorship, and which has maintained herself for so many centuries, than the Fascist political state of the Vatican. She has known how to use the name of Christianity astutely, and has willed to represent Christian values thus confusing and deceiving millions_ - Monsignor Rafael Rodriguez Guillen (_Power of the Vatican_)|

The Red Papacy's designs on world control have been well and truly executed and fulfilled. Communism's first phase came and went. It provided a template that was, in the background, carefully and artfully improved and upgraded through the years after the Second World War and fall of Fascism. After the inauguration of Pope John Paul II, there was less need for secrecy, and the Red Papists or Shadow-Communists became all the more brazen and confident. Their agents have been many, and include Tony Blair, Barack Obama, George Soros and Vladimir Putin, not to mention their many astute advisers, modern-day Svengalis like Mandell House, Harold Laski, Franz Neumann, Herbert Marcuse and Leo Pasvolsky of yesteryear.  
  
Room has been made by the victors for other factions and cadres to exist and spar, such as Zionists, Muslim Brotherhood, Christian fundamentalists, Mormons, Anarchists, People's movements, Social Justice Warriors, or what have you. No problem there. One needs a little variety to spice things up, and if needs be to lead attention away from where you don't want it focusing. The clashes between these factions makes a great gladiator's arena spectacle. But despite the appearance of diversity there is barely a bona fide right-wing movement anywhere to be found. The last legitimate cleric to stand up against the Red Papacy was Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre of France. After his death in 1991, there has been little open resistance to the Shadow-Communists of Vatican City. Most recent so-called right-wing movements are of the faux variety. The very term "right-wing" now serves mostly as a diatribe to stigmatize and ostracize any person or group with the temerity to challenge the Red Papacy and its many "progressive" agents.
