|---|Most of the refuters who groundlessly and maliciously attack revisionists are narrow-minded conservative Christians of the fundamentalist variety. They are for the most part feeble cynical fanatics without intelligence. They are desperate to strengthen the weak foundations of their sorry "faith," and believe this is achieved by rabidly contradicting and challenging those few mavericks within the revisionist research community whose discoveries cut at the roots of all they believe. They attempt to find a modicum of psychological stability in a world where literate, informed people day-by-day throw out the irrational superstitions which enslaved their ancestors.  <br>  <br>Because of recent discoveries about the past, and authorship and credibility of the Bible, the age-old lies and "pious frauds" in the Old and New Testaments are now finally seen for what they are. In regards the latter compendium, sane researchers realize that we don't have a single definable "Jesus Christ" a la St. Paul. Rather we have a warmongering Jesus (Judas) Khrestus, a Messianic Jesus of Gamala, a Jesus (Joshua) of the Fish, as well as others fitting the general description of the supposed Son of God. Which one do we pick? Which one was venerated by "Christians" two thousand years ago? Which one was divine and which a human fanatical Messianic rabble-rouser? Which one was a scheming demagogue, which a claimant for the throne of Rome? Which of them was executed by the authorities? Which one was exalted to the status of a demigod by followers after his demise? Which one, if any, was truly a _historical_ person?  <br>  <br>Yes, when we review the few unimpressive passages in the works of some early historians supposedly "proving" the existence of Jesus, we are bound to ask _which_ Jesus is actually being referenced? Why do we continue assuming that there was but one public figure with this name? And since most ancient commenters did not use the name Jesus or anything like it when referring to this elusive icon of Christians, why do we assume him to be the character presented by Saint Paul, himself revealed as none other than mythmonger extraordinaire Josephus Flavius, the commissioned agent of the world's great tyrants ensconced in imperial Rome?  <br>  <br>Why do we settle for loose English translations of these Latin passages that appear to speak of Christianity's Jesus? Why are they not presented first in their original form so we can see what might be lost in translation? Might not words such as "worshiped" simply refer to political rather than divine veneration? Might not the appellations "divine" and "savior" simply refer to the exalted status of earthly rulers? Might not the term "Son of God" have been the title of a caesar or emperor? We now know this to have been the case.|---|

|---|More crucially, why do we accept the claims of a character who - given that he existed according to the accounts of a few interested historians - proclaimed _himself_ divine? Is such a claim verifiable in our times or times past? And did not one ancient monarch and self-appointed Messiah after another proclaim themselves divine? What makes the claims of the Gospel's "Jesus" special? Absolutely _nothing_.|---|

R. S. Mead (_Fragments of a Faith Forgotten_)|---|

||The fanatics who attempt to authenticate the few brief references to Jesus in the work of this or that ancient historian pay no attention to academics of the highest caliber who cast doubt on those same passages. Many of these academics are not Christians and well and truly see Christianity for the fraud it is. However, these same fanatical Christians elsewhere attempt to refute alternative researchers by _citing_ academics and scientists from the same school as those who cast doubt on the authenticity of the Bible and existence of Jesus.  <br>  <br>It is important to bear this sleight-of-hand in mind when dealing with fanatical Christians attempting to set themselves up as critics of alternative research. If a qualified academic disproves the authenticity of passages cited by Christians as proof for the existence of Jesus, how can he, or others of his school, be wheeled out by those same Christians when they seek to bolster criticisms against revisionists? The fanatical Christian is thereby saying that he trusts and favors science only when it serves his cause, not when it undermines it. By this contradictory tactic he openly reveals himself for the scurrilous fraud he is.  <br>  <br>Regrettably, despite the revelations of recent times, the machinery of lies, deceit and denial grinds on unabated. None of these facts have phased most believers. This is because the average Christian fanatic is the victim of egomania and monomania. He presumes himself the champion of mainstream religion and tradition. He conforms and abases his will before his heavenly tyrant. As a result he sets himself the task of forcing others to do likewise. It's a job he relishes. He is unwilling to leave people to intellectually progress on their own. If people refuse to do as he says, preferring to individuate and think for themselves, he sets himself up as Inquisitor General, in order to demand conformity to the status quo. His zealousness is not less than that of history's sadistic inquisitors who reduced their ideological enemies to ashes on fiery stakes throughout Christendom.  <br>  <br>Christianity as we know it has been in state of turmoil for decades, and is currently on its last legs. Rational humans have little time for its antihuman doctrines and preposterous supernatural god. They are aware of how much crime has been perpetrated in the name of Jehovah. They are also becoming aware of the innumerable frauds perpetrated by the ministers of religion to maintain their status quo. They are learning how religious doctrines espoused by Christians warp our vision of the world have served to demean women, animals and non-believers for over two thousand years. They've heard numerous priests and pastors openly declare that they no longer believe in God.  <br>  <br>Fanatical Christians don't join in and graciously advise. They don't decently and respectfully suggest changes or compliment work well done. No, they prefer to act like school yard bullies, and get their kicks by picking on the smallest, weakest child. The bully tears open the vulnerable boy's satchel and browbeats him for not having his books and papers in the desired order. Of course that order is determined by the bully and is not an order that needs to be imposed, and not one to which even the bully conforms when all is said and done. The ransacking bully is insecure about himself, and finds temporary gratification by forcing other people to come up to scratch. He poses as a "father figure" because he himself is emotionally and mentally infantile. His behavior is petty but compensatory. By pointing out the supposed deficits of others more vulnerable than himself he imagines himself superior. If even one other person bows to his superiority, he is puffed up no end.  <br>  <br>Demographically, alternative researchers constitute an extremely small group within the greater population of the world. Their influence is negligible. They are part of a fringe movement that began barely twenty years ago. The movement is in an adolescent stage of development and has a long way to go before the masses of the world turn to it with anything other than contempt. This means that the average revisionist is full of passion but open to making some mistakes and misjudgments. However this vulnerability testifies to the _strengths_ rather than weakness of the revisionist's mind. It is a perfectly natural condition given the nascence of the revolutionary enterprises underway.  <br>  <br>Revisionists are also open to manipulation. Indeed their community will not be the first to be exploited by cunning carpet-baggers and provocateurs out for their own gain. Alternative researchers are not immune to being deceived and misguided. However they can grow and take care of their own house without the intervention of deeply threatened Christian fanatics eager to undermine the enterprise before it is able to gather strength and popularity. As they develop understanding, the alternative researcher will develop the ability to discern between the true and the false. He should be allowed to develop the skill without interference from those with more than enough to deal with sorting out their own messes. In our opinion the fanatic tirades against the alternative scholar exist because it distracts him from dealing with the colossal decay bringing down his own house.  <br>  <br>Although most Christian fanatics steer clear of alternative researchers, some of the sickest choose to ransack their work, attempting to undermine it before it has a chance to mature. Whereas Christianity has had thousands of years to establish and promote itself, the alternative community has had but a few years to do so. However even in its early stages of development it has served to damage the foundations of orthodox religion. This unsettles many who have unreservedly accepted the preposterous nonsense of the Bible and other religious works.  <br>  <br>We remind our readers that it is not only from alternative circles that devastating attacks against religious belief have come. The Christian fanatic's worldview has been shaken to the core by the findings of the Dead Sea Scrolls scholars and members of the Jesus Seminar. The discoveries of eminent scholars, such as Bart Ehrman and Professor Thompson, wreck accepted precepts and doctrines. Their all-important Jesus figure has been turned into a ever-melting snowman. Their St. Paul has been uncovered as an agent of imperialist Roman patrician families hell-bent on maintaining world control. Their dignitaries, patriarchs and church fathers are now for the most part regarded by informed people as little more than psychotics and sado-masochists. This holds true whether we speak of the Roman Catholic or Protestant branches of Christianity.  <br>  <br>In light of this it is not surprising to find the more threatened and challenged Christian fanatic preferring to find whipping-boys among the newly founded alternative research community. It gives them something to soothe their inner ache and preoccupy them now that their own houses are swiftly burning to the ground, never to be rebuilt.  <br>  <br>It is the purpose of this article to lay out some vital facts to be borne in mind when dealing with cynical, self-important fanatics of this kind. These include the following:||

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||> Christians are not to consider themselves the sole enemies of evil. In fact Christians are latecomers to the great fight. They are a welcome contingent as long as they realize that their tent is but one of many on the field of battle. Fanatical Christians arrogantly wish to see themselves as the only champions opposing evil. Such is not the case. Not by a long chalk. Evil has haunted our world long before the advent of Christianity, and has been opposed by many great forgotten heroes who fell in the name of Truth long before the birth of Jesus.  <br>>   <br>> Fanatical Christians have no right to misuse science. Over the years science has proven that there was no Jesus Christ as presented by St. Paul and the Gospel writers. Revelations about the inauthenticity of numerous scriptures and tracts within them have shaken the religion to its foundations. Yet bizarrely, in order to bolster their insidious attacks against revisionists, fanatical Christians often turn to science for support. This they cannot do without compromising their own weak position. The more they call on science to support them, the more their own position is threatened. When we understand this duplicity we are no longer threatened by the attempts of religious fanatics to undermine the discoveries of revisionists.  <br>>   <br>> Judeo-Christianity is the concoction of megalomaniacs. Their scriptures are for the most part the biography of the world's most perfidious crime-families and the duplicitous agents in their employ. The evidence for this is no longer a well-kept secret. The god of these families and their conformist followers is himself an archon set up in ancient times as an object of worship by extreme psychopaths. Jehovah is not the god of wise mystics and sages whose message of love and humanity would long ago have saved humankind, had it been permitted to flourish. The wisdom of the ancient sages was challenged and suppressed by the same kind of fanatics who, as a new breed of inquisitors, now wish to stamp out the alternative research community.  <br>>   <br>> The Christian fanatic is unimaginative and uncreative. The cogs of his medieval consciousness have ground to a halt because of his unwavering irrational "faith" in absurd superstitions. His type has created nothing of value for centuries. Some might say his type’s influence has been wholly destructive and exploitatory. Small wonder therefore that he is threatened by his nemesis, the revisionist. Not only does revisionism constitute a relatively new intellectual movement, but revisionists themselves are for the most part exceptionally creative people. Indeed they are in their own right pioneers who have opened many new doors for humanity to walk through. They invent and create new devices as well as new ways of seeing, and have founded new subjects to research. Moreover, their pioneering work has shaken the moribund foundations of religion and science, providing us with fresh and powerful insights not only into these areas but into the hitherto unseen architecture of world and mind control. Although there have been some open-minded Christian researchers whose work inspired later non-Christian mavericks, the Christian revisionist’s intellectual exertions are inevitably seriously hampered by outmoded beliefs and deeply impoverished philosophical outlooks. He, like his even less-endowed narrow-minded cousin, is unwilling to see that Judeo-Christianity as a religion and mindset was established by the very evilarchy he wrongheadedly seeks to oppose. When all is said and done, the non-believing revisionist is by far the more eligible and successful researcher. His insight into dark matters is more likely to be unencumbered and penetrating. As a result his discoveries and revelations competently change humanity for the better.  <br>>   <br>> Christian fanatics, like Christians in general, have their work cut out for them tending to their own house which is in ruins. In light of this, we do well to keep up to speed with the new discoveries that compromise Christian theology. We do well to remember how fanatical and unsettled Christians are, given that they are aware of how their beliefs are intellectually and philosophically bankrupt.  <br>>   <br>> Christian fanatics should refrain from bullying tactics toward alternative researchers. A few minor victories over this small vulnerable group will not stop open-minded people respecting their work and learning grand truths about history and religion, devastating to corrupt mainstream institutions. If changes need to be made, they can be suggested in a decent respectful manner, the way truly _good_ Christians are wont to interact with others in the world.  <br>>   <br>> The alternative researcher is, like a forensic detective, working with sparse evidence. He knows his work is made more difficult because of the universal suppression of evidence and wholesale pillage of ancient civilizations. Given that a great deal of this criminality was committed in the name of religion, it is ridiculous for maverick historians and researchers to maintain a high opinion of religion. Indeed it is more likely that they become ardent critics of religion. Doing so inevitably makes them targets for the fanatic who fears the ruin of all he believes and trusts. The alternative researcher is passionately motivated by the search for truth, whereas the fanatic's motivations are fear and hate. As the testimony of history reveals, in the past the fanatic martyred the free-thinker.  <br>>   <br>> The Christian fanatic ruthlessly penalizes certain revisionists for speculating on the past. They do so knowing that evidence for what happened in the ancient past is scant. They do so knowing that whole nations were destroyed and that cashes of texts were committed to the flames numerous times throughout history. Despite this fact, the fanatic does not pull his punches or give quarter. Whereas his community has enjoyed thousands of years to establish "credibility," alternative researchers have, relatively speaking, had minutes. They are also forced to make do with the dearth of information to bolster their ideas. As a result, they are bound to speculate and ponder. They ask questions, some important and some not so important. But the uninvited fanatic unsympathetically hovers helicopter-like over the revisionist's head like some frustrated sadistic schoolmaster demeaning every well-meaning thought and speculation. He considers knowledge to be a lamp-post on which he can, like a dog, urinate to mark territory. The free-thinker reminds him that nothing of the sort is the case. Ideas are for everyone, regardless of background and level of intelligence. Knowledge is not territory over which one man or group has dominion.  <br>>   <br>> Unsympathetically criticizing the few mistakes and misjudgments of thinkers within the alternative research community will not deter the truth from getting out to the masses of the world. Although the former school has only recently begun its important work, its existence and work constitutes a new zeitgeist that cannot be permanently hindered. Historically speaking we are now in the best age to uncover the architecture of control and lies that kept our forebears in a state of ignorance and servitude.  <br>>   <br>> The mistakes and misjudgments sometimes found in alternative research are nothing compared to the intentionally created lies and disinformation conspicuous in academic circles. Strangely but suggestively, the Christian fanatic cares less about this welter of deceptiveness. He is not motivated to rebel against it. He is, however, much more likely to attack the vulnerable alternative researcher. This is because, as explained above, he is basically a bully. He will not directly take on heavyweights who expose the deceptions perpetrated through the centuries by religious zealots. To do so serves to inevitably expose the secretive collusion that exists between the high level ministers of religion and science who share the aim of suppressing free-thought and individualism. The scientist is a materialist and collectivist selling a utopian future. The cleric is a witchdoctor promising a paradise in the life hereafter. Both parties represent and promulgate doctrines which bring about the emotional and intellectual ruin of humankind.  <br>>   <br>> The discoveries of alternative inventors are also ridiculed and blocked. Free-energy devices and other technological marvels which put power back into the hands of ordinary people constitute a major threat the world's power-brokers. We are to make do with the science handed down and taught to us in official institutions. We are forbidden to think for ourselves and research the work of mavericks in both science and religion. Let us bear in mind that there has been no greater barrier to scientific thought, of every kind, than religion. No Christian fanatic has taken up the cause of the alternative inventor who works to help make the world a better and freer place.  <br>>   <br>> The Christian fanatic as well as the common-or-garden scientist refutes theories that speak of alien visitation. This is a key area of interest for some alternative researchers involved in the early stages of investigation into this fascinating subject. The former prefer we believe in the interference of _spiritual_ beings such as Satan and so-called Fallen Angels, and does not want us to consider them to be of _extraterrestrial_ (physical) origin, despite the evidence for this. The average scientist is on paper more likely to agree with revisionists who advocate the non-supernatural origin of Satan and the Fallen Angels. But we find that this is often not the case. This is not surprising to the informed alternative researcher, who knows how indoctrinated and biased the average scientist is when it comes to anything that threatens their limited worldview. The work of researchers such as John Allegro, Immanuel Velikovsky, Barry Fell, Comyns Beaumont, Richard Milton, Allen and Delair, Michael Cremo, and others, serves to demolish the chicanery and "sacred" theories about history as promulgated by the vast majority of conformist mainstream academics. In short, the average scientist's worldview is compromised as much as that of the average closed-minded critic of alternative research. It is therefore condemned from all sides. In this regard the Christian fanatic has no problem with the scientist who scoffs at the concept of extraterrestrial visitation. They can take turns throwing mud at revisionists.  <br>>   <br>> Fanatical Christians don't know what an "opinion" is. It's not a word or concept they've encountered. If a revisionist says that there appear to be flying craft in a few medieval paintings, the fanatic hears him say that flying craft "are" there in the paintings. If a revisionist says that flying craft appear to have been added by an ancient artist in a canvas depicting Mary the Madonna, the fanatic hears him say that flying craft are there without doubt. Sane people know what opinions are and what healthy speculation is. They don't have minds permanently cased in cement. Additionally, it is conceivable that an ancient artist may well have subliminally suggested to his audience something which he never intended them to consciously consider. This happens as a norm in many genres of Western art. In fact, it is what art is all about. Nothing in art is actually _real._ It is all a depiction. However, some art - particularly great art - works on deep levels, as great artists know and intend it should. And subtextual communication is the forte of competent artists. Art historians of caliber know that many images taken one way by the mass of casual viewers actually convey secret information never discerned by the majority. In this sense it is quite possible that a medieval artist craftily painted what most viewers take to be a star or planet, _intending_ that initiated viewers "make the connection." It therefore matters little that a person from the first class of viewers cynically negates the perspective of people from the second class. It's an exercise in futility. The fanatic must prove that it was _not_ the artist's intention to be benignly deceptive and subtly suggestive. He must find a signed document in which the artist states "I have not added anything in this painting of a subliminal nature...and a star is just a star." This is of course preposterous, as is the argument and intention of the fanatic.  <br>>   <br>> Moreover, we ask the fanatic to explain how mankind ever began looking _upward_ to objects in the sky, to connect them with angels, gods and spiritual omens? How did the luminaries become objects of spiritual interest? Why is the sky considered the domicile of God? Of course the fanatic is hesitant to engage in this conversation. He knows where it leads. He does not want us to speak of Astro-Theology and occult subjects that help us to correctly decipher the very Bible he foolishly takes literally. He does not want us to remind him that when ancient man looked up into "heaven" it was to the stars _themselves._ And from this ancient astronomical religion all other theologies took birth, not least Christianity which is entirely _sidereal_ in origin and nature. The fanatic does not want to consider that ancient extraterrestrials, after appearing in the heavens and descending to earth, taught astronomy and astro-mythology to humankind. In short, even if actual extraterrestrial crafts are not shown in some of the medieval art studied by revisionists, the phenomenon of "looking up" _is_ certainly depicted. And that apparently innocuous activity may itself be the strongest practical proof of all concerning humankind's extraterrestrial origins.  <br>>   <br>> Those fanatics who doubt that the Great Pyramid was created by way of extraterrestrial technology, stress that humans alone moved the blocks used in its construction. Although this may indeed have been the case, the theory in no way compromises the ideas put forth by the few researchers who prefer to believe in extraterrestrial involvement. Even if sledges and appropriate tools for cutting huge hard stones existed, it does not contradict the case for extraterrestrial influence. Not in the least. At most it might only contradict theories for extraterrestrial involvement put forward by inept and inarticulate proponents of the theory. No doubt there are such people in the field of alternative research. In any case, the fanatical refuter is careful to avoid reference to the startling _geometry_ employed in the building of the Pyramid and other marvelous structures throughout the world. He does this because to do so will cause open-minded people to question Christian accounts for history and the duration of the creation. After all, Christians believed (and many still believe) that the creation is little more than four thousand years old. Therefore they are disturbed by any theory that speaks of ancient man's high technological expertize. They are compromised by the existence of the pyramids and other structures which can only be explained when we accept the technical sophistication of our forebears, regardless of whether extraterrestrials were involved or not.  <br>>   <br>> Extraterrestrial theory threatens most Christians because it inevitably leads to conclusions that compromise their favored cosmogony. After all, if visiting extraterrestrials enslaved humanity, might they not have invented the "gods" in whose name the human race has long been enslaved? Although Christian holy books do not speak of this predicament, they are certainly not to be considered manifestos of freedom. On the contrary, they are better suited as manuals for enslavers. Religion is demonstrably against reason and technological advancement whether it be on this planet or anywhere in the universe.   <br>>   <br>> On the other hand, if the visiting extraterrestrials were goodly liberators, bestowing man with the tools for physical and intellectual independence and sovereignty, the Christian must confess that their precious legacy was sabotaged and undermined by their own Church which openly objects to the theory of extraterrestrial involvement, as it secretly objects to reason and scientific advancement. Churchmen prefer to believe in the _supernatural_ involvement of angelic beings because the idea of extraterrestrial involvement contradicts their age-old belief in supernatural realms. The metaphysical premise for their theology is compromised by this more logical theory. Moreover, to believe in benign extraterrestrial involvement supposes that one day in the future such beings may return to our planet to overturn the thrones of humanity's enslavers. This upsets the average Christian who waits for the return of Jesus.  <br>>   <br>> The fanatic not only irrationally derides the idea of extraterrestrial visitation but also denies accounts that speak of ancient technology and atomic war. Despite the evidence, the skeptical fanatic points out the spuriousness of one or two texts which speak of the phenomenon. Of course it never occurs to the skeptic that these documents may simply reiterate _earlier_ legitimate scripts and texts now lost to us. The fanatic never concedes the self-evident fact that thousands of ancient documents have been deliberately destroyed by agents of his own religion. More importantly, his inept work of cynical contradiction does not help account for the numerous Biblical passages that hint of atomic conflagrations in ancient times. There are many passages from the books of Joshua, Deuteronomy, Job, Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Revelation, and so on, that can be explained once we accept the concept of ancient technology and atomic war. Open-minded Christians have no problem with this concept. However, closed-minded Christians explain it by referring to supernatural agencies or God's own wrath. They don't realize that by drawing attention to the monstrous acts of their sadistic god, they compel sane people to _prefer_ the concept of extraterrestrial involvement. Anything to spare humanity from the maniacal god portrayed in the Bible.  <br>>   <br>> Christian fanatics also make a point of refuting ancient accounts of space flight and flying machines. They point out that certain texts which speak of the phenomenon are of spurious origin. However, on close inspection we find that their arguments against the existence of ancient flying crafts are not sound. This is because their main argument states that when crafts are presently manufactured according to designs found in allegedly ancient books such as Vaimanika Shastra, they fail to fly. Therefore the existence of ancient flying machines (Vimana) is deemed unacceptable. However, this is shaky since the criticism is aimed at the legitimacy of pictures and text in a book, and has no necessary relevance to the actuality of ancient flying craft. Even if every ancient text on the subject turns out to be false or wrong, the actuality of ancient flying machines remains uncontested and possible. Although the world is flooded with fake Faberge eggs, it does not mean that Faberge and his authentic eggs did not once exist. And if bad photos and explanations are all we have to tell us about original eggs, it also does not mean that originals did not actually exist before those inadequate records came into existence.  <br>>   <br>> A few inadequate texts are one thing, the oral tradition hoary with age is another. Only a fragment of what we know about humankind's history has ever been committed to writing, and much of that archive is lost due to Christian fanaticism. Nevertheless, what we find in written form is vastly outweighed by what is preserved in oral traditions - the myths and legends - of the world's many cultures. And for some alternative researchers, this oral tradition is to be taken as an important repository of fact. Mainstream historians have done their best to relegate folk traditions and myths and legends to a Mythological Cycle, hoping it will be dismissed and ignored. And for the most part their device has worked to that end. However, a few within the alternative research community have broken the consensus and dipped back into the ancient archive to tease out information that challenges much of what we commonly believe about ancient times. The myths and legends constitute a living tradition and archive of wisdom which we dismiss at our own peril. It's a tradition that was not invented by academics with degrees or by self-serving journalists and carpet-baggers. It is one of the most sacred repositories we know. As Joseph Campbell and others stressed, we turn to it and find out who we as moderns are, on all levels. It contains wisdom that no amount of clerics and academics are capable of transmitting to the human race. Moreover, by taking a serious interest in the world's intriguing myths and legends, we soon discover the reason for their relegation. We come upon the presence of the insidious unseen but corporeal hands that rule our world, the sinister presence rarely if ever addressed by Christians who prefer to believe in evil spirits and ghosts than all too physical tyrants in high places working overtime to disempower humanity. Let us always remember that the most perfidious architects and agents of control plaguing the world exercise their considerable power from behind the cross as well as the crown.||
