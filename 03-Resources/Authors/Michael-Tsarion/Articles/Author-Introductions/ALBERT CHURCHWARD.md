|---|_Wherever the Solar Cult people traveled they tried to destroy all previous Cults, and if they could not obliterate these entirely, they imposed as much as possible of their own, and absorbed previous phases into their own_ - Albert Churchward|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|**Overview**  <br>Albert Churchward (1852-1925) was the younger brother of the great scholar of prehistory James Churchward, who established the plausible existence of the ancient civilization of Lemuria. Taking his lead from Gerald Massey, Albert made a critical in-depth study of the beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. By deciphering their strange complicated symbolism and rites, he set about exposing the true roots of Judaism and Christianity. His particular interest and study was the history and influence of the great cults of antiquity, particularly the Stellar, Lunar and Solar. Among Churchward's monumentally important works are the following:  <br>  <br><br>- _Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man_<br>- _The Origin and Evolution of the Human Race_<br>- _The Origin and Evolution of Religion_<br>- _The Origin and Evolution of Freemasonry_<br>- _Freemasonry and its Egyptian Influence_<br>- _The Arcana of Freemasonry_<br><br>  <br>Throughout these extraordinary books Churchward deftly shows how later edifices of religion plagiarized and cannibalized key elements from the cults of antiquity. Seminal leitmotifs from their antique mythos were appropriated and rescripted by Jewish and Christian mythmongers. It was a process that not only involved wholesale desecration, but centuries of text confiscation and destruction by burning.|---|

|---|**Jewish Mythmongers**  <br>Modern research sees in ancient Hebrew literature nothing but a succession of editorial scribes, including Ezra and Nehemiah, who exercised free discretion in correcting, interpolating, and transposing the contents contents of ancient Egyptian records which they could not understand, and in even canonizing the recent compositions of anonymous authors in  the  name  of ancient prophets.  <br>  <br>Modern research discovers in the Hebrew writings a composite work, not as the autogram of the Hebrew legislator, but as the editorial patchwork of mingling Semitic legends with cosmopolitan myths, which were copied from the Egyptians, either directly or indirectly, **but without  the  gnosis**.  <br>  <br>**Older than Osiris**  <br>The first phase of the Solar Cult was that of Tem and Tum brought on from the Stellar and Lunar Cults under the name of Atum-Iu as the  child (Tem) and Atum-Ra as the father (Tum); it was far older than the  Osirian Cult,which might be termed a continuation of it under different names.  <br>  <br>**Word Made Flesh**  <br>At first, child Horus was the word made flesh as  Logos of  the  mother, who in this Cult was Hathor-Iusas in relation to Tum or Atum-Ra. Next he was the word made _truth as sayer_ of the father and teacher of the greater mysteries.  <br>  <br>**Lord of All**  <br>Tum,  in  the  _Ritual_,  is   pre-eminently "the  lord." In one Chapter (79) he is addressed as "the lord of heaven," "the lord of life," "the lord of all creatures," "the lord of all." Thus the _Ritual_ contains "the sayings of the Lord."  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The tern "Ritual" refers the pyramid texts and Book of the Dead. The Ritual names Tum (or Atum) as the first and foremost god. Horus is his son, the "sayer" or "speaker" of the Lord's message. Horus is also named Iu or Io, after his mother Hathor-Iusa. He is the original Logia or bringer of the Logos - Mtsar<br><br>  <br>Atum, who comes as the one god in the form of man, is hailed in the Ritual as the lord of heaven, who "issues forth from the earth and createth whatever is begotten," and "who giveth vigour to the men  now  living."  <br>  <br>**The Suffering Savior**  <br>The original legend of the suffering and descent of the Great Spirit on earth  in  the  form  of a man was during the Stellar Cult.  <br>  <br>**Neith**  <br>At first in the Stellar Cult all his powers and attributes were represented in zootype forms and mythologically depicted as the son of the virgin Neith. It was in  the earliest history of man that the great God came and gave his  "Logos"  to man.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The original virgin mother was the Egyptian Neith, reprised in the forms of Athena, Anat, Tanith and Isis, etc - Mtsar<br><br>  <br>**The Four Apostles**  <br>Har-Ur was one of the earliest names given to the great God: he who came on earth "in the form of a man" to give the message to his people forguidancefor future generations. It is said in the Ritual that he instructed his brothers (four brothers or disciples) up to the  regions of  the primary  Mystery, the Mystery within  the veil, the veil that was rent in death which is before all Mysteries, because it is the Mystery of the One Eternal God and the son who issues from the father in his likeness, which two were one.  <br>  <br>**Ra**  <br>After the advent of the Solar Cult, the deities from previous cults were appropriated and incorporated into the pantheon. At this time the syllable Ra was added to their names, as in the case of Sobek-Ra, Atum-Ra and Amen-Ra, etc - Mtsar  <br>  <br>Amen is another name for Atum - Mtsar  <br>  <br>In the hymns to Amen-Ra be is adored as one and the same as Atum, which shows that Amen is a later name for Atum; and he is represented as "the bidden god" of Amenta, or "the secret earth."  <br>  <br>Amen is the one god who is always depicted in the human form and who enters Amenta in the shape of a man for the overthrow of Apap the monster and all the powers  of evil.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: After a cult took power, the god of previous times were often reassigned. Their names were altered and their roles changed slightly. A god of the overworld might be recast as a god of the underworld. A lunar deity may be recast as a solar deity. In fact, as Churchward shows, many of the gods of later times were originally Stellar deities, and were transmogrified in one way of another over time. Indeed, some gods, such as Ptah and Osiris, can die and be reborn as their own sons.<br><br>  <br>Amen (or Atum-Iu or  Atum-Ra or Atum-Hui) was the only deity in all Egypt who was expressly worshiped by the title of "Ankhu," or the ever-living one eternal God.|---|

|---|Tum of Heliopolis, one of the earliest Egyptian creator gods, always representing in human form. He is identical to the later Atum-Ra, the "Self-Produced" or Immaculate One. All created beings emerge from his great eye (the Pole Star). To the Stellar Cult he was a god associated with the pole or central earth axis. There were seven great stations of the pole, seven pole stars, and seven primordial deities associated with them. The original seven sacred nomes along the Nile were styled on these heavenly "cities." They were terrestrial parts of _her_ great celestial body. The imagery and traditions of the Stellar Cult were appropriated by the later Solar Cult.|---|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|**Ptah**  <br>Ptah was in one phase the _father_ of Amen  or Atum-Ra.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Ptah was the patron of the temples and priests of Memphis, which was far older than the solar cult center of An or Heliopolis. I show elsewhere that Ptah was the great icon of the so-called Little People. Being older than Amen or Atum refers to the elder _race_, not individual deity. It is possible that Churchward's antique Stellar Cult was in fact that of the Little People, the world's first astronomers and cyclopean architects. ([Here](http://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/l-a-waddell.html) for more...)<br><br>  <br>Ptah is represented in the form of a pygmy, and his Ari are seven little pygmies, the Egyptians having taken the type from  the  primordial  or first human evolved from the anthropoid ape in Africa - AC  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The circumpolar grove or garden of everlasting stars was created by Ptah and his helpers, the Ari or Aleim (Elohim), for Atum, his son (Adam, the "heavenly man.") Another appellation for Ptah is Put or Patah, Pitar or Pater, as in "father." He was the antetype for Rome;s supreme deity _Jupiter_.<br><br>  <br>**The Great Cults**  <br>As each Cult succeeded the previous one, the first object would be to destroy, as far as possible, all traces of the former, or at least all that could not be brought on or amalgamated into the new  cult.  <br>  <br>**Stellar Cult**  <br>The Stellar Cult existed for at least three hundred thousand years, as witnessed by records found and still extant...The remains and ruins of the large cities and Temples found throughout the world were mostly built by these people.  <br>  <br>They worked out all the revolutions of the Sun, Moon and Stars, and the Ritual of Ancient Egypt upon which all doctrines throughout the world have been founded.  <br>  <br>The old Stellar Cult was followed by the Lunar and then the Solar.  <br>  <br>It was during  the  Stellar Cult  that we have the first record of the Great Spirit descending to communicate directly with man.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: And in the guise of a world-savior he was sent not by God but by the heavenly mother, whose region in the northern sky was Aaru, the original stellar paradise. He was one of her seven children. The Jews and Christians (members of the Solar Cult) appropriated the motifs and recast the goddess as the male "father in heaven." ([Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OE2TI6/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i4) for more...)<br><br>  <br>There was no "father God" until the Solar Cult came into existence, when they evolved a higher concept of the Great  Spirit.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Churchward shows how long a time each cult lasted before being supplanted. Up to 20,000 years would one cult prevail before declining.<br><br>  <br>The Mysteries were a dramatic mode of communicating the secrets of primitive knowledge in Sign Language when this had been extended to the Astronomical Mythology, and the Egyptian _Urshi_ or Astronomers were known by the title "Mystery teachers of the heavens."  <br>  <br><br>- Note: These astronomers were the first priesthoods on which later sects and cults were based. It was their star lore which was disfigured by lesser minds as the centuries passed. ([Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073I4XW8/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1) for more of their story...)  <br>      <br>    <br><br>A later theology has wrought havoc with the begin previously evolved and naturally rendered, and we have consequently been egregiously misled and systematically duped by Semitic perversions.  <br>  <br>**Seven Stations of the Pole**  <br>In the Great Year of precession there are seven stations of the celestial pole. The pole changes, and its position is approximately determined by another central star about each 3,689 years.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This means that roughly every 3,700 years the earth's axis or pole aligns with one of the seven circumpolar stars in the northern sky. The complete orbit was the _original_ precessional zodiacal round of 25, 920 years or so. These seven great stars - the Lords of Eternity - were known by many names, such as the seven jackals, serpents, islands, rings, wheels, chalices, crowns, hermits, sages, etc. They appear in Judaism as the seven candlesticks or menorah. They were also figured as the celestial _ladder_, as seen in Masonry. Indeed, the letter G of Masonry, is the _seventh_ letter. The seven holy ones are the probable origin for the so-called seven chakras. ([Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073I4XW8/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1) for more...)<br><br>  <br>When the Stellar Cult was founded, the seven Pole Stars of Ursa Minor had been identified and established in the circle of precession; six of these were ever moving with the sphere, but there was always one remaining fixed at the centre.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This was the original zodiac of seven stations, closely watched and worshiped by the priests of the most ancient Stellar Cult. Eventually, under the epoch of the Solar Cult the focus shifted to the eastern horizon and Vernal Equinox point. This zone became the beginning of the solar year, followed by twelve divisions. The Great Bear (Ursa Major) was no longer the keeper of time. This is one account (probably the original) of the so-called "Fall" From this epoch on the position of the sun's yearly and platonic birth during the Spring (Vernal) Equinox). Originally it had been during the rise of the Nile's waters, at the period of the Inundation in September (now July). Because he arose from the sacred waters, he was at this point the fish god. Later he was styled as the lamb. The stories of the birth of Sargon, Nebo and Moses, etc, are based on the Stellar Mythos which has the solar king pulled from the sacred waters. The seven sages, kings, travelers, sleepers, etc, were adapted by numerous cultures, even turning up as the seven "dwarves" in fictional renderings.<br><br>  <br>...the Stellar Cult priests having all details connected with the astronomical and mathematical problems, as their knowledge on these matters was far superior in every way than that of the Solar Cult priests.  <br>  <br>In the Solar Cult "the place of  coming  forth"  had been given to Horus (as typified by the Sun) in the East, and the East therefore became  "The  Holy Land" of the Solar Cult people, in place of the earliest _Ta-Neter_ or "Holy Land" of the earlier Egyptians,  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Again this is the original state of Fall that as a motif was appropriated and reapplied by other mystery traditions. This was the fall or declination of one _mythos,_ the loss of one great cult's choice symbolism and ritual in favor of another's. The priest-ruler was one who best compiled a new coherent canon for the masses. This is seen more clearly in the case of the heretic king Akhenaton, in relation to his Atonist Cult, which cannibalized elements of the previous Amenist mythos. These changes of mythos are usually periods of major physical and intellectual desecration, and are rarely improvements. Indeed, in some cases previous gods, ways and customs suffer utter demonization. This was certainly the way with the Atonists, Israelites and Christians.<br><br>  <br>The secret of the sanctity of the Hebrew writings is that they were originally Egyptian.  <br>  <br>The wisdom of old, the myths, parables, and dark sayings that were preserved, have been presented to us dreadfully deformed in the course of being  converted  into history.  <br>  <br>**The Great Bear**  <br>In the Stellar  Cult the   Great   Bear  made  a  circuit on the outside of the "never-setting stars," and  the birthplace in heaven was imaged as the leg or haunch (Meskhen) constellated in the circle of perpetual visibility.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This is the original garden of paradise, the northern enclosure of everlasting souls or stars. This zone was rescripted by later cults, and eventually became the cradle or "manger" of Jesus. The great hippo mother goddess Taurt was transmogrified into Mother Mary. ([Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OE2TI6/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i6) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**Crocodile God** **Sobek**  <br>For the Stellar Cult, the solar child was pictorialized as the crocodile, born of the sacred waters, the heavenly waters wherein the supreme Hippo goddess Taurt (or Apt) reigned. It is for this reason the selected noble was made pharaoh after he was anointed with _chrism,_ that is the fat of the crocodile. He was "christened" and made into the Karast (or Christ), the "god made flesh." In this sense, the crocodile was the "serpent" child of the great mother. Images from early times show the goddess suckling the baby crocodile god. Even the term "messiah" traces back to this initiation with crocodile oil. Although the Jews had no ritual of baptism, the Egyptians certainly did - Mtsar|---|

|---|---|---|
|---|**Taurt**  <br>The superhuman force that hauled the system  round was imaged as a mighty monster swimming the Celestial Lake, a Hippopotamus or a Crocodile, or compound of both; also as the Great Mother of revolution, as  Goddess Apt depicted in the Great Bear, as the Great Mother who gave birth to the seven circumpolar gods, all brothers, and called in the Ritual the "Bulls of their Mother."  <br>  <br>These were the seven elemental powers brought on and now divinized, and  were  :figuratively grouped in a bark that voyaged round the pole, or as Ursa Minor, with seven souls or glorious ones onboard, seen in the seven  Stars  that  never set, a primary type of the eternal.  <br>  <br>The God of Sabaoth of the Hebrews is the Deity of the seven Pole Stars, i.e. Ursa Minor. The Deity that was primary Set of the Egyptians, and later Horus, took his place. Set was the El Shaddai of the Phoenicians and Hebrews.  <br>  <br>The seven Pole Stars were also imaged to represent the seven Stellar Gods with Horus as the Chief, making _eight_.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Many other goddesses of Egypt was personifications of the great Taurt. The goddess Apt, associated with the Great Bear constellation, was her closest personification, but we have goddesses such as Kep, Rannut and even Hathor and Isis to consider. She was defaced by the Jews and Christians, becoming the demonic Tiamat, Leviathan, red dragon or harlot, etc. She was the antetype for the Virgin Mary, who in many depictions still has a corona of stars.<br><br>  <br>Two different types of the Great Mother are imaged as Taurt or the Earth Mother in one character, as Apt the Water-Cow of Heaven and Nut the Mother of Heaven as  the Milch Cow.  <br>  <br>A Temple at Dendera has the Constellation of the Hippopotamus and the Thigh for the centre of the zodiac, which although made during the Solar Cult, very late, depicts the "original Stellar Cult portrayal" very distinctly, i.e., "The Leg of Nut" the "Milch Cow  of Heaven" and "Sustainer of  the  Pole."  <br>  <br>**Serpent Symbolism**  <br>Sobek was the antetype of the great serpent, symbol of the child, companion and agent of the goddess - Mtsar  <br>  <br>The Hebrews follow the  Babylonians in confusing the Ureus-Serpent of life with the serpent of death. The primal curse was brought into the world by Apap the reptile of drought, dearth and  darkness, plague and disease.  <br>  <br>**Set**  <br>That Sut or Set was first primary god of the Egyptians, but was god of the South Pole or Southern Hemisphere.  <br>  <br>Temples were built and dedicated to Set, not only in Egypt, but in many parts of the world, wherever the earlier exodus had settled. Set was the El Shaddai of the Hebrews and Phoenicians.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Churchward shows that Set was one of Egypt's oldest deities, and was probably the chief god of the Stellar Cult. This means that Set-worshipers, such as the Hyksos, may not have been invaders from lands beyond Egypt. It may be that Ralph Ellis is correct when he situates the Hyksos nobility in _Lower Egypt._ Their so-called invasion was, in this case, their entrance into Upper Egypt. In any case, despite the identity of Set-worshipers, Churchward is adamant about Set's great antiquity. He shows that Set was the antetype for El Shaddai and Jehovah. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-3.html) for more...)<br><br>  <br>The Pyramid Text also shows the change from Set to Horus and the appropriating of all Set's previous attributes to Horus.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Churchward thinks that Anubis ("Opener of the Ways") was a later variant based on Set. Set was the _original_ god of the underworld. This leads us to consider Set to have been demoted because he was worshiped by the "evil ones" (the Hyksos), not because he was evil himself. He'd been venerated for millennia before his demotion.  <br>    <br><br>  <br>Set was the Spirit of the  Mountain  stone  and sand, the red and arid ground, as distinguished from the moist, black soil of the valley. He was cruel and treacherous, always ready to  shrivel  up  the  harvest with  his  burning breath, and to smother Egypt  beneath  a shroud  of shifting  sand - Maspero (_Dawn of Civilization_)  <br>  <br>The first uranographic portrayal of paradise was a Stellar enclosure round the pole of Set in the Southern Heavens, which  was  followed  later, when the followers of Horus came North, by the configurating of the circumpolar paradise in the Northern Heavens by the astronomers when they reached the land of Egypt from the  South.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: One loses sight of southern constellations and stars as they migrate northward. This physical move demands a new construct and mythos. Once the new paradigm is established, over time the previous leitmotifs and iconography suffers declination. The southern icons are recast as lost, evil or fallen. They are of the abyss or underworld.  <br>    <br><br>  <br>**Set & Horus**  <br>Bel or Baai, who was Set as primary God of the Pole Star South, afterwards Horus of the Pole Star North, was no longer to be considered "the One God."  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This is one reason why images exist showing Horus and Set as a single entity, with two heads emerging from one body. This rendering is from the Stellar Mythos, in which Set is Lord of the Southern Hemisphere, and connected with the Southern Cross. His symbol was the inverted cross, picked up and disfigured by Christian mythmongers who had forgotten the original astrological significance and application.<br><br>  <br>That South of the Equator, Set was primary deity; at the Equator, Set and Horus were equal; but that as they came North, Horus became primary.  <br>  <br>The myth had shifted or changed places. The domain of paradise of the South with Set as God of the South, had shifted to the paradise of the North, with Horus as God of the North.  <br>  <br>Two pillars or poles were used sometimes to depict the North and South divisions of heaven, and symbolized as the two supports.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Set was the Lord of the Southern hemisphere. Churchward believes a great many leitmotifs later found in Solar Cult cosmology and myth came from this earlier cult of the South.<br><br>  <br>In the Stellar Cult, the constellation representing Hydra represented the Apap reptile.  It is figured in the waters of the Southern Heavens.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Hydra or Apophis was the reversed image of Taurt in the north. Two rival mother goddesses with sons. The ancients may have been fascinated by the counter motion of the stars seen in the southern hemisphere, and been eager to represent this contrariness in the mythos as the rivalry between the son of light and son of darkness.<br><br>  <br>**Crucifixion**  <br>There is one thing, however, very  definite and  clear, and that...is the portrayal of Horus being crucified, occurred during the old Stellar Cult, and that the depiction was not on the cross, but on the "two Poles."  <br>  <br>**The Great Pyramid**  <br>In Egypt the north celestial pole was variously imaged as a mountain summit,  an  island in the deep, a mound of  earth, a papyrus plant or lotus in the water of immensity, a tree, pole, pillar or pyramid, and  other types of the Apex of Heaven.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The equator was also considered a mount of hill of sorts. Mounds exist all over the world, especially in pre-Celtic and Celtic lands. Known as the _sidhe_, they in all cases represented the womb (and tomb) of the goddess.<br><br>  <br>I think this evidence supports my contention that the Great Pyramid was built by the followers of Horus to depict the astronomical Stellar Cult, and had nothing whatever to do with either the Lunar or later Solar Cult, which did not come into being for thousands of years after Menes, the first King of the First Dynasty.  <br>  <br>**Grove and Tree**  <br>The primal Stellar Cult paradise was the place of one tree. The paradise or garden in Amenta.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The tree is in this mythos the earth axis or pole. There are in effect _two_ poles, that of the north and that of south.<br><br>  <br>They enter the Aarru garden; they drink the water of life at its secret source in the Duat: they eat the fruit of the tree of life which is offered to Ani, the man,by the divine woman in the tree.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This scene in the grove was reprised in the form of the Christian Jesus in the garden, on the Mount of Olives, on Golgotha, and so on. The earlier account of Moses on Mount Sinai is also a variant of the original Stellar Mythos. The story of Eve's temptation by the serpent, and the fall of man is an idiotic retelling. In the original account the serpent is the companion of the goddess and protector of the grove. The great goddess offers her fruits to invigorate her solar child, not to cause his fall. The axis was rendered as the famous tree of life, and also figured as the scepter or wand carried by dignitaries. It was the original obelisk or column, the Djed Column or Tat Pillar.<br><br>  <br>**The Hyksos**  <br>The only historical documents we have  state that  after the Shepherd Kings, the Hyksos, had reigned at Memphis and Lower Egypt for some years; they were driven out to the east and there founded or built, Jerusalem 2554 BC, in the reign of Tuthmoses.  <br>  <br>The Hyksos period of "Shepherd Kings," and  their reign at Memphis and Lower Egypt, was 2554 BC, and when they were driven out of Egypt they went east and built Jerusalem.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This was the exodus _before_ that of Akhenaton (Moses). The Book of Exodus conflated two events and made it appear as if there was but one exodus of renegades from Egypt. The mythmongers focused on the latter event, presenting it in convoluted form. Failure to mention the name of the pharaoh of the exodus is proof positive that deception was involved, as it was 2,000 years later when mythmonger Josephus Flavius gave his account of the exodus, compiled from Jewish folklore and the innumerable comments and entries of rabbis through the millennia. Some scholars, such as Ralph Ellis, believe that the Hyksos Shepherd Kings were never complete outsiders who invaded Egypt at any time. They tend to believe that the Hyksos nobility were always rulers of _Lower Egypt,_ and only entered Upper Egypt at a later date. As worshipers of Set and the Southern Pole and stars, once the Hyksos found themselves forced from the southern lands, they could not longer physically see their beloved constellations. The further north one moves, the less are southern hemisphere constellations visible. The Hyksos decision to "invade" Egypt might have been to recover lands they believed were theirs by right, from which their tutelary astral divinities were visible. Churchward states that the Hyksos were members of the Stellar Cult, and tried to hold on to the Stellar Mythos regardless of the existence and resistance of other cults. it is for this reason that they were vilified, despised and deemed fallen or evil. As I show elsewhere, the Hyksos decided to pose as a Solar Cult. At Heliopolis their priests formed what came to be known as Atonism by which to hide their true beliefs and activities. Their later artifices, also appearing solar on the surface, are Judaism and Christianity.<br><br>  <br>...the Hyksos conquered  the Egyptians at Memphis they destroyed all the Solar Cult of Ptah and re-introduced the Stellar  Cult. The  Hyksos  took this latter cult with them when they were driven out of Egypt and founded Jerusalem.​​ The first temples there were Stellar, and not Solar. Indeed, there was much overlapping of the various Cults of Egypt - some were revived after a long  period of obscurity.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: As I show elsewhere, the Hyksos were comet worshipers. ([Here](http://www.femaleilluminati.com/article-6.html) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**Monotheism**  <br>The foundation of monotheism was laid when the various powers were combined in a single deity to be worshiped as the one true eternal spirit.  <br>  <br>**The Druids**  <br>Among the Druids the cave in the earth was a sign or symbol for the womb of the Bringer-fort; like the hole in a stone, it was the uterine symbol  of  the  Genetrix.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: Think of this in terms of the Little People whose haunts were generally _underground_.<br><br>  <br>**Resurrection?**  <br>In the Osirian representation Isis and Nephthys are the two women called the "two mourners" who weep and wail over Osiris in Rekhet, Isis and Nephthys, the two divine sisters, are the two women at the sepulchre of Osiris. They are portrayed, one at  the  head, the other at the  feet of the mummy.  <br><br>![Picture](https://www.astrotheologyzone.com/uploads/3/1/3/5/31352851/published/marytomb.jpg?1588397176)|---|

|---|Mary at the empty tomb. It's a very old story that doesn't originate with Jews and Christians. Despite disfigurement all the essential elements of the original Egyptian stellar story are there. The sun-king was born in the sign of the virgin, Virgo, hence Mother Mary. He is attended by the representatives of his mother, or by her twin, by her appointed ones. (The goddess is commonly a dyad.) In her maternal form she is his beginning and end, the Alpha and Omega. In her form as nurse and nurturer she is sister or wife. In maternal form she is Isis and also Nuith, the eternal night sky through which he must pass during the day and night. Jesus is the equivalent of Horus and Shu. His parents are Isis and Osiris, or Geb and Nuith, depending on the tradition. The name Eve comes from the alternative name of Taurt, namely Kefa, Khefa or Kheva. Of course, in the undefaced saga, Adam (Horus or Sobek-Ra) is _her_ child.|---|

|---|**Revelation**  <br>The Book of Revelation was derived from the wisdom of Egypt, and can easily be understood by the Khemite (Egyptian) Mysteries, but not otherwise. In the Stellar Cult, heaven is the Celestial heptanomis that was formed in seven astronomes, on seven hills or seven islands, which sank and passed away.  <br>  <br>**Goddess Disfigured**  <br>In Revelation the most ancient genetrix is reproduced as the great harlot. She is the beast that sat upon the waters as a pregnant hippopotamus.  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The precedent was set by the rabbis and Jewish mythmongers who sought to downplay any reference to Yahweh's family. The so-called Book of Revelation has been traced back to the Roman "Sibylline Oracles." It had nothing to do with Christianity or Judaism prior to being plagiarized and cannibalized by their cunning mythographers.<br><br>  <br>In Revelation the Mother of Mystery is called "Babylon the Great," the mother of harlots and of abominations of the earth who has the name of mystery written on her forehead...Here is a figure of the greatest antiquity in the Stellar Cult which was uranographically represented as the red hippopotamus that preceded the Great Bear.|---|
