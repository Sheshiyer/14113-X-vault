**Introduction**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_A religion which sedulously opposes its own improvement can do nothing essential toward improving anything else...On the contrary, it must check the growth of everything it touches with its palsied hands -_ Kersey Graves|

Throughout my work I have attempted to discover where the various Judeo-Christian traditions originally came from. Seeking these origins is, in my opinion, of vital importance for it yields invaluable information about the _present_ sorry human condition.  
  
However, the question of origins must remain secondary to the more vital question concerning the _validity_ of the myriad tenets of religion (specifically of Judeo-Christianity). The question of primary importance concerns whether or not the various religious tenets, customs, doctrines, dogmas and traditions have any _rational_ value. Do they contribute to humanity's healthy development or do they restrain and inhibit such progress? Do they contribute to the spiritual wealth of nations and peoples, or are they a corrupting influence? Do they explain the mysteries of microcosm and macrocosm, or do they prevent understanding? After all, concern is warranted when we hear illustrious churchmen and theologians, in the vein of Tertullian and Augustine, loudly proclaiming that belief in God is legitimate "because it is absurd."  
  
Do Christian tenets breed love of virtue and truth, as great philosophy should, or do they subvert the natural intelligence of human beings, thereby leading to greater mental infantilism and moral meltdown? Do they provide insight for a philosophically-minded seeker, for naturally moral men, or do they satiate the sullied palates of fools, huxters and sadists? Are we knee-deep in the latter sort of creature today because of irrational belief in a psychotic god, a hypocritical religion, and a sadistic, necrophiliac priesthood?

||_I never reason on religion. None but the disciples of devils reason. Its dangerous to reason on religion -_ Rev. Moody (American Clergyman)  <br>  <br>_By far the greater part of those who embraced the Christian religion in this its infancy being men of mean extraction and wholly illiterate, it could not otherwise happen but that a great scarcity should be experienced in the churches of persons possessing the qualifications requisite for initiating the ignorance and communicating instruction to them with a due degree of readiness and skill_ - Johann Lorenz von Mosheim (17th century German Church historian)|

Certainly we understand Judeo-Christianity to be antique, and we now have a fair idea as to where and how it originated. What must be addressed is its overall significance. That which served mankind yesterday may be of little use today. That which inhibited man's natural evolution is of no value. That which poisoned and drugged humanity in the past must not be allowed to so infect incoming souls who must be allowed to inherit a sane and safe world in which they can know truth directly, and in which they can _know themselves,_ as the great oracles of old directed.  
  
In the course of my expose I intend to clearly show how the Universal Intelligence (Voice of God) works with, or communicates through, the consciousness of human beings. Indeed, it is my contention that the force known as God, works through or _is_ the human reason. The reason is the Creator's _true_ revelation to man. Therefore it follows that the nature of any man's character - as well as his moral sensibility or virtue - depends on the manner in which he _utilizes_ reason.  
  
It is for man to perfect, by _use_, the faculty that makes living an enriching and meaningful experience. To understand and apply religious tenets and principles presupposes good moral intention and a mind already sanctified. Only a rational mind can understand the supposed communications of God, should God exist. Reason is, therefore necessary to true revelation. Since reason is greater than revelation, we see how damaging and sinister it is when we are told by clerics to never question the scriptures or ask whether the "infallible" words of God make rational sense. The priests and pastors are quite content to have us do what Saint Augustine did and believe the scriptures "because they are absurd." Millions of people show themselves more than capable of such self-deception.

|   |   |

||_For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent....Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen_ - (I Corinthians 1:10 & 27, 28)|

If human reason is the "God" within, then it logically follows that anything that confounds or subverts reason must be the cause of corruption and confusion. It follows that the irrational and unsound must be exposed, routed out and cast aside. To have things remain as they are ensures that progress will be stymied. This is real Holy Work. It is by way of deconstructive and apophatic reasoning that we come upon the Truth in all areas and matters.

||_Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty of unconsciousness, destruction_ - Ayn Rand|

The splendid gardens of the human reason and imagination must be kept clean of the weeds of superstition and error. A lie concerning the world, or the divine, is a lie that must be exposed by reason - a reason that is sharp and decisive.  
  
The word _sanity_ comes from the same root as the word _sanitize_ and so, like bodily health, the mind must also be _hygienic_ in order to operate excellently. Unfortunately most minds are anything but hygienic. Our environment is saturated with corrupting and contaminating agents that _intoxicate_ both the mind and the emotions. Man's spurious religious beliefs are in our opinion the chief source of psychic intoxication, absurdity and spiritual delirium.  
  
Reason exalts man, and the right operation of reason leads us toward the truth of ourselves. It allows us to glean a meaning for existence and for our role in the world. The correct use of reason is deconstructive in nature. Reason deciphers, discriminates, judges and identifies falsity. Mentally and spiritually, reason is - despite its limitations - the supreme agent of hygiene.  
  
With this in mind we see that anything which confounds reason must be considered _evil_. In our opinion the Judeo-Christian creed, as presented and codified by the churches, is such an evil. To prove our contentious and iconoclastic statement, we present the reader with the very material in the Old and New Testaments that we consider irrational and, therefore, morally and spiritually subversive.

||_…for the better part of 2000 years the Old Testament was the sole record of the Mesopotamian patriarchal era. There was no way for anyone to know if it was fact or fiction…it was taken on board for history_ - Laurence Gardner  <br>  <br>_There is nothing holy about the Bible, nor is it “the word of God.” It was not written by God-inspired saints, but by power-seeking priests. Who but priests consider sin the paramount issue? Who but priests write volumes of religious rites and rituals? No one, but for these priestly scribes were sin and rituals imperatives. Their purpose was to found an awe-inspiring religion. By this intellectual tyranny they sought to gain control, and they achieved it. By 400 BC, they were the masters of ancient Israel. For such a great project they needed a theme, a framework, and this they found in the Creation lore of more knowledgeable races. This they commandeered and perverted – the natural to the supernatural, and the truth to error. The Bible is, we assert, but priest-perverted cosmology -_ Lloyd Graham (_Myths and Deceptions of the Bible_)|

THE BIBLE OF BIBLES  
 (Selections from Kersey Graves)

||_The Christian religion depends for the sanction and validity of its beliefs upon the Bible as does the earth upon the sun for its light, heat and life...But of the whole body of Christians who accept it and believe in it, who found their faith upon it, no two sects believe it alike; all the schisms, and heresies, and persecutions, and religious wars, and religious intolerances and bigotries which past history has recorded and current history chronicles, are due alone to the differences of belief engendered by the indubitable inconsistencies and contradictions of the texts of inspired truth of this "Holy Bible, Book Divine"_ - Joseph Wheless (_Is it God's Word?_)|

In this section it is our privilege to present the work of the great American scholar Kersey Graves (1813-1883).  
  
This master revisionist and critic of religion had his work suppressed and condemned, and his great books are difficult to find today. Along with Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Kersey Graves was one of the great American free-thinkers dedicated to help remove the ancient chains of superstition from humanity. That these exceptional men's names are not known to the average American, and to the people of the world is in our opinion a travesty that we are committed to set aright. The quotes and the excerpts presented here are abstracted from the book composed in 1923 entitled _The_ _Bible of Bibles_.  
  
The interested reader is also referred to his previously penned masterpiece entitled _The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors_. Both works are available from [Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=kersey%20graves&index=blended&link_code=qs&sourceid=Mozilla-search&tag=mozilla-20)

**Preliminaries**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_There are many errors in the Bible. The learned know it; and the unlearned better not know it -_ William Penn|

The many errors, absurdities and contradictions presented here have not gone unnoticed by the Protestant and Catholic clergymen. They have had their apologists and experts make their futile attempts to account for the unaccountable and to explain the inexplicable. However, as humanity progresses, and as their various subterfuges become exposed, the harder their labor becomes. It becomes more and more difficult for them to convince rational men why they should merely accept the Bible as the inspired word of God.  
  
Of the many strategies employed by the clergy to explain the gross errata, there is one of especial perfidy and importance. It is reliance on the testimony of spurious "historians" who most likely never existed. This is not as incredible a strategy as we may first believe. It has served to cover many inconsistencies that compromise the professed accuracy and legitimacy of the Jewish and Christian scriptures. Since the scriptures themselves are of spurious origin, it is but one duplicitous step more to create fictitious experts, commentators, authorities and clerics to ostensibly "explain" corrupt texts that must either be accounted for or cast aside forever. Our amazement is lessened when we understand just how easy it is to fake, forge and falsely authenticate. It is not in the art world alone that we find the artifice of the forger and plagiarizer. The greatest examples of this kind of fraudulence are to be found in ecclesiastical circles. The only difference is that the experts in the art world are truly ignorant of their errors in judgment, whereas the experts in the latter case are the culprits in need of exposure. The forger who destroys the original from which he has worked is less likely to be found out. His crime can possibly, in practice as well as in theory, live forever.  
  
When we open a Biblical encyclopedia and see the names and sketches of the many illustrious historians, commentators, clerics, theologians and Church Fathers, it is not our first thought to doubt their existence. We do not automatically suspect that these figures of the past are concoctions. Those with names such as Herodotus, Paul, Eusebius, Josephus, Origen, Tertullian, and so on, have not had their existence proven beyond doubt and, once we are on to the game, we soon can judge from what ancient Roman "think tank" their names and identities were born. Outside the brave work of Conor MacDari, John Remsberg, Kersey Graves and James Wheless, few writers have taken on the task of delving into the professed existence of the many "historians" and "theologians" put before us since the early centuries AD; those to whom millions have turned for explanations of Biblical conundrums.  
  
In short, there is a scandalous campaign of forgery to be exposed, one of massive scale designed to rob man of his sanity and sound judgment, one meant to cover a barrage of garbled inconsistency and illogical philosophy that could not, in any rational age, hold sway over the minds of men - Mtsar  

**Quotes from the Master**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Quaker church (of which this author was once a member) have a clause in their discipline forbidding their members to read pernicious books..."such books and publications as contain language which appears to sanction crime or wrong practices, or teach bad morals" ...the Christian Bible may be ranked with works of this character_ - Kersey Graves (_Bible of Bibles,_ 1863 AD)  <br>  <br>_...its chronology is unreliable, chimerical, and incorrect; its history contradictory and incredible; its philosophy fallacious; its logic unsound; its cosmology foolish and absurd, its astronomy fragmentary and childish; its religion pagan-derived, its morals defective, sometimes selfish, often extravagant, and in some cases pernicious...It is often dark, ambiguous, and mysterious, as well as contradictory, not only in its lessons on morality, but in its account of the simplest occurrences, this rendering it comparatively worthless as a moral guide_ - ibid  <br>  <br>_The Gospels and Epistles thus voted into favor were not arranged together in the form of an authentic Bible until...the Council of Laodicea in the year 353. After this, council after council was called to vote in or vote out some of the books adopted by previous councils, and to settle some important church dogmas. The first council voted the Acts of the Apostles and Revelations out of the Bible...but the second council, which met in 363 voted them in again. Another council, which met in 406, voted them, with several other books, out of the Bible again. And thus were books and dogmas voted in and voted out of "the infallible and inspired word of god," and altered and corrected, time after time and century after century, by twenty-four different councils, composed by bigoted bishops and clergymen, so quarrelsome and belligerent that they resorted to fisticuffs fighting in several of the councils_ - ibid  <br>  <br>_The version of the Old Testament made under Ptolemy Philadelphus, 287 BC - the most reliable version extant - the Bishop Usher pronounces a spurious copy, full of interpolations, additions, and alterations. He says, "The translators of the Septuagint added to, and took from, and changed at pleasure," and Saint Jerome says that Origen did the same thing with the "New Testament." Bishop Marsh testifies, in like manner, that Origen, who first collected the Bible books together, confessed that he made many alterations in them before they fell into the hands of the Council of Nice. Dr. Bentley admits that the best copy of the New Testament contains hundreds of irreparable omissions, errors, and mistakes. The Rev. Dr. Whitby says, "Many corruptions and interpolations were made almost in the apostolic age." Dupin says, "Several authors took the liberty to add, retrench, correct divers things"...We are told that Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, made countless numbers of alterations in the Bible of the sixth century for the purpose of making them suit his Church. Eusebius says he found so much proof that the Gospel of Matthew had been altered and corrupted, that he rejected it as being unworthy of confidence. Victor Wilson informs us that a general alteration of the Gospels took place at Constantinople in the year 506, by order of the Emperor Anastasius, St. Jerome complains that in his time many alterations had been made in the Bible...Scaliger testifies that the clergy and the churches put into their scriptures whatever they thought would serve their purpose. Michaelis says, "They thrust in and thrust out as best suits fancy" -_ ibid  <br>  <br>_There is one text in Galatians (3:20) which, Christian writers inform us, has received no less than two hundred and forty interpretations at different times by different writers; that is, two hundred and forty guesses have been made at the meaning of this one text__-_ ibid  <br>  <br>_The Roman-Catholic Bible differs essentially from that of the Protestants, having fourteen more books. The Bible of the Greek Church differs from both. The Campbellites have a translation of their own. The Samaritan Bible contains only the five books of Moses. The Unitarians, having found 24,000 errors in the popular translation, made another translation containing still many thousands errors. The American Christian Union, having found many thousands of errors in the King James Translation, are now engaged in a new translation. How many more are we to have, god only knows. Martin Luther condemned eleven books of the Bible...and thus made a Bible for himself. Paul's Epistles to the Hebrews he denounced in strong terms...Dr. Lardner and John Calvin each condemned five or six books, and had a Bible peculiar to themselves. Grotius places the heel of condemnation on several books of the Bible. Bishop Baxter voted down eight books as uninspired, and unworthy of confidence. Swedenborg accepted only the Four Gospels and Revelation as inspired. The German Fathers rejected the Gospel of Matthew...The Bible of the learned Christian writer Evanson did not contain either Matthew, Mark, or John. The Unitarian Bible does not contain Hebrews, James, Jude, or Revelation. The Catholics denounce the Protestant Bible, and the Protestants condemn the Catholic Bible, as being full or errors_ - ibid|

**Source of the Problem**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_All the orthodox systems committed a fatal error at the outset in assuming that their religions were derived directly from God, and consequently must be perfect and unalterable, and a finality in moral and religious progress. Such an assumption will cause the downfall, sooner or later, of any religious body which persists in propagating the error. Religious institutions, like all other institutions, are subject to the laws of growth and decay  <br>  <br>The implied assumption of the churches, that their doctrines are too perfect to be improved and too sacred to be investigated, and their Bible too holy to be criticized, is contradicted both by history and science; and this false assumption has already driven many of the best minds of the age from their ranks  <br>  <br>A religion which sedulously opposes its own improvement can do nothing essential toward improving anything else...On the contrary, it must check the growth of everything it touches with its palsied hands_|

**Suppressive and Regressive**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...no church in any age of the world has inaugurated any great system of reform for the improvement of society, but has made war on nearly every reform set on foot by that class of people which it has chosen to stigmatize as "infidels"_|

**Believing the Absurd**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Saint Augustine furnishes another striking illustration of the total wreck of mind and moral principle which an obstinate determination to accept the Bible with all its errors is capable of effecting. Having found a great many absurdities in the Bible which he could not reconcile with reason and sense, and hence discovering he must either give up his Bible or his reason, he chose the latter alternative, and declared in his "Book of Sermons" - "I believe things in the Bible because they are absurd. I believe them because they are impossible," as glaring an absurdity as was ever issued from human lips. Such a desperate expedient to save his Bible and creed from going overboard shows that they had demoralized his mind, and made a complete wreck of his reason_|

Naturally, the rational person cannot believe an absurdity. However, the unsane person has no problem at all doing so. We must understand how easy it is for the psychologically insecure, existentially vagrant individual to distort the world into a form which suits his own warped vision and mentality. The toxic mind not only sees a toxic world, it _creates_ one. It is a disturbed and insecure mind which requires a god to rely upon. The mind that cannot feel its own empowerment and that has no sense of Self, is able to center its belief on a dubious, unrealistic, invisible power, essentially greater, and in most cases, external, to itself. This person with this kind of mental disease will then cleave to the company of other people of the same persuasion. These minds will assume their own "Consenus-Trance" and will follow their psychically projected "holographic" god wherever it seems to lead them. If and when the higher centers of logic demand a rational explanation for such antihuman actions and beliefs, the irrational person forcibly quells the remonstrations, repressing all dissent beneath an inflexible and morbidly rigid non-negotiable set of equally irrational pseudo-arguments. This kind of behavior in turn fosters great unconscious unrest that, in its own turn spurs the host to yet further dangerous identification with the supposed source of his pseudo-peace and salvation. Regardless of what horrors occur on the external stage, and regardless of what angst is felt within, there is little chance of breaking the spell or the hex. Once man venerates an authority and wisdom-source outside of himself, he is condemned to live estranged from the true source of wisdom that exists within his own temple. The man so divided from his own sanctity is a plague upon the world, a curse to everyone and everything he encounters - Mtsar

    _By faith ye are saved, and not of yourselves, it is the gift of God_ - Paul (Ephesians 2:8)  

**Many World Bibles**  
More than twenty sacred books have been found in various countries, which, if not in all cases denominated Bibles, have at least been venerated and used as such, and, properly speaking, are Bibles...All of these Bibles possess some common characteristics.   

- All of them claim to be inspired  
      
    
- All were claimed to be an embodiment of wisdom and knowledge far transcending the ordinary attainments of man  
      
    
- All were penned by inspired men, who were shielded from the possibility of erring while writing them  
      
    
- Each Bible is a finality in religious knowledge  
      
    
- Each one is an authority from which there is no appeal  
      
    
- It is a sin to question or doubt the truth of any of them, or to suggest the possibility of their containing errors  
      
    
- Some of them were written by god, some by angels, and others by inspired men  
      
    
- Each one points out the only safe and certain road to heaven  
      
    
- He who is a disbeliever in any one of these holy books is an infidel  
      
    
- Each one is to effect the salvation of the whole human race

**Paul on the Bible-less Gentiles**  
In an astounding passage in his Epistles to the Romans, Paul admits that men can have morality and ethics without the need of any Bible. He says:        

         _The Gentiles, who have not the Bible, do by nature the things contained in the Bible_  

One can only wonder why we have not heard more debate about this passage. And if Paul (the supposed author) really meant this, we have a great deal to debate. This passage is letting us know that one does not necessarily need the Bible to be moral, a great contradiction to what has been said by the clergy who set forth the Bible as man's only means to morality and salvation.  
  
There is another passage containing the same strange message from Paul:

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The invisible things of God are clearly seen and understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead_ - (Rom 1:20)|

So we are to understand nature as a teacher of the ways of God, not the Bible. The very essence of God is discerned through the physical and natural world. Why was this fact not taught by those who went around, in the name of Christianity, slaughtering all the nation's indigenous people?  
  
In same vein, we find Jesus himself saying: _Know ye not of yourselves what is right?_

**"Authorized" Does Not Mean "Authentic"**  
Anyone who is familiar with the elements of the higher criticism knows that there are two stories of the Creation and the Fall of Man in the Book of Genesis. The first, or Priestly Account, was written in the fifth century BC, and extends through the beginning of Genesis through verse 3 of chapter 2. The second, or Jehovistic Account, begins with verse 4 of chapter 2, and extends through the third chapter. This version of the story was written in the eighth century BC. It is interesting to note the second narrative is about three-hundred years older than the first.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||In the Priestly Version: The earth emerges from the waters. it is saturated with moisture. In the Jehovistic Version: The world is at first a dry plain. There was no vegetation, because "the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth."  <br>  <br>In the Priestly Version: Birds and beasts are created before man. In the Jehovistic Version: All fowls of the air are made of the ground.  <br>  <br>In the Priestly Version: Man is created in the image of God. In the Jehovistic Version: Man is made out of the dust of the ground. It is only after eating of the forbidden fruit that god said: "Behold, the man is become as one of us."  <br>  <br>In the Priestly Version: Man is made Lord of the whole earth. In the Jehovistic Version: Man is merely placed in the garden to dress it and keep it.  <br>  <br>In the Priestly Version: Man and woman are created together, as the closing and completing work of the whole creation. In the Jehovistic Version: Man is created first, then beasts and birds are, which are named by man. Finally, woman is made out of a the man.|

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Orthodox Christians claim that both of these stories must be believed, even though they contradict each other at numerous points_ - John G. Jackson (_Pagan Origins of the Christ Myth_)|

**The Wrath of Jehovah**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Jehovah, who of all the good gods adored by men was certainly the most jealous, the most vain, the most ferocious, the most unjust, the most bloodthirsty, the most despotic, and the most hostile to human dignity and liberty-Jehovah had just created Adam and Eve, to satisfy we know not what caprice; no doubt to while away his time, which must weigh heavy on his hands in his eternal egoistic solitude, or that he might have some new slaves. He generously placed at their disposal the whole earth, with all its fruits and animals, and set but a single limit to this complete enjoyment. He expressly forbade them from touching the fruit of the tree of knowledge. He wished, therefore, that man, destitute of all understanding of himself, should remain an eternal beast, ever on all-fours before the eternal God, his creator and his master. But here steps in Satan, the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds. He makes man ashamed of his bestial ignorance and obedience; he emancipates him, stamps upon his brow the seal of liberty and humanity, in urging him to disobey and eat of the fruit of knowledge_ - Mikhail Bakunin (_God and the State_)  <br>  <br>_Then, remembering that he was not only a God of vengeance and wrath, but also a God of love, after having tormented the existence of a few milliards of poor human beings and condemned them to an eternal hell, he took pity on the rest, and, to save them and reconcile his eternal and divine love with his eternal and divine anger, always greedy for victims and blood, he sent into the world, as an expiatory victim, his only son, that he might be killed by men. That is called the mystery of the Redemption, the basis of all the Christian religions. Still, if the divine Savior had saved the human world! But no; in the paradise promised by Christ, as we know, such being the formal announcement, the elect will number very few. The rest, the immense majority of the generations present and to come, will burn eternally in hell. In the meantime, to console us, God, ever just, ever good, hands over the earth to the government of the Napoleon Thirds, of the William Firsts, of the Ferdinands of Austria, and of the Alexanders of all the Russias…Such are the absurd tales that are told and the monstrous doctrines that are taught, in the full light of the nineteenth century, in all the public schools of Europe, at the express command of the government. They call this civilizing the people! Is it not plain that all these governments are systematic poisoners, interested stupefies of the masses?_ - Mikhail Bakunin (_God and the State_)|

**Creation From Nothing**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The first text in the Bible is evidently an error. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Gen 1)...The assumption involves two impossibilities. First, a creation could not take place without something to create from: "Ex nihilo nihil fit" - "out of nothing nothing can come"_ - Graves|

**God's Home Before the Creation**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_If God "created the heavens" (Gen 1) and heaven is his "dwelling place" (see 1 Kings 8:30), then where did he dwell before the heavens were made?_|

**Creation of the Light**  
God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day. Yet he did not make the light-producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_As we are told God created the light (Gen 1:3), the conclusion is forced upon us, that, prior to that period, he had spent eternity in darkness..."God saw the light that it was good" (Gen 1:4). Hence we must infer that God had just got his eyes open, and  that he had never before discovered that light is good. Of course it was good to be delivered from eternal darkness._|

**Dividing Light From Darkness**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_"And God divided the light from the darkness" (Gen 1:4). Hence, previous to that period, they must have been mixed together. Philosophy teaches that light and darkness never can be separated any more than heat and cold, as one is only a different degree of the other._|

**Birth of the Earth**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Bible teaches that the earth came into existence three days before the sun, but science teaches us that the earth is a child or offshoot of the sun._  <br>  <br>_"And the earth was without form, and void" says Genesis 1:2. But we wonder how it can be an earth at all then given the usual and rational meaning of the word void. How can an empty nothing be a something with a name? The Bible is off to a great start._|

**Vegetables Before Animals**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_According to the Bible, the vegetable kingdom was created before the animal; but the learned geologist Hitchcock, although a Christian by profession, in his "Elements of Geology" says "An examination of the rocks shows us that animals were created as early as vegetables' (and he might have said much earlier). And yet the Bible says vegetables were created on the third day, and animals on the fifth day._ (See Genesis 1)|

**Creating Sun and Moon**  
In the Bible we are told by the author that Jehovah created "mornings" and "evenings" before he created the sun. Is this another miracle, or just the product of the reasoning and scientific knowledge of the authors of this garbled travesty, composing centuries later, during the Dark Ages, after Christianity had already come into existence to plague the world?  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Bible tells us that "God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and god set them in the firmament to give light to the earth (Gen 1:16-17). That is, he made two round balls, and then stuck them into holes scooped out of the firmament for the purpose. This seems to be the idea. Here is disclosed the most egregious ignorance of astronomy. Think of that stupendous solar luminary, as much larger than this pygmy planet as a man is larger than a mouse,  being hung up or stuck up above us for our sole accommodation. How sublimely ridiculous!_|

**The Lord's Strange Creation Timetable**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Bible represents the great world-builder, the almighty architect, as spending five days in plodding and toiling at his little mole-hill of ours before he got it finished...and then made such a bad job of it that he repented for having undertaken it...But when he came to make the countless worlds, the vast suns, and systems of suns...these were all made in a few hours. "And he made the stars also."_|

**God Gets Dog Tired**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_According to the Bible, God became so tired in the business of world-making that he had to take a rest of a whole day...but geology and philosophy both teach that creation never was begun, and never will be finished, but is going on all the time._|

**More Insanity in the Making**  
Due to the controversy over the idea of a six-day creation, Biblical authorities came forth with a seemingly clever explanation. Without precedence they declared that a Biblical "day" was really a period of a thousand years. This seemed the right amount of time to cover the glitch in understanding. A hundred years might sound too short a time, and a million years was certainly too long in their minds. So, with no more ado, a Biblical "day" became a thousand years. Naturally, by the same logic a Biblical week could then be any amount of millennia, and a Biblical year could be any amount of aeons. All this bunk, when it would have been so simple to just have been given the actual length of time in the first place. But of course, we know that this was the problem. The amount of time to create the creation had to be left vague, since there was no such creation as is stipulated in the Bible. The creation, as mentioned in the Bible, is a creation of imagination for the imagination. There is not a shred of fact in it.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...we are told that a day in the Bible means a thousand years. Then, as the Sabbath day constitutes one of the days spoken of in the Bible, and was provided as a day of rest, Christians and the Bible believers should rest a thousand years at a time; and as God rested a whole day (a thousand years), he must have been as tired of resting as he was of world-making._|

**Which Came First?**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Bible teaches that whales, fish, and birds were made on the same day; but geology assures us that fish came into being long before fowl...The Bible teaches that beasts and creeping things were all made on the fifth day of creation; but geology tells us that reptiles and creeping things crawled upon the earth millions of years before beasts came into existence._|

**Creation of Eve**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_According to the Bible, a serious blunder was made by Jehovah in the work of creation, by exhausting all the materials in the process of world-making and man-making, so that nothing was left to make a "helpmeet" for Adam; and this blunder caused the necessity of robbing Adam of one of his ribs...But common sense teaches us that a small crooked bone but a few ounces in weight could not furnish half the material needed to constitute a woman. The Parsees , with a little more show of sense, tell us that the rib was used merely as a back-bone, around which the woman was constructed._|

In the first chapter of Genesis we are told that Adam and Eve are created together, at the same time, whereas in the second Chapter Eve is created after Adam. (Perhaps this was an editing error).  

**Adam's Free Time**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_As the Bible teaches that Adam named all the beasts, animals, and birds, it must have occupied a great number of years for the Lord God of Moses to have caught and taken the several hundred thousand species to Adam to receive names in all the three-thousand languages, and then convey them back to their respective climates. The question naturally arises, Why should Adam give them names...when there was nobody present to hear it and be benefited by it? And nobody could have remembered half the names had they been present._|

No, no one could have remembered the billions of animal names, and we can assume that Adam could not have remembered all the names he came up with for all the world's animals. Perhaps he wrote them down with pen and ink provided by the Lord. Perhaps, he was literate enough to read and write as well as name animals. One thing is for certain, Adam must have had a lot of free time to make this task his priority.  
  
**Two Creations**  
There are two Creation stories in the first book of the Bible. One can be found in Genesis Chapter 1, and the other in Chapter 2. In the first Chapter we read that the animals are created before Adam, and in the second Chapter, they are created afterwards. This is a major contradiction in the very same book, just lines away from each other. If this is the level of accuracy in the Bible, we are in trouble from the start. But then we encounter yet another contradiction. In chapter one we read that the earth is created several days before the firmament (heaven), whereas in the second Chapter of Genesis we read that earth and heaven are created on the same day.  
  
**Reason for Adam's Creation**  
Again, the account is contradictory. Genesis 1 says that Adam was created in gods image, but in Chapter 2 he was made to "till the ground" for there was no one to carry out this function. Pity god did not create an already tilled ground when he fashioned the earth. In the first story, Graves notes that man appears to be godlike, and therefore has dominion over the whole earth, whilst in the second chapter he is now a humble servant made to labor in the gardens of the Lord.  

- ﻿﻿This contradiction is also found between the various world accounts of man's creation. In our book _Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation_, we consider these contradictory accounts and highlight the alternative story of Adam and Eve and their supposed disobedience and "Fall." We explore the stories that were left out of the Bible, in which the Tree was guarded to prevent man eating of the forbidden fruit that would make him into a god, and in which we are given a very different portrayal of the serpent than the one provided in the Bible.﻿﻿  
    

**Tree of Life**  
There were two trees in the garden. They are central characters in the primal drama and yet we are told so little about them. One has been referred to as the "Tree of Life" and the other as the "Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil." These attributions are not explained and we are left to imagine what these trees really are and why they were put, as distractions, before the innocent pair whom god had filled with desire to sin. However, when we do our homework we discover that the Tree was a seminal creation image employed first by the Gaelic Magi in Ireland. From Ireland the symbol of the World Tree was transported to the Teutons and the Norsemen, and from there to other locales. The Tree was a symbol of organic creativity, of the movement and mystery of nature. It was a symbol which stylized the descent of creative energy from the supernal realms to the physical. The World Tree was the reverse of the physical tree. Instead of its life-force coming from the ground upward, the World Tree's vital force descended from on high downward. There were 22 branches on the Tree of Life, though the life-force traveled usually through 9 or 10 main centres or spheres. It was such a known and important leitmotif within the Gnostic and Hermetic Traditions of old, that it turned up in the Book of Genesis which, for all its contortions and unnecessary embellishments, is a replica of the Egyptian (and Irish) Creation Myths.  
  
That little is said of the Tree, except that it is an object of desire and forbidden intent, tells us that little was known of it by the Bible authors who appear to not be personally privy to the depth of the original canon that they were plagiarizing. Wherever else the Tree story appears in the world, it is always in the keeping of envious gods who are afraid that its secrets may be known to the angels and human creatures.  
  
In all these legends the serpent is the guardian of the tree, set there by god to protect it from the curious. In some stories the guardian is a monkey; the monkey being a form of the Egyptian god Thoth. In most cases the forbidden secrets of the Tree are available only to those who have the inherent ability to accept the secret. In the authentic telling of the legend, those without the inherent capacity for an understanding of the secret are neither attracted to the secret nor altered in any way from its proximity. In the tangled re-telling of Genesis, it is clear that the primal parents were being punished not for acting on sinful desires put in them by the Lord himself, but for their free-will, their free choice of action against the Lord's meaningless prohibition.  
  
They are penalized and ruined due to the operation of natural drives. They are disobedient to god but obedient to their own senses, their own heart's desire and their own natural inclinations. Though the serpent has come down to be a symbol of temptation, a proper reading of the drama shows the serpent to be more a symbol of independence and freedom. A slave is slave even if god is his master. And slavery is not spiritual, not in any time or in any place. Disobedience can only occur if one has to rebel against something that restrains. And such rebellion is a good and necessary thing. God does not reward man for his natural disobedience, but the serpent does. Man is bestowed total comprehension when he eats of the tree. He does have his eyes opened, and does not die, as Jehovah said he would. The serpent's word is more true than god's word. Adam becomes a god in his own right, and this is surely what compromises the god of the Old Testament. It is that Adam becomes his own authority that rankles the orthodox status quo. And this self-dependence is as taboo now as it was then. Sadly, most men have subconsciously accepted the Orwellian programming of "Obey and be Free!" Some few, however, know this Double-Speak to be the monstrous psychic tyranny it always has been.  

         _It grieved him to the heart that he had made so rebellious a creature as man_ - (Gen 6:6)  

**Adam Tormented**  
Adam was told that he would suffer death if he ate of the forbidden fruit. But as Graves relates, how would Adam have known or have feared the nature of the threat since he had never seen anything dead. And we can also question why Adam would have feared death if, as we are told, he was meant to be made in the image of god. Did our progenitor fear as we fear? Was his mind, even at that early time, filled with anxiety and foreboding?   

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Did God create beings in his own image and then treat them as if he wished to tantalize them and render them unhappy? It would seem that he created man for no other purpose than to tease and torment him, and quarrel with him. Common sense would suggest it to be the act of an ignoramus or a tyrant to implant in man the desire to eat fruit which he did not allow him to eat...God must have had the power without the will to prevent the act of disobedience, which would make him an unjust and unmerciful tyrant. Or else the will without the power, which would make him a weak and frail being, and not a God._|

The "God" spoken of in the Book of Genesis, and throughout the Christian scriptures, is psychologically speaking a projection of the human ego, which came into being 13,500 years ago in order to offset the complete psychic breakdown suffered by survivors of the great earth cataclysms and upheavals now known to have wrought havoc throughout the globe at that time. This "god" is an extension of the human drive or will to exist and is phylogenetically very young. It acts like a child and is patently animistic and violent. Like William Blake's devilish Orc, the ego was born in flames. Man could not have survived without the advent of the ego which, like a muscle, saved human consciousness from complete traumatic overload. However, since the ego was born from trauma of unimaginable magnitude, its drives are "spastic" and overly sensitized to threat. Should a threat appear from outside, the ego reacts with flight or fight tendencies. It does this on the personal level and collective level. The scriptures make a great deal more sense when it is understood how God is made in man's image. Man (Adam) has indeed been tormented by the God that saved him from annihilation. This "God" energy functions best under pressure of trauma, and this is why our world and our thinking is so malignant. Silence, calm, peace and respite are not conducive criteria for the existence of the ego or pseudo-self - the projector of the vengeful, brooding God who hides in plain sight.

||_Julian Jaynes…has suggested that human consciousness has changed its character even in historical times, the ego as we know it was not really in existence, except under extreme stress. And then it presented itself almost as an exterior intrusion into consciousness, like the voice of a god -_ Terrence McKenna (Institute of Noetic Sciences Magazine. September-November 2000 edition)  <br>  <br>_In the Origins of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, Julian Jaynes argued that self-consciousness emerged even more recently – at the time of the Bronze Age, some five thousand years ago. According to Jaynes, there was no sense of “I” before this period. It was their first experience of the Thinking Mind’s internal monologue, Jaynes speculates, that ancient peoples attributed to hearing the voice of god, or being addressed by spirits_ _­_ Gregg D. Jacobs (_The Ancestral Mind_)|

**Uniqueness of Jehovah**  
There is nothing very unique about Yahweh, as Massey, Kuhn, Graves and others have shown. He was not the only god of the Israelites and his name can be found in earlier times among differing peoples, later falsely purported to be the Israelites of the Old Testament. Moreover, every epithet given to Jehovah ("lord of heaven," "the most high," etc,) were used time and time again for Marduk, Baal, and other gods and deities of the ancient world. If Jehovah was so unique, why did his followers not come up with brand-new epithets? Why borrow from nations thought pagan and infidel? No, facts are facts; there is nothing unique or holy about the Jehovah of the Bible.  

**Nature of Jehovah**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The truth is, the imaginary God of the Jews was a suspicious, cowardly, and jealous being. He was constantly getting into hot water. He appeared to live in perpetual fear day and night that some other God, or some of his own creatures, would encroach upon his rights. In this case he seemed to be alarmed for fear those ignorant, deluded tower-builders and world fanatics would succeed in reaching the heavenly home, perhaps bind him, and cast him out of his own kingdom. What superlative nonsense is the whole story! And yet millions believe it to be divinely inspired, and many thousands of dollars have been spent in printing it, and circulating it over the world_ _-_ Kersey Graves (_Bible of Bibles_)|

**Jehovah's Anger**  
Man's god is nothing but a projection of his own ego-consciousness. Many are the proofs for this psychologically legitimate assertion. But one of the best proofs concerns the "all too human" traits of Jehovah.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...that a being infinite in power, infinite in wisdom, and filling all space throughout the boundless universe, should be a victim to the weakness and ungovernable impulse of passion...A being, therefore, who is assumed to possess such a weakness is self-evidently not a God, but merely a imaginary being, fit only to be worshiped by ignorant slaves -_ Graves|

**A Few Excerpts:**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Lord is a man of war_ - (Exodus 15:3)  <br>  <br>_Behold, the Lord rideth on a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.

**First Act of Genocide and Mayhem**  

            _Man's heart is evil from his youth -_ (Genesis)  

_God creates man and then laments that he has crea_ted such a wayward and evil thing. He first declares his world "good" but then, strangely, finds it so full of flaws, so full of evil, that he decides to eradicate the whole of his creation. He is full of remorse for creating man, but after he wipes out all creation, he is remorseful about that also, and promises never to do such a thing again (Gen 9). So Jehovah's response to evil in the world, is to commit an act of global genocide. We can only wonder at these accounts, and surmise that what god really objected to was not Adam and Eve's natures, but their lack of obedience. Was it the free-will exercised by the primal parents that so infuriated the Lord? Obedience is after all considered the foremost virtue in the Bible. And the opposite of obedience to authority is free will. Is this the reason for the wrath in the Book of Genesis? It certainly seems to be so.  
  
**The Deluge (Flood)**  
The story of an Ark, a Flood and of the world's destruction did not originate with the Bible's version. In fact, the story of Noah is quite a late rendition. Thousands of years before, the Irish Nuah or Nuada, brought his people to safety on Ireland's shores in long boats constructed to weather the destruction of Atlantis and the lost continents of old. All of the great nations had stories of a great flood and of the few survivors. The Persians and Chaldeans had their survivor Xisuthra, who was warned by god in a dream, and who was told to save his wife and daughter and every pair of animals in the world from the coming destruction by rain. The Greeks had their Deucalion whose story is almost identical. The Chinese have their Fohi, the Brahmins their Manu, and the Hindus their Satravarata. One legend the world over.   

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_For Shem, Ham and Japhet, the Hindus have a Sherma, Charma and Jyapheta -_ (Kersey Graves on the sons of Noah)|

**Building the Ark**  
God then goes to a drunkard ("man just and perfect") called Noah, and tells him to ensure his own family's survival by building a peculiar vessel that would ride out the cataclysms that the Lord was about to visit on the whole earth. Into this vessel two of every animal on the earth was to be loaded with enough food for its survival. This strange craft is 550 feet and has one small window of 18 square inches. Every animal that "creepeth" on the earth are gathered, and they embark in the ark in one day.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Lord instructed him (Noah) to build and ark five hundred and fifty feet long, ninety feet wide, and fifty-five feet high - about the size of an eastern warehouse...  <br>  <br>And God ordered to be taken into this ark food sufficient to supply these millions of mouths. This alone would have required forty such vessels. As it was declared that God destroyed everything every living thing from the face of the Earth, it would have been necessary to have food stored away to last several years, until the earth could have had time to be replenished with a new crop of grass and vegetables..._|

**Noah's Character**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_We are told that Noah became so drunk as to strip off all his clothing, and two of his sons, to avoid seeing him in that situation, walked backward, and covered him: for which at his father cursed him. Thus it was that Noah, although "a righteous man" was not a very modest or decent one._|

**A Very Full Ark**  
Consider for a moment what amount of food would be required for each species of animal. The four elephants...would consume a ton of hay in two days, making more than one hundred and fifty tons in twelve months. The fourteen rhinoceroses would consume one thousand and fifty tons. And then the horses, cattle, sheep, goats, asses, zebras, antelopes, and other mammals, would require at least two thousand tons more; making in the aggregate three-thousand two-hundred tons. This alone would have filled every inch of the vessel. The seven hundred and eighty-four thousand birds (one hundred and twelve thousand species) would require grain, which would make it necessary to store several thousand bushels. The three thousand flesh-eating animals, including lions, cats, dogs, jackals, hyenas, skunks, weasels, crocodiles, snakes, eagles, hawks, buzzards, etc. would require about forty wagon-loads to be slaughtered and fed to them each day, for all would require fresh meat but the buzzards - Graves  
  
And, of course, the list of ark inhabitants goes on considerably. There would have been otters, and kingfishers and storks, 900 species of fly-catchers and all manner of insects for them to feed on throughout the day and night, owls with field-mice to feast on, ant-eaters with millions of ants to satiate them, 442 species of monkeys requiring fresh fruit, millipedes, fleas, lice and cockroaches, etc, - Graves  
  
And think of the immense labor required to obtain this innumerable collection of animals. In the first place, either Noah or his god must make a trip to the polar regions to obtain the white bear, the reindeer, the polar dog, etc, And then the Rocky Mountains must be scaled to find and catch the grizzly bear. Some time and labor must have been required to obtain the rattlesnakes, copperheads, vipers, cobras, snapping-turtles, etc. of the torrid zone - Graves  
  
And how could this immense multitude of respiring and perspiring animals live and breathe in a vessel with but one little twenty-two-inch window, and that in the third story, and shut up most of the time to  keep the rain out, especially if some giraffe had been disposed to monopolize it when it was open by thrusting its head out...And what was there to prevent the nine hundred carnivorous animals from devouring the sheep, hogs, poultry, rabbits, minks,  hedgehogs, etc. as they tumbled pell-mell down the  mountain together - Graves  
  
But let us observe more closely the actions of Noah with his three sons and their three anonymous wives that, according to the Bible were the sole survivors of the corrupt world that existed before the great Flood, after spending a total of 375 days in their enormous ship! We will have to go into detail here, and read from the biblical text to make sure that the duration of the episode of the flood was not a mere 40 days, as almost all religious people are inclined to believe:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth_ - (Genesis 7)  <br>  <br>_Even while the Ark had settled for 70 days on land...and the raven is flying to and fro...after seven more days the dove is sent off...and finally by New Year's Eve the dove does not return any more...a very strange fact for a paired dove, that has lived a year in the ark. The dove does not return because the water had "subsided from off the earth." However, Noah did not decide to leave the ark, even then. He sat tight in the crowded ark for 57 more days until without making up his mind to open the ark even though the dove had left the ark never to return a couple of months before. It appears that the dove...did not play any role in Noah's decision to leave the ark, where the beasts of the Earth must have been living in a suffocating environment after an entire year of confinement_ - Michael Kalopoulos (_Biblical Religion: The Great Lie_)|

**God's Trouble-Making Serpent**           

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The idea of God creating a serpent to thwart and defeat his plans and designs, or permitting him to do it, is absolutely ridiculous.  <br>  <br>If God knew, when he created the serpent, that his machinations would bring "death and sin and all our woe" into the world, the act would prove him to be an unprincipled being. And, if he did not know it, he must have been ignorant and short-sighted, and not fit to be a God...It would seem that the serpent was superior to Jehovah either in knowledge or veracity; for his statement relative to the effect of eating the fruit proved to be true, while that of Jehovah proved to be false._ (See Genesis 3:3)|

**Crazy Story of Cain**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_How could Cain find a wife in the land of Nod (Gen 5:17) when he himself had killed the whole human race excepting his father and mother? There were then no women to make wives of. Why did Cain build a city (Gen 4:17), when there was nobody to inhabit it? As there were "workers of iron and brass" in this city, does it not furnish evidence that there was a race of people who had attained a high state of civilization before Adam was made...If Cain did find a wife in the land of Nod, is it not evidence that some of his ribs had been converted into women before Adam's time?...Did not Jehovah know, when he accepted Abel's offering and rejected Cain's, that he was sowing the seeds of discord that would lead to murder?_|

And we note also that Cain did not require any "serpent" to spur him to his murderous deed. So, was his action prompted by his own nature given him by god? Nowhere does it say otherwise. In this case, we have human beings whose malefic actions are not prompted by any external agency. How is this to be explained away?  
  
**Crazy Story of Moses**  
The story of the birth of Moses is a direct copy of that of Sargon the great Babylonian King. But if it were true, this is what we are being told:  
  
The Pharaoh becomes hostile to half Israelites like Moses' mother. He orders that all Israelite children should be killed at birth. We are not told the reason for this decision. The mid-wives disobey the Pharaoh, saying that the Israelite women give birth so fast and lively that they get their too late to do any killing (see Exodus1:22). Moses therefore survives, and his hidden by his mother. After a period of three months she strangely changes her mind about hiding him, and places him in a basket and sets him onto the river Nile, within shot of the Pharaohs palace. She comes so close to the palace that an unnamed Pharaoh's daughter espies the basket as it is travels through the reeds. We are not told why a loving mother who has been hiding her child from death, should suddenly decide to put her child onto the river for the crocodiles to eat. After the Pharaoh's daughter has her servants retrieve the basket, she falls in love with the foreign child and decides to take for herself. The fact that it was totally against the law for any unmarried Pharaoh's daughter to adopt a foreign child does not seem to worry this author, who penned this preposterous story centuries after the time it was said to have occurred. Nevertheless, the next amazing thing that happens concerns the immediate appearance of Miriam, the sister of Moses, who happened to be in the area watching what was happening. Now, seemingly with no care for her own security, she appears to the Pharaoh's daughter to ask her whether she needs a maid to look after the child she has just that moment found among the bulrushes. The Pharaoh's daughter decides that it would be a good idea to get a maid to look after the child, and Miriam suggests that she has the perfect care-giver - the original mother of Moses. She deceives the Pharaoh's daughter who, unwittingly, entrusts her son adopted infant back into the care of the real mother. We are not told why, at this point, the Israelite child is still not in mortal danger that was, after all, the reason for casting him out onto the river. We are never told why the son of Asiatic shepherds would be a threat to the King of Egypt, why his daughter would go against sacred law, or why she would not have care-givers of her own for her child. We are not told why Moses' mother was so close to the Pharaoh's palace, or why Miriam the strange sister should suddenly just appear at the right moment and be able to approach the bathing Pharaoh's daughter, who seems to be hanging around the banks of the Nile to wash herself, in public, as it seems.

||**Note**: (Did This Nonsense Happen?) - The scholars of the Bible vehemently assure us that, despite the implausibility of these tales, they are accurate and historical. They say that the name Moses does mean something in Hebrew so obviously Moses actually existed. And they have gone to the Talmud and the Koran to verify the Bible, and to the Bible to verify the Talmud, and to the Bible to re-verify the Koran. They have gone to the three books written by the same gang of liars to confirm the jive of each. Great scholarship. So, by this same token if a thing is not found mentioned in either the Bible, the Koran, or the Talmud, then it does not exist at all. Goodbye Mount Everest, and all those who have foolishly believed in you. You are not mentioned in the three magnificent tomes of religion, so you don't exist - get it!. Goodbye Pacific Ocean, Chartres Cathedral, and Hyde Park; goodbye Simon and Garfunkel, you aren't mentioned, so you don't, you can't exist. Wow! - a name, like "Joseph," actually meant something in Egyptian (or in Hebrew, Aramaic, Coptic, etc,), which means, of course, that Joseph, the Bible's Patriarch, must have lived. The name is real, and so the man must have been also. This is the kind of thing that passes for proof in Biblical circles, and which has convinced the masses of the Church goers and Bible bashers. The scholars think they can use sophistry to convince us that there was no malignancy in the minds of the chroniclers and authors of this clap-trap. However, their own words betray the truth, once we know how to read between lines. Here is a perfect example of lies being made palatable. (This quote is from Ahmed Osman's book _Christianity: An Ancient Egyptian Religion_.)  <br>  <br>It is reasonable to assume that scribes who wrote their accounts of these happenings many centuries later did not invent the facts but based what they wrote on genuine historical events whose memory had been transmitted orally for generations, with the distortions and accretions that are inevitable when stories are passed on by word of mouth.|

**Moses, Greatest Writer Ever**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...the man Moses, learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. (another Christian assurance; Acts vii, 22), sat down in the Wilderness of Sinai and under divine inspiration wrote his Five Books of prehistorical history, codes of postexilic divine Law, and chronicles of contemporary and future notable events, including four different names of his father-in-law...(Wz.: Jethro, Ex. iii, 1; Reuel, Ex. ii, 18; Jether, Ex. iv, 18, and Raguel, Num. x, 29, while a fifth name, Hobab, is awarded him in Judges iv, II), together with a graphic account of his own death and burial, and of the whole month afterwards spent by all Israel mourning his death_ - James Wheless (_Forgery in Christianity_, 1930)|

**Death of Aaron, Brother of Moses**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_He (Moses) also records the death of his brother Aaron at Mt. Hor (Num. xx, 28; xxxiii, 38), just six months before his own death; though, in amazing contradiction, he elsewhere records Aaron as having died at Mosera, just after leaving Sinai (Deut. x, 6), thirty-nine years previously...and thus nullifies the entire history of the wonderful career and deeds of Aaron as high priest during the whole 40 years of wandering in the Wilderness, of which the Books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers are largely filled_ - James Wheless (_Forgery in Christianity_, 1930)|

**Facts on the Exodus**  
Chapter 47 of the Book of Genesis, we read that Joseph was given the right by Pharaoh to bring his father and brothers into Egypt, to live in the area known as Goshen. It is from this event that the Israelites begin their stay in Egypt. God declares that his people will spend 400 years in Egypt as slaves (Gen. 15:13). However, in the same book, we have another figure given for the years of slavery. In Exodus 12:14, we read that the period of enslavement was 430 years.  
  
**The Red Sea Story**  
The Israelites come to an impassable sea. God causes a great wind to descend that is so strong it parts the waters pushing them back for a time, allowing the Israelites to cross. Of course we are not told how the Israelites could cross the Red Sea in such a wind, one so powerful as to push back millions of gallons of water. One would think that this wind would be more of a deterrent than the waters themselves.  
  
**Jehovah Captured**  
We are told, in the early books of the Bible, that Jehovah was contained in the Ark of the Covenant and carried around by the Israelites. He was carried by David into war against the Philistines who were winning many victories against the Lord's "Chosen People." Nevertheless, the Philistines slew 30,000 Israelites, captured the Ark with the Lord Jehovah inside, and took it with them as booty. After many decades, the Philistines decided they could not use the Ark and gave it back to the Israelites. As it was being driven home by two cows, it nearly fell off a cliff (Exodus 20:4). A character called Uzzah, seeing that it was about to topple from the road, stretched out his hand to save the cart. He was thanked by being destroyed by the Lord. When the Ark was passing through the city of Bethshemesh, the Lord killed 50,000 people just because two curious citizens had looked upon the Ark.  
  
We must ask how it is that God can be carried round in a box, and then be captured by enemies who then, later, return God to their enemies. We can ask but we can be sure to receive few rational answers. We might also want to avoid the histories that clearly refer to, and even depict, the Hindu Ark and the Egyptian Ark that were also carried aloft by the priests and that operated miraculously.  
  
**Daniel, Reader of Dreams**  
We are told that Daniel was brought before the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar to interpret his dreams. We are not told why Daniel could do what all the Babylonian Magi could not do for their king. Nevertheless, we also find that the king had even forgotten his dream completely. Daniel had to remind the king what his dream had been, before he set to interpreting it. This seems a very convenient set up, making the miraculous prophecy about as convincing as any stage conjurors legerdemain.  
  
**Prophecy and Magic**  
Prophecy, magic, astrology and the arts of divination are considered taboo by God and his ministers. However, the Bible itself is packed with prophecy. Is not the whole Book of Revelation, one long prophecy? And in Matthew 1-2, is not the angel who visited the "virgin" Mary, not making a direct prophecy when he says that a child, a savior, will be born unto her? Did not Jesus prophesize when he told his disciples that he would "come again?" Did not John the Baptist not prophesize that one would come who was "greater" than he? Additionally, did not Jesus prophesize the falling of the temple, the betrayals of Peter and Judas, and did not the "three wise men" know about the birth of Jesus through prophecy? Are not the births of Samson, John the Baptist, and Jesus miraculous. Do Aaron and Moses not engage in magical practices when they do the "rod and snake" trick in front of Pharaoh and his priests? Yes, prophecy and magic is all through the Bible, executed by those who are meant to be the elites among Biblical dramatis personae. Yet, the church forbids believers to empower themselves by Divination. What a mockery! What hypocrisy!   

**One Tongue, or Many?**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_"The whole earth was of one language and one speech" (Gen 11:1). In the preceding chapter there is a long list of different tongues or languages, and nations; and it is declared they were "divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, families, and nations." How contradictory!_|

**Joshua Stops the Sun**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Fohi of China had the sun stopped eight hundred and fifty years before Joshua, the son of Nun, ever saw the sun. Bacchus and other God-Men of Egypt had it stopped four times. While in Greece Phaeton was set after it to hurry it up, and increase its speed...The Chinese annals state that the sun stopped ten days during the reign of the Emperor Yom. Arjuna of India stopped it several days for his own accommodation._  <br>  <br>_Yahweh killed more enemies than Joshua did by throwing huge stones down on them from heaven. The kinds were captured hiding in a cave and executed by Joshua. To endorse this story, the author tells us that five of these large stones are laid at the entrance of the cave 'to this day'_  - Thomas L. Thompson (_The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel_)|

**The Miracles of the Bible**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Almost the only evidence we have in any case of the actual performance of a miracle is the report of the writer who relates it....There is not a miracle related in either the Old or New Testament that has not a parallel reported in the Bibles or sacred writings of the Orientalists._|
**Great Exodus of the Chosen**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_We are told that Moses gave notice to the children of Israel at midnight, that they must take their departure from Egypt the next morning for the promised land -_ (See Exodus 12)  <br>  <br>_...if they constituted the immense number represented, they would have made a column two hundred miles long, arranging the five abreast, and it would have taken several days for all to get started. How, then, could they all start the next morning? And how did they keep their two millions of sheep and cattle alive for several days while passing over a sandy desert two poor to produce dog-fennel? And it is strange how the whole tribe of Israelites, if two millions in number, could live forty years in a wild, barren desert, and keep their immense flocks and herds alive._  <br>  <br>_The most wonderful part of this miracle, perhaps, is that 3,000,000 of persons, with a prodigious quantity of cattle, baggage, etc, were able to cross the sea in six hours_ - Arthur Dyott Thompson (_On Mankind: Their Origins and Destiny_)|

**Amazing Increase of the Israelite Race**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The number of first-born male children over a month old, on a certain occasion, is set down at twenty-two thousand two hundred and ninety-three, which would make about eighty-eight children for each mother. This was "replenishing" rapidly...Dan, in the first generation, had but one son (Gen16:22), yet in the fourth generation he had increased to sixty-two thousand seven hundred, or according to Numbers 26:43, to sixty-four thousand, which would have required each son and grandson to have had about eighty children apiece._|

Yes, an amazing increase indeed. But this kind of account shows us not only how loosely numbers were thrown around, but how ignorant the writers of the spurious accounts were in regards simple mathematics and geography. This kind of account adds credence to those scholars who believe the Israelites to have never existed. The various accounts were hurriedly compiled centuries after the events related were said to have occurred. And we can now go so far as to doubt the events themselves, as well as doubt the idiotic accounts that millions still believe have historical veracity. There is no veracity to an Israelite tribe, for as Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Conor MacDari and Kersey Graves have shown, the original "Hebrews" were Celtic Magi from Ireland and not a race of people from the Middle East. Lately the question of the veracity of the Israelites has been highlighted by investigators such as Moustafa Gadalla, Ahmed Osman and Ralph Ellis. These investigators find consensus in one particular area, that concerning the lack of historical veracity of Bible's accounts. Though their theories differ from one another they each make better sense than anything afforded us by clerics and Biblical advocates down through the millennia.  
  
**Second Passover Feeding Frenzy**  
When Moses and the so-called "Children of Israel" were in the desert for forty years, Moses was required to provide for their needs. This was especially the case during the festivals of Passover, that commemorated the release from Egyptian bondage.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_At the second Passover, and offering had to be made for every family (Exod 12), which would require the slaughter of about one hundred and fifty thousand lambs. The three priests had to sprinkle the blood of these lambs; and it had to be done in about two hours (Chron 30:35). The lambs had to be sacrificed at the rate of about one thousand two hundred and fifty a minute, and each priest had to sprinkle the blood of more than four hundred lambs per minute with their own hands, which would make the affair rather a bloody business._|

**Israelites Massacre and Rape Midianites**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...we should have to believe twelve thousand Israelites, in a war with the Midianites, after selecting out thirty-two thousand young damsels, killed forty-eight thousand men, eighty thousand women, and twenty-thousand boys; burned all their cities, and captured all their stock, amounting to eight hundred and eight thousand, and all this without the loss of a single man._|

**Castrating Enemies**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines...Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife -_ (1 Sam. 18:25-27)  <br>  <br>_Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon_ - (Isaiah 39: 6-7)|

**Warm, Compassionate Phinehas**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The story of Numbers tells how, after Israel had been locked in combat with the tribes of Moab and Midian, a number of Israelites began "to commit whoredom"...with Moabite women...This, it is said, angered the Lord...Then "one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the people of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. And when Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the Priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand, and he went after the man of Israel into the tent (tabernacle), and thus thrust both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman_ - Ahmed Osman (_Christianity: An Ancient Egyptian Religion_)|

**Stoning Rebellious Children**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_By the Law of Moses and the will of God, as is claimed, parents were required to stone rebellious children to death; and yet the parents were often the cause of this rebellion disposition, and tenfold more guilty than the children, having corrupted them by bad influences._|

**Israelites, Useless Builders**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_It is stated that it took one hundred and fifty-three thousand men seven years to build Solomon's Temple (2 Chron 2:17-18). Strange, indeed, when it was only a hundred and ten feet long, thirty-six feet wide, and fifty-five feet high (1 Kings 6:2)_|

Compare this with the Egyptian people who could have build a few cities in this time period. The Egyptians are known to have moved entire massive temples a few centimeters in order to maintain their astronomical alignments. Certain temples in Egypt and in Greece are known to have been taken down and moved ever so lightly and then re-constructed from the ground up; and some of these sites had foundation layers made of such massive and heavy blocks that it is a total mystery as to how the re-alignments were made. The famous Phoenician constructed "Baalbeck Stone," in the Lebanon, weighs 1000 tons and was originally upright.  

**Other Gods, Worthier of Worship**  
We have the prophets themselves giving credence to the existence of other gods. We do not need to look further than the scriptures and Gospels themselves to find proof that other gods exist other than the jealous god Jehovah. Does not the Jethro say: Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all Gods. (See Exod18:11)  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_He frequently scolded and punished them for worshiping other gods - a circumstance which furnishes evidence that other gods were better, and therefore more worthy of being worshiped. What else could have caused them to prefer other gods? He should have acted in such a loving and fatherly manner that other gods would not have been so often vexed, harassed, and perplexed at the idolatrous proclivities of his worshipers, and so often resorted to retaliation by forsaking them, selling them, enslaving them, or delivering them into the hands of the spoiler_|

**Preferential Conspiring Yahweh**  
It appears very clear that this Biblical Yahweh is a god only for the Judites, the "Chosen Ones." He is not a god of all. His to be prophet Moses is chosen even though he is a murderer. We are told that he murdered an Egyptian soldier who was beating a "Hebrew." Because of his violent, reckless and immoral deed, Moses was on the run from the Pharaoh who, it seems, personally wanted to kill him. It is during his flight that he comes upon the burning bush and becomes the savior of the "enslaved." Strangely, Moses has to ask who this god is who is addressing him, since he has no idea who Yahweh is. One would think that a Jew about to be exalted by god, and one of the "Chosen People," would know who his own god was. But what of the murdered Egyptian? Was he not a human being and one of God's Chosen? Why is Moses not penalized or sent to Purgatory or Hell? Why is he let off the hook? If all life is sacred and if the high ethics of Judaism are truly non-negotiable then how come we hear nothing more about Moses' murderous deeds, and the after-affects. How is it that we hear no remonstration from Yahweh about the slaughter of the Philistines, Amelikites, Midianites or Canaanites or the dead first-born among the Egyptians? No, we hear of no lament, sorrow, or remonstration from this merciless god. On the contrary, it is this demonic "god," this fuming, tyrannical, sadistic, megalomaniacal Yahweh, who orders all these atrocities to occur. He punishes his servants for not obeying his cruel commands.  
  
**Nature of the "Chosen People"**  
From a cool-headed observation of the accounts that give insight into the behavior of the Jewish "Chosen Ones," we can see just how primitive they were. Their behavior leads us to believe, along with the most astute investigators, that they were indeed uncivilized wanderers without their own settlements, homes, or cities. Their behavior and habits towards nature, animals, and diet, toward their own king, toward children, women and foreigners, openly betrays this fact. The behavior of the Jews which caused antipathy even among their own "Prophets" reveals that they knew nothing of the customs and morals that were known to civilized city peoples. When we compare this stock to the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Celts, Romans, Chaldeans, Gauls, Goths, Teutons and Etruscans, to the Brahmins and Chinese and even to the Native American Indians, we get a clear picture of the kind of people we are told to believe were Yahweh's "Chosen." Their own King David declared: There is none righteous: no, not one. Jesus called them: A generation of vipers.  
  
Their own prophet Isaiah (who himself traveled through Egypt and Ethiopia stark naked, see Isaiah 20:3), says of his own people:           

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Their hands are defiled with blood, and their fingers with iniquity; and their lips speak lies; their tongues mutter perverseness. None of them call for justice; none of the plead for truth. They trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hand. Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.  <br>  <br>The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink. They are swallowed up of wine, They are out of the way through strong drink. They err in vision, They stumble in judgment._|

**Rev. Hilliard said of them:**   

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_They were by nature, perhaps, the most cruel and blood-thirsty, as well as idolatrous, people in this world._ _Dr. Burnet (a Christian writer), in his book Archaelologia Philosophie says: They were of a gross and sluggish nature, not qualified for the contemplation of natural things, nor the perception of divine ones. And consequently, Moses provided nothing for them of an intellectual nature, and promised them nothing beyond this life..." Lactantius says: They were never visited by the learned men of other countries, because they were never famous for literature. St. Cyril says: Moses never attempted to philosophize with the Jews, because they were 'grossly ignorant' and addicted to idolatry. Dr. Burnet also says of them:_ _They were depraved in all their manners and discipline, and almost bereaved of humanity. If I may speak the truth...they were a vile company of men - and assembly of slaves brought out of Egypt...who understood no art but that of making bricks._|

And most of these testimonials come from their own prophets and supportive biographers. We can see that they were not worthy of much praise, but they could certainly be useful to the Church later formed in their name, a church that could plant upon them names and titles that did not belong there; a church that could fix upon such rootless people a sublime religion originating elsewhere, in the far western hemisphere of the world. We can empty our finest mansions and sell off the furniture to later find it in the slums of vagabonds and derelicts. The specimen who finds it hard to sit upon a Louis XIV chair is hardly the same specimen who made it. And yet this is akin to that which we are meant to ingest by the Judeo-Christian hoaxers, in regards matters of Biblical history. From all that we read from such sources, it appears sensible to agree with Graves when he summarizes the dilemma:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Some of the laws which Moses adopted for the government of the Jews corroborates still further the statement that they occupied a very low position in the scale of morals as well as intellect; for the laws of a nation are a true standard of their character. Hence the law of Moses prohibiting uncleanliness (Lev 15), the law against incest (Lev 18). Laws against bestiality, to prohibit both sexes from carnal familiarity with beasts, and various other laws of a similar character, furnish a clear implication that they were addicted to all these vile habits; and a law to compel them to wash their hands leads to the conclusion that they were inclined to be filthy in their habits._|

We might add, in light of these revelations, how unlikely it is that this nation of Jews spent any time in Egypt. It is less likely that they, as scholars like Ralph Ellis insist, were Pharaohs in the land of Egypt. This supposition hardly gels well with the facts regarding their despicable moral and physical nature. At least we must remain suspicious of any modern investigator who insists that the Israelites were elites in Egyptian society. This thesis is getting more and more acceptance of late, and comes to us with its own inconsistencies and errors. (These matters will be dealt with in other works by this author).  
  
**Did They Even Exist?**  
It is not hard to build a case for the non-existence of the so-called Israelite race. And it is even less difficult to build a case for their depravity, given that they did exist. If we are looking for evidence showing how primitive, superstitious, lawless, moral-less, covetous, genocidal, murderous, and maniacal was this tribe, we need look only to their own works and to the accounts of historians who wrote about them. Only a depraved soul can imagine or consider that these entities are identical with the Arch-Magi of Egypt and Ireland, or are the same persons as those who preserved the secrets of the cosmos, the religious elite of ancient times who lived in harmony with flora and fauna and who practiced the highest and noblest sciences. The entities spoken of in these Biblical chapters are hardly identical with those who were in the habit of musing on the deepest matters of philosophy and metaphysics. That millions in the world have convinced themselves otherwise is not strange to us when we realize from what churches and colleges they have received their "knowledge" of history. What kind of minds would be drawn to revere such a perverse god? Clearly, it is similarly depraved souls that seek to identify with the personalities of Christianity’s gruesome scriptures. Although most people will not consciously condone the accounts of blood-lust and vengeance, etc, we cannot avoid suspecting the presence of unconscious drives that find attraction to such deeds. Indoctrination aside, we must ask what other reason could there be that would make any man or woman humble their dignity before a Church and a book built on such perfidy? We might be astonished at the answer.  

**Character of Abraham**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Abraham's conduct towards his servant-girl Hagar is both disgraceful and inhuman, as he first destroyed her character and virtue by criminal intimacy, and then turned her and her child into the wilderness to starve (Gen 21)...And this is the man who is represented as being chosen by a God of infinite wisdom, infinite purity, and infinite holiness, to stand at the head of the moral regeneration and salvation of this whole human race._|

**Abraham - Liar Extraordinaire**  
When Abraham and Sarah, having traveled something like 700 miles across Canaan, get to Egypt the very first thing that they do is lie to the ruling Pharaoh. In the preposterous concocted story Abraham appears a deceiver of great proportion and anything but a man of god. He lies to Pharaoh and makes Sarah out to be his sister rather than his wife. The Pharaoh then marries Sarah and only complains when great plagues fall upon Egypt. Pharaoh suspects something is wrong, that he has offended the gods, and confronts Abraham who then admits that he deceived the king. Now, this is the first crime perpetuated the Bible (after Adam's sin) and suggestively, as we can see, it is perpetrated upon the Jews but committed by one of them. Abraham does the lying and deceiving, not the Egyptian Pharaoh. This cheater made himself fat and rich, and was awarded status and protection in Egypt because of his cunning. What kind of man would do this kind of thing without remorse or hesitation? It is more than suggestive, therefore, that the first son born of the primal parents, Cain, should turn out to be a murderer and that the first Patriarch of the Jews should be a immoral, cunning, lying, reckless, and self-aggrandizing criminal. (See Genesis 12:18, for the Biblical account).  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Bible dates are so far off that no rational person can take them seriously…Terah, Joseph’s great great grandfather, was seventy when his son Abram was born. Terah, we are later told, died at the age of two hundred and five. Astonishingly, a few biblical verses later we learn that Abram was seventy-five when his father died, when according to biblical calculations, Abram should have been one hundred and twenty-five years old and not seventy-five_ - Moustafa Gadalla (_Historical Deception_)|

**Abraham Sacrificing His Son**  
Whether it was his actual first-born son, or just that one born from a lesser wife, it appears an that Abraham is all to willing to submit to the depraved will of his Lord, and does not stand and question why this deed should need to be done. Again, we find that obedience is what turns the Lord on, not free-will or independence. And why would an all-knowing god need to check the faith of one of his mortal servants. Does this not imply ignorance on the part of the Lord concerning the actions of his creations. "Now I know that thou fearest god," says Jehovah to Abraham, after the wicked experiment is concluded.  
  
**Laban, Master of Treachery and Deceit**  
Jacob has to hide out from the wrath of his brother Esau, and does so far away from home. He visits his strange and possibly insane uncle Laban, and meets his future wife Rachel there. However, his ungracious uncle makes Jacob jump through some major hoops in order to win his daughter.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The proneness of the Lord's holy people to falsify, cheat and deceive is well illustrated in the case of Laban, who, after Jacob had, by a fair contract, labored seven years for him for his daughter Rachel, would not let him have her, but forced his older daughter Leah upon him; and, when Jacob complained, he told him he must serve seven years more if he got Rachel; and his love for her prompted him to accept the terms. But he seems not to have been well compensated for his fourteen long years of toil for these two sisters._|

Obviously, this story has not a modicum of truth. Still, it is believed by millions of people and millions of scholars and experts. The fact that there is not a iota of sense, logic or plausibility in it, has not troubled those who have lives without sense, logic, or plausibility. "You are what you eat," goes the saying. "You are what you believe" can be its substitute.  
  
**David - The Despot, Ingrate, Seducer, and Mass Murderer**  
It's a case of will the real David please stand up. We don't have one David but two. We don't have one time period in which he lived but two, and they are 500 years apart. 

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The task of identifying the historical David is complicated from the outset by the fact that the Old Testament provides us with two contrasting Davidic characters who cannot have been the same person...Scholars have largely chosen, despite the lack of any genealogical link between him and the start of the Christian era, to identify this tribal chief as King David, who is presented to us in a number of guises - shepherd; rival to Saul and later Ishbosheth, one of Saul's surviving sons; for the Israelite leadership; an accomplished harpist; "a man of war;" slayer of Goliath in an epic duel; and a coward who fled from the wrath of his son, Absalom_ _-_ Ahmed Osman (_Christianity: An Ancient Egyptian Religion_)|

**David - Old Lecher and Seducer**  
The Book of Kings opens with a remarkable scene. Remarkable for its pornographic features that is:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king  -_ (1 Kings 1)|

**David - The Rapist**  
David and his armies are fighting at Jerusalem. David spots the lovely Bathsheba, the wife of one of his chief warriors, a Hittite called Uriah. Behind Uriah's back, this great king, gets his guards to bring Bathsheba, another man's wife, to him so he can seduce her. Bathsheba becomes pregnant as a result of David's fornicating attentions. David then has his guards position Uriah in the front of the battle so that he might be slain. In the Book of Samuel, we read:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle...that he may be smitten and die -_ (Samuel 11:15)|

What a decent, loving, god-inspired king, was the good David. A man who sends his great allies to be slaughtered by enemies after raping their wives. And many a modern writer (Gadalla, Osman, Ellis, Gardner, etc,) speculate that this David was the same personage as the great Egyptian Pharaoh Tuthmosis III, grand warrior king of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Are we to believe that the greatest Pharaohs of Egypt acted in such a despicable manner? It seems so. David could not murder Uriah at Jerusalem because the soldier did not want to remain in comfort while his troops were suffering hardship in the fields of battle. This is why David had him positioned at the most dangerous locales of the battle instead. Here we see the brutal conniving character of the "chosen" ones of Yahweh, a brutal and conniving god.  
  
**David and Goliath**  
In fact, like the vast majority of the Bible's hodgepodge, the David and Goliath tale was a blatant plagiarism. It was taken from an Egyptian tale, very well known in antiquity, entitled The Autobiography of Sinuhe, which spoke of deeds that occurred thousands of years in the past. It is Sinuhe, not David, who travels and does battle with a strange giant. But the Israelite scribes of later ages believed that few would remember the Egyptian original, and did not mind re-scripting the tale to aggrandize their own hero. No matter that it was among the favorite morality tales of the Egyptians for millennia. So, in light of this, if we take away the stories of the "biographical" David, we are not left with much of a biography. No, we are not left with a David. And the same rule applies across the board, when it comes to the dramatis personae of the Bible.  
  
Fictional or biographical, there is barely a thing that this Judaic David did that was not immoral in the extreme. But we are not given these stories in Sunday School. We hear the edited accounts, that suit the fiction being manufactured for our sullied palates.

||_One of his first acts of moral delinquency was that of turning traitor to Achish, King of Gath. After the king had kindly given him a rulership over the city of Ziklag, he manifested his ingratitude by waging an unprovoked war for plunder upon the king's friends and relatives, to rob them of their cattle_ _(1 Samuel27)._  <br>  <br>_The manner in which David obtained his first wife Michal is shocking to all who possess kind and philanthropic feelings. Saul had proposed a hundred foreskins of the Philistines as the price of his daughter; but David, in wanton cruelty, killed two hundred for this purpose. The manner in which David obtained his beautiful wife Bathsheba, to add to his list of wives, might be tolerated in that era of barbarism; but it must be looked upon at the present time as an act of cruelty and wickedness.  <br>  <br>David's murder of five step-sons and two brothers-in-law, to gratify a malignant grudge toward the House of Saul, is another act showing the fiendish character of the man...David's advice to his son Solomon, on his death-bed, to assassinate Joab and his other enemies, shows that his ruling passions - animosity and revenge - were strong in death. And finally, David's wicked prayer, as found in the 109th Psalm, in which he invokes a series of the most horrid curses upon his enemies, culminates his immoral history._|

**The Character of Solomon**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Solomon's writings and history both show that he was a libertine, a tyrant, and a polygamist. His tyrannical monopoly of seven hundred wives and three hundred prostitutes, making him a practical "Free-Lover" on a large scale, is an indelible stigma upon his character._|

**Character of Elisha**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_For the simple, childish though rude, act of calling him "bald-head" we are told he caused "two bears to come out of the woods, and tear forty-two of them to pieces."_|

**Character of Jael, Wife of Heber**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_We read that as a poor fugitive by the name Sisera was fleeing from "the Lord's holy people" who were pursuing him with uplifted swords...Jael went out to meet him (Sisera), and said unto him, "Turn in, my lord, turn into me. Fear not." And when he had turned in unto her in the tent, she covered him with a mantle, and feigned much pity for him; and, when he had fallen asleep, "she took a nail of the tent and a hammer, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temple, and fastened it into the ground"...And yet Jehovah, the god of Israel, is represented as saying, "Blessed above women shall Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be." (Judg 5:24)_|

**Character of Constantine - God's Prime Minister**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_When the "Christian" emperor, Constantine, had murdered his wife, son, nephew, and several other relatives, he raised his hands toward heaven, and exclaimed, "The blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin." Here is an example of the pernicious and demoralizing effect of the Christian doctrines of atonement and forgiveness._|

Today such a god would be declared a fascist, or a racist, or a bigot, and would be considered a pariah. But in the world of the Israelites, such a god was worthy of veneration. We can add here, that these stipulations against physical imperfection would be explainable if the god in question was physical in nature, and was involved in some kind of genetic experimentation. For those who think this statement to be contentious and preposterous, we can only repeat Conan Doyle's motto: When one has excluded the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.  
  
**Character of Paul**  
It would take a volume to elucidate the perfidy of the nature of this creator of the Cult of Jesus.

||_If any man preach any other doctrine than that which I declare unto you, let him be accursed (1 Gal 1:9)_  <br>  <br>_I suffer not a woman to speak in church (1 Cor 14:35)  <br>  <br>It is a shame for a woman to speak in the church_|

**Jehovah Punishes the Egyptians**  
Among the vast index of crimes of this depraved god, the one which stands out concerns the treatment of the Egyptian people during the time of the Exodus. We are told that Jehovah needs Moses to secure the release of the "Chosen People," but that he "hardens Pharaoh's heart" in order to prevent their easy release. He also reins down all manner of plagues upon the innocent, slaying thousands who could not in any way be implicated in any crime against the Israelites.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...Jehovah is represented as killing all the first-born of all Egyptian parents without any distinction of character, or any regard to their innocence; and even the first-born beasts also. In the name of justice and mercy, what sin had the beasts committed that they had to be punished?...And it seems strange that Pharaoh should have horses enough for six hundred "chosen chariots" (Exod 14:7) after they had all been killed three of four times by some of the plagues..._|

**Egypt Flooded**  
Egypt Flooded Genesis 7:20 tells us that the waters rose 60 feet above the mountain tops, with some of the mountains being over 6 miles high. The waters covered Egypt six miles deep. This is told to us, even though there is not enough water on earth to accomplish this, and even if it did exist, it would have taken Egypt, along with the rest of the world, centuries to recover.          
  
**Love Thy Neighbor**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_The Lord kept his people pure, holy and upright through every period of their history -_ (Christian historian)|

Cain murdered his brother Abel; David killed Uriah; Judith cut off the head of Holofernes while in bed with him; Jeholada, the priest, murdered his queen; Jael murdered Sisera by driving nail through his head as he slept; Ehud murdered the king of Eglon under the guise of friendship; Absalom murdered Ammon; Joab murdered Absalom; Solomon murdered his brother Adonijah; Baasha murdered Nadab, Zimri murdered Elah, Omri murdered Zimri, Ahab murdered Naboth; Jehu murdered Ahab and Joram; Shallum murdered Zachariah, Hoshea murdered Pekah, the 11 sons of Jacob attempt to murder their brother Joseph, Judas sells out Jesus to his enemies for profit. 30,000 Midianites were slaughtered by Moses. Philistines were massacred by David. The list goes on...  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_We can not wonder, therefore, that Christian Bible believers, who have chosen this book as "the supreme rule of their conduct" should have written their history in blood, and that the whole pathway of their pilgrimage is strewn with the bones of their murdered victims, who were slain for being true to their consciences, and for believing in and worshiping God according to their convictions or right and duty._|

**God's Preferences and Prejudices**  
The god of love and mercy delivers to his prophet Moses injunctions against who can be accepted in his presence. After reading through the criteria for entry into gods presence we might wonder how a Socrates, with his deranged features, would have faired. Like poor blind Homer, he would have been debarred from the temple of Jehovah on account of his unseemly appearance.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_He says "The Lord spake unto Moses" and told him that no person with a flat nose or crooked back or broken hand, a crooked eye, or who was lame or possessing any kind of physical blemish, should be admitted into the congregation of the Lord (Lev 21)_|

**Miracles of the Lord's Prophets**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Ezekiel, we are told, lay three hundred and ninety days on his left side, and forty days on his right side; and then, having swallowed a roll of parchment with the aid of Jehovah, he was prepared for business...Jeremiah wore cords around his neck, and a yoke on his back...Hosea claimed that God commanded him twice to go marry a whore (Hos 1:2)...Ezekiel relates a "story" about being carried by "the hand of the Lord," and set down among some old dry bones, which he proceeded to invest with human flesh and sinews, and then drew skins over them to hold the flesh and bones together (Ezek 37). Here is a story that casts all the wild and weird tales of heathen mythology in the shade._|

Right! This is the precise truth and main point. The idea of these fiction-weavers was to do just that, to outshine the other heathen religions of the world, which meant attempting to beat them at their own game. Certainly, this desire is a far cry from the attempt to convert sane people by sane means of philosophy and reasoning. So, lets admit this and have done with the ambiguity. Lets take these scriptures for the cartoons they are and waste no more energy searching for their redeeming qualities. Are there not other works in this world from the minds of excellent savants, free-thinkers, critics, poets and visionaries, that are worth our time and consideration. Naturally, the answer is in the affirmative. So, why do we not pay them heed and cleave so ardently to the Bible and its spurious fables? We cannot hope to answer such a question without the most inquiring investigation into the psyche of human beings. We would have to spend our time delving into hidden impulses and motives, into the fundamental emotional drives of human beings, and would have to investigate the hemispheres of the human personality, and become acquainted with the manifold compulsions and complexes of the unconscious mind. We would, after such an in-depth investigation, understand man to be a rather existentially frail and fragile creature, full of fear and anxiety, divorced from his center, outer-directed and raging within from all manner of unfulfilled fantasies and desires. We would find him to be the victim of sadism toward himself, and would conclude that his hatred of his own self leads him to perpetrate untold cruelty toward others. We would see that he is not whole within, and that his ego cannot stand aloneness or silence. We would discover that the modern mind is still plagued with ancient fears, and that its morality is but a veneer, a compromise struck with the equally immoral world in which it must exist. We would then understand why such an unhygienic psyche would be attracted to the God of Christianity, and to the lifestyle that comes pre-packaged to him from the authorities who regard him with contempt. Yes, lacking in internal authority, our human creature turns to external representatives to be guided and directed, and also to be chastised for his moral misdemeanors. All the while, the infirm soul does not realize that the god he worships is nothing more or less than a projection of his own diseased consciousness, with all the inflated proclivities that he himself has festering within his being. Out of such a psychic miasma, man crawls forth eagerly toward the priest and the "theology" that tells him how a good god lies behind his every good deed, and how a devil hides behind his every evil deed. "Hallelujah! - peace at last!" cries our good Christian, "all is explained!"

**Question of "Graven Images"**  
There is no greater sin for Christians than idolatry. It is considered worse than murder in the Bible. So important was it that the prohibition, that is found in the Ten Commandments, can be found before that which says "Thou Shalt Not Kill." For all the rhetoric, there is not much sanity in the prohibition.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...can it be more sinful to make an image of him with the hand than with the head? In other words, to construct a likeness of him externally, than to construct it internally? Certainly not. One is shaped out in the mind, the other is shaped out of a block of wood or metal, and most certainly, if the latter is idolatry, the former is also. The Christian kneels in supplication with the image of God set up in his mind; the pagan worships with the image set up in the temple or on the altar. One is externally represented with words; the other with wood. The only difference between the Christian and pagan idolatry is, that, after each has sketched out a likeness of the Creator upon the tablet or dial-plate of his mind...the Christian stops short with his work but half-completed, while the pagan goes on and given practical expression to his by representing it with wood, stone, or other material..._|

So, we see the problem in a rational light and uncover yet more insanity in the Christian world. Yet, we must still seek an answer for this strange and seemingly idiotic prohibition. We suspect that other gods were not to be depicted, but also that man was not to use his senses, and his imagination. Man was to obey, and labor, not partake in creation of his own. Creativity was for the pagans. The Christian was not to produce artwork, was not to carve, paint, fashion, sculpt, or give physical expression to his thoughts. He was to ever be repressed, inward, stultified, conservative and morose. Let us remember the cost of obedience to this edict. The Christian world is one without Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Dali or Cezanne. Jehovah casts into his hell Van Gogh, Dante Rossetti and William Blake, and all those children who have dared to draw with crayon and paint-box. Still, we know that the Church could not endure without their pictorialization of scripture. They tried it an found out that the human mind did not suffer such a void. So, they were compelled by necessity to revive and endorse figurative representation. Suddenly, we have the bearded and non-bearded Jesus, and Mary the Madonna; and the disciples at the table of the Last Supper, and pictures of every event in the Bible. We have the medieval painters, the Renaissance Masters, and finally the epic movie-makers such as Cecil B. DeMille - idolaters all, but with sanction from the Pope.  
  
We might muse that Christians are the greatest idolaters of all, since unlike the Jews they worship three gods instead of one: The Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit. They are idolatrous in their open veneration of a physical book, namely the Bible itself. Is it not a physical item that has commanded worship, in the selfsame manner as any pagan statue or site?  
  
**The Book of Nature**  
Would man not naturally learn all that he was meant to learn from a natural impulse to do so? Would he not strive to question the meaning of life, even if a holy book did not exist purporting to have all his answers? Are we to believe that without the Bible, man is worse off in his intellectual development? Clearly, a rational person can see that man would be far better off without such a book. But those who refute this point are those who believe that man, left to his own nature, is an ignorant, recalcitrant primitive who can never aspire to morality or sanctity of his own nature. Those who believe this consider Nature herself to be a sorry teacher, unimpressive and dismal enough to never inspire man to wonder and awe. How pessimistic and bleak is this philosophy?   

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_There is not a moral or religious duty that is not inscribed on the tablet of man's soul or consciousness which he would not soon learn if his attention were not constantly directed to, and his mind occupied with, the erroneous theories of the dark illiterate ages...the mind that could comprehend a truth revealed from God, could originate it without the aid of revelation. Hence revelation would be worse than useless, as it would furnish a pretext for mental or intellectual sloth, and thus have a tendency to stop human progress by doing for us what we could and should do ourselves._|

Additionally, are the Jew and the Christian the only ones who are, by way of their supposed divine privilege, capable of creating works of meaning to stir the heart, and mind, and to inspire the world? The Bible would suggest yes, whereas sanity and reason suggests no. The Egyptian's were not Christians, as we would recognize in today's world, yet they surpassed every other nation in craft. Atheists and agnostics have composed the world's finest poetry (Shelley, Swinburne, Rimbaud, Blake, Larkin, Pound, Baudelaire, Lord Byron and Wordsworth, etc), the most philosophical and moving plays and novels (D. H. Lawrence, Emily Bronte, Thomas Hardy, James Joyce, Ibsen, etc), the world's greatest symphonies (Beethoven, Mahler), the loveliest canvases and sculpture (Van Gogh, Dali, Matisse, Cocteau, Gauguin, Pisarro, Rodin, etc), and the deepest humanistic philosophy (Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Hume, Kant, Avicenna, and Rousseau, etc). Have the Moslems and Moghuls not produced works of art, poetry and philosophy to rival and even far surpass the Jew or Christian? Where the Moors not the ones preserving the works of the Classical Age, and where they not the ones erecting the first modern universities of Persia (Gundishapur) and of Spain (Cordova, Bologna and Seville?). Are we to mock with bigotry the exquisite creativity of Hafiz, Jalaluddin Rumi, Omar Khayyam, Kahlil Gibran, Rabindranath Tagore, Shams-i-Tabriz, Kabir, and Bulleh Shah, or defame Chuang Tzu, Lao Tsu, Tu Fu, and Confucius, because they were not prostrate before the altar of Jehovah?  
  
Alternatively, there are Christians who have brought terror, mayhem and calamity to the world, who have massacred whole tribal groups and indigenous nations, and who have tortured their victims in blood-soaked dungeons, who have slaughtered women, men and children in the name of their lord, and who wage war the world over. So, let us dispense with reverence for those who wave Bibles at us, as if theirs was the whole truth and only beauty.  
  
**The Cult of Forgiveness**  
This one should have gone the way of Indulgences. Put before us as a great Christian virtue, forgiveness has within it hidden dangers not addressed in the holy, holy scriptures. It is not the great and honorable thing that it appears to be. To forgive is to harm oneself, and to go against the dictates of reason. A man cannot forgive another, and it is not his province to do so. He can only forgive himself within his own heart. Waiting for others to forgive us is a form of slavery to the emotions of others, one from which we may never be freed. Moreover, as Graves warns us, it spurs man on to even more injustice. In short, the only persons interested in the potentials of forgiveness, are those given to excessive sin, such as those wearing the robes and crowns, holding the keys to the seminaries and churches of the world.

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_When the "Christian" emperor, Constantine, had murdered his wife, son, nephew, and several other relatives, he raised his hands toward heaven, and exclaimed, "The blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin." Here is an example of the pernicious and demoralizing effect of the Christian doctrines of atonement and forgiveness.  <br>  <br>A little reflection must convince any unbiased mind that, while men and women are taught to believe that the consequences of sin or crime can be arrested or mitigated by an act of forgiveness by the divine Law-Maker, they will feel the less restrained from the commission of crime and wickedness. They naturally look upon it as a sort of license for the indulgence of their passions and propensities...An act of forgiveness implies that the legitimate consequences of the evil deed or sinful act can be set aside, and escaped...Scientifically speaking, the law is the cause and the penalty the effect.  <br>  <br>The clergy tell the most vile and debauched villain and bloody assassin, after he has inhumanly butchered and murdered his innocent and virtuous wife, can, by an act of repentance and forgiveness, swing from the end of the hangman's rope directly into a heaven of pure and unalloyed bliss, and, with his fingers all dripping with human blood, join the white-robed saints..._|

**Jehovah - The Author of Evil**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good -_ (Jeremiah 18:11)|

Passages exist in the Bible proving that Jehovah is the sole author of the evil in the world. For instance, in Isaiah 45:7, God says "I create evil." And in Amos 3:6, Amos is asked "Shall there be evil in a city and the Lord hath not done it." And in Jeremiah 18:11, we read: "I frame evil against you."  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_If "God made everything that was made" then he either made evil or the author of evil, whether that was the Devil of a serpent or a fallen angel; and this is substantially the same thing as originating evil - to originate the author of evil._|

**When Was Jesus Born?**  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_Matthew lists twenty-eight generations from David to Jesus, while Luke tabulates forty-three. According to John Jesus visited Jerusalem at least four times, but the Synoptics (Mark, Luke and Matthew) assure is that he journeyed to that city only once. As to the length of Jesus’ ministry the Synoptics say one year, but John says at least 3 years. From the Synoptical account, we gather that the savior carried out his work chiefly in Galilee. But John informs us that Judea was the principle theatre of the ministry of Christ_ - John G. Jackson (_Pagan Origins of the Jesus Myth_)|

MAJOR BIBLICAL CONTRADICTIONS  

In this section we present a short list of major Biblical contradictions noticed by scholar Kersey Graves, and delineated in his book _Bible of Bibles_. The interested reader is directed to this fine work, as well as to the previously penned _The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors_.  
  
We go to this labor willingly since we cannot hesitate to warn our readers concerning the Bible's outrageously contorted philosophy. This is, after all, a book in which we find mornings and evenings created before the sun, in which sons are two years older than the fathers who give them birth (see Chron 21:20), in which asses can talk and prophesize, and in which god hires his enemy Satan to tempt and then torment the most devoted amongst his believers. It is a book in which the "biographers" of Jesus cannot even agree as to the time of his crucifixion, at which they were present. In short, we need not bother ourselves separating "sheep from goats," just the rational from the irrational. Such a distinction is necessary in this world since it appears that many of the latter sort command the ships of state and hold high office in the lands and since, even in our midst, we must encounter proselytizers, advocates and adherents of this garbled oriental lore that commands so much allegiance and veneration. Indeed, we can declare the Bible to be one of the most useful books in the world, given that it provides us an excellent gauge separating, not believers from unbelievers, but the sane from the unsane.

Problems With Biblical Interpretation  

|   |   |
|---|---|
||_...its chronology is unreliable, chimerical, and incorrect; its history contradictory and incredible; its philosophy fallacious; its logic unsound; its cosmology foolish and absurd, its astronomy fragmentary and childish; its religion pagan-derived, its morals defective, sometimes selfish, often extravagant, and in some cases pernicious...It is often dark, ambiguous, and mysterious, as well as contradictory, not only in its lessons on morality, but in its account of the simplest occurrences, this rendering it comparatively worthless as a moral guide_ - Kersey Graves (_Bible of Bibles_)|

There are many reasons why it is difficult to take the Bible's tales and stories as history, or as biography. It is difficult to translate the Bible and it is known that earlier interpreters, scribes, editors and compilers took great liberties with the material at their disposal.  
  
Every personal prejudice was given priority over historical accuracy, and every contortion of original Stellar Theology was given precedence. Every true and accurate reference to the origins of the Christ Story, to the True Natural Religion (of the Egyptians and the Irish Druids) was consciously obscured. But aside from these travesties there are several others to bear in mind. Let us take space to delineate the most obvious and persistent obstacles to interpretation as they affect the Bible and its comprehension, so that we may discover how intricate the web of Christianity is, and why the reason of so many people has become seized, entangled and entrapped in its glimmering but deadly strands.  
  
The Hebrew language does not have clear tenses, and these are almost indecipherable in ancient texts and chronicles. No attempt is made to clearly delineate when an event is meant to have occurred. The most general references and pointers are given most of which turn out, on closer scrutiny, to be wrong. Scholars have difficulty even telling if a thing mentioned, happened in the past. The Book of Isaiah is a clear example of this. As Egyptian scholar and revisionist Ahmed Osman writes...whether Isaiah is writing about the past, present, or future depends upon what interpretation the translator put into his words.  
  
Never, in key Old Testament tales are we given clear references as to which Pharaoh was reigning in Egypt during key events. This persistent omission is a clear indication that the books in question, and the tall tales in them, are compilations of later times. A scribe-historian who actually lived during, or close to, the time when the scripted events were professed to have occurred, would certainly have known the Pharaoh's name and would have stated it with plenty of details about him and his times. This is not too much to ask and is to be expected of any credible historian, of anyone who should be eligible to bear that title. The concoctors of Bible passages are certainly not deserving of the title of "Historian." These same concoctors repeatedly provide excruciating details concerning the most insignificant events and happenings, and labor over meaningless details concerning wells, and trees, and broken down walls, and herds of animals, and all sorts of superfluous nonsense, but pass by the names of reigning pharaohs who are central to their dramas, and who are among the main rivals to the "Chosen People."  
  
There is mention of the work of early historians, such as Manetho, Josephus and other "historians." Yet we find out after some study that we do not possess their original works. We "known of" their works because they were captioned or referenced by later historians that we do know existed. So, it appears that we are to accept the writings of ancient historians because their works are referenced in the works of more recent historians. This is a given in Biblical studies, and the logic of this arbitrary irrational acceptance is rarely questioned. It is unquestioned even when evidence arises that strongly counters centuries of belief, and that disputes the very physical existence of the first breed of historians. However, whether we accept the existence of the early historians or not, we also encounter major problems with their accounts. Some accounts are so preposterous as to not even warrant attention. Others have lapsed from the ranks of credibility as modern science and archaeology expose their innumerable inconsistencies and fallacies.  
  
There are many clearly duplicated stories and accounts throughout the Bible. These are well cataloged. And when they are reviewed objectively they also make us suspicious as to the authenticity of the tale and the credibility of the author.  
  
This leads to yet another important point. We have been conditioned to be inordinately reverent toward the many Bible personalities and toward the supposedly historically existent authors. We are dutifully but illogically respectful toward the Jeremiahs, Josephs, Johns, Pauls and Jeromes, and the rest of the names and figures sanctified by time. This spontaneous reverence also bends the mind of the student and fogs the perspective. We have handled with kid-gloves that that should have been ditched long ago as utterly worthless.  
  
There are thousands of translations of the single work known as the "Holy Bible." Additionally, it is known and recognized by both Gentile and Hebrew scholars that the first translations of the Bible (primarily the "Septuagint" or first Greek translation), are hopelessly flawed and filled with interpolations and mistranslations, many of which appear to be consciously made. One instance concerns the term "Nazareth." Still, to this day, Jesus is said to have come from Nazareth, as if it were a place. However, at no time, and in no place, is there a record of such a locale. It is known to never have existed. Jesus was a "Nazarene" that is, a member of a hard-line sect of Jews. This discrepancy is common knowledge to most scholars and yet the church-men continue to preach the Nazareth fallacy. There are innumerable other such obvious and pernicious discrepancies.
