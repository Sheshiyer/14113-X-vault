| > WHEN you begin to detach from a vampiristic person, or even contemplate doing so, you may find yourself coming under even greater attack. Therefore, it’s important to not let a vampiristic person suspect what you are planning. Remember that an attack constitutes not only a draining of lifeforce, but an act of psychic dumping into your energy field. Consequently, once a vampiristic type realizes that you are attempting to detach from their presence, they will often try to dispose of even more psychic garbage through you. This is not a pleasant experience and can be life-threatening. Sadly, no allopathic therapist has the faintest idea that such a subtle process exists, and very few homeopathic therapists are aware of it. This is a problem, because until a pathological state is correctly understood and diagnosed it cannot be cured. With this in mind, we see that when it comes to psychic attack you are largely on your own. You must call upon your Higher Self in order to persevere and heal. In short, the lessons to be learned from your experiences are not only of a physical type, but of a spiritual nature. Wisdom is the greatest protection against evil, because the soil of evil is ignorance - Mtsar | --- |

|---|The soul, or more correctly the _Self_, is something you create here on earth through life experience. The process involves the patient deconstruction of all falsity, which in turn implies the conscious upgrading of critical skills and judgment.   <br>  <br>Ultimately, although there is no physical meter or gauge for detecting a self-murdered vamp, the instrument we possess to gain this knowledge is _intuition_. A highly developed intuition works like the immune system. It detects and defends against violations of Selfhood. In light of this, we see that the enlightened person – on the road to Selfhood – develops intuitive skill along with rational judgment. They trust in _themselves_, and heed subtle intimations provided by mind _and_ body. This is vital because using one kind of intelligence – namely, that of the intellect – is not enough to ward off evil.  <br>  <br>Understand that the greatest evil is perpetrated upon the virtuous. It exists and occurs primarily due to the compassion and ignorance of good people unaware of how evil works. Therefore develop critical and judgmental skills and doubt everything. Observe how you suffer by projecting your own goodness and virtue on others. Learn how your goodness and compassion enslave you to the will of other people. Goodness without boundary is the soil from which evil grows.  <br>  <br>Understand once and for all that not everyone you meet is “good.” You have no reason to treat people as good and moral until they repeatedly prove it. You are not obliged to like, respect or befriend anyone whether they deserve it or not. Similarly, it is not your job to overtly confront and fix evil. Immoral persons must correct themselves. They don’t need help from you, even if they pretend they do. So be very wary when someone attempts to treat you as their savior. If their attempts to flatter you elicit uncomfortable feelings, there is a reason. Your intuition (or deeper intelligence) is sending out a warning.  <br>  <br>Many vamps own and thumb through books on sociopathy in hopes of enhancing their camouflage. After all, what better way is there for a criminal to disguise their nature than pretend to be a detective? In short, because a person appears knowledgeable about obscure subjects, it does not mean they are to be believed and trusted. Don't merely rely on a person's talk, rather observe their actions.  <br>  <br>Your adversaries are the measure of your inner power. Only the powerful have powerful enemies. Realize, therefore, that you can defeat any adversary that seeks your downfall. No matter how dark the way, the light is there to lead you to safety. If you are unable to see it, it’s not the fault of the light.  <br>  <br>Evil is never defeated with the weapons it deliberately provides its adversaries. Evil people are threatened only by the superior morality and spiritual strength of others. In fact, evil people envy these traits; envy being the root of most human malefaction. Therefore, due to their ambivalent attitude toward virtue, a vampiristic type may for a while choose to be around you simply because you possess traits they lack and wish to study.  <br>  <br>The experiment is doomed from the outset, because the relationship will be one of attraction mixed with repulsion, and because the vamp eventually realizes that virtue is not something they can cheaply purchase and install overnight. In the short term, attraction-repulsion type relationships feel exhilarating and tantalizing. However, over time, repulsion comes to dominate and the vamp seeks to be rid of your troubling presence. Any failure or moral infraction on your part will be blown out of proportion and used to condemn and demean you. Other people will be routinely exalted in order to make you feel crushed and insecure. The more you emphatically attempt to confront, interrogate or correct the vamp, the more they become icy, remote and cruel. They have secretly bookmarked a long list of your would-be infractions to deftly and ruthlessly use against you when the time comes.  <br>  <br>False love enslaves, whereas true love frees. When you think you’re in love, you might be wrong. You might simply be romantically enthralled. You might simply wish to impress mates or ingratiate parents. Watch to see if this “love” you’re in serves to make you wise or foolish in your choices and decisions. Sensitively watch to see if you rise or fall, succeed or fail, feel healthy or unhealthy while “in love.” Do you drive away good friends or win more of them to your side? Do you receive lucky breaks or less of them?  <br>  <br>Learn to monitor your emotional moods and states and how they change when in the company of other people. This ability makes you immune against psychic attack. Whenever you feel odd, discombobulated or unwell, immediately and willfully ask “…is this energy coming from me or from some other person?” Be sure to heed the answer and act accordingly. Be sure to bar negative energy from your being and send it back to its origin.  <br>  <br>When it comes to psychic attack, you most definitely fight fire with fire. Attacks are against your very spirit, so it’s up to you to defend _yourself_ with all your spiritual might. Above all, do not send “love” to your attacker. Do not forgive or forget their abuses. To forgive a single instance of evil is, philosophically-speaking, to forgive _all_ evil through time, which is a right you have not been given.  <br>  <br>Understand that pain, sorrow, illness, loss and conflict are signs that something is off bio-psychically. These states occur when body, mind and world are out of attunement.  <br>  <br>Contrary to what you have been taught to believe, the imbalance is often not your fault. It is probably caused by the proximity of toxic, spiritually unworked people. Therefore, it is important that you understand the manner in which the influence of other people affects and disaffects your life. Find out how much of what you decide upon and want is based on the influence of others.  <br>  <br>Regardless of your natural composure and equilibrium, the presence of others undeniably serves to attune or detune you. This is why your character can be judged by observing the kind of friends you make. As Emerson said, “A real friend never gets in your way, unless you happen to be on the way down.”  <br>  <br>Psychologically and emotionally you need nothing from others. What you require must be brought up or created from _within_. The morally superior individual refuses to serve a master, and also refuses to enslave others. He is careful not to violate the psychic sovereignty of those he cares for, and is equally careful to own his ground and not be violated in the name of love or duty.  <br>  <br>Key to the decording and healing process is _soul-retrieval_. Heavy doses of energy have been exchanged during the toxic relationship partly because you gave time, care and resources to undeserving people. You have the perfect right to take that energy back. This is accomplished by meditation on the subject and appropriate visualization.  <br>  <br>The healing process concludes once you make a distinct point of forgiving _yourself_ for past foolishness and lack of boundary. Focus on the lessons learned and wisdom received from your experience of evil. Betrayal of Self eventually resulted in the strengthening of Selfhood, so take a deep breath, forgive yourself and move on.|---|

||> On no account should you reopen contact with a vamp after your relationship with them has been brought to a definite close. It is not likely that a vamp will attempt to come back into your life after they’ve been exposed as deviants. However, in special cases you might find that they are interested in getting back into your good graces. There are several reasons for this, but they are not important. The main thing to remember is to never welcome them back, regardless of their attempts to convince you that they feel sorry or have changed. Your time is best spent with newfound friends who genuinely deserve your care and attention.|---|
