||In his book, R. A. Gabriel shows that Christianity did not evolve from Judaism but from _Osirianism_. This is, of course, not an idea that Gabriel initiates. It has been noted by many a previous author, such as Gerald Massey, Godfrey Higgins and John G. Jackson, etc. For example, in Jackson's _Pagan Origins of the Christ Myth,_ published in 1941, we read: "Christians unconsciously perpetuate the worship of Osiris and the commemoration of all his subjects in the Kingdom of the Dead." Sadly, Gabriel fails to reference pioneering authors who prefigured him. Nevertheless, overlooking this oversight and his conspicuous academic arrogance, Gabriel's _Jesus the Egyptian_ is a good modern study of the true origins of the Christian religion - Mtsar||

|---|**Christianity is Egyptian**  <br>...Christianity derives the major premises of its theology from the Egyptian religious tradition, specifically the Osiris-Isis beliefs, that predated Christianity by several millennia. The protestations of some theologians to the contrary, Christianity did not derive from the Judaism of its day...  <br>  <br>**Awakening to the Suppressed Truth**  <br>...the soul, resurrection, judgement beyond the grave, and eternal life. Egyptian thinking on these subjects appeared to me to be theologically indistinguishable from the beliefs that formed the core of my own religious faith  <br>  <br>**Virgin Birth Duplicated**  <br>Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband, Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly - (Matthew 1:18-19)  <br>  <br>Here we encounter elements of the Isis myth. Isis too, conceived the god Horus after her husband, Osiris, was dead leaving her open to the charge of infidelity and her son to the charge of illegitimacy. Even Joseph believed that Mary had been unfaithful, for he "planned to dismiss her quietly," that is, to divorce her, only to be talked out of it by an angel who convinced him that Mary was impregnated by the Holy Spirit  <br>  <br>**Baptism, not Christian**  <br>Baptism is the most fundamental Christian rite insofar as one must be baptized to become a full participant in the rituals of the Christian faith...The origins of baptism are Egyptian...  <br>  <br>...The Egyptian baptismal rite has its origins in the Heliopolitan worship of the sun early in the Pyramid Age. The Egyptians believed that each morning the sun passed the waters of the ocean before being reborn each day and emerging purified and revitalized. The ritual baptism of the pharaoh each morning symbolized this event and renewed the life and vigor of the recipient. At the start of each day pharaoh entered the temple called the House of Morning where the king prepared to make himself worthy to greet the sun god. Two priests of Toth and Horus sprinkled him with water from the Sacred Lake of the temple. This holy water was believed to possess special properties for it was believed to be the body fluid of Osiris himself...  <br>  <br>...As if to insure that observers understood that the king was being transformed and reborn, portrayals of the pharaoh's baptism show a water jug held over his head with water pouring from it. The water is depicted not by the hieroglyph for water, but with the ankh, the hieroglyph that symbolized life...  <br>  <br>...The Egyptian rite of baptism's emphasis upon transforming the recipient so that he is acceptable to god is almost identical in meaning to what Christians attribute to Jesus when he was baptized...Through his baptism Christ is reborn in that like the Egyptian king his divinity is reaffirmed and his powers drawn from god are confirmed once again. Neither Jesus' baptism not Egyptian baptism were about washing away sins or seeking forgiveness for them  <br>  <br>**The Eucharist**  <br>The Eucharist sacrifice is the most magic-soaked ritual in Christianity and is most likely of Egyptian origin, although elements of it can be found in other pagan rituals  <br>  <br>Morton Smith suggests that accounts of the Eucharistic ritual found in surviving magical texts "have their closest parallels in Egyptian texts." Smith draws upon the material contained in the Demotic Magical Papyrus for examples of eucharistic rites that are similar to the text of the institution of the Christian eucharist. The Demotic Magical Papyrus was written in the third century C.E., but its content is much older.  <br>  <br>I am he of Abydos...I am this figure of one drowned that testifieth by writing...as to which the blood of Osiris bore witness...when it was poured in this cup, this wine. Give it, blood of Osiris that he gave to his Isis to make her feel love for him...give it, the blood of (magician's name) to (recipients name) in this cup, this bowl of wine, today, to cause her to feel a love for him in her heart, the love that Isis felt for Osiris  <br>  <br>**Imperialist Suppression**  <br>In 356 C.E. Constantinus II ordered the Egyptian temples of Isis-Osiris closed and forbade the use of Egyptian hieroglyphics as a religious language. In 380 C.E. Emperor Theodosius declared Christianity to be the official Roman state religion, and all pagan cults were thereafter forbidden. These edicts were devastating to Egyptian culture and religion, both of which had been preserved over millennia through the Egyptian language and the writing systems of Egyptian priests. In 391 C.E. the Patriarch of Alexandria, Theophilus, summoned the monks to arms and turned them against the city of Memphis and the great shrine of Serapis, the Serapeum, the main temple of the Osirian-Isis religion. The attack was akin to ordering the destruction of the Vatican. Egyptian priests were massacred in their shrines and in the streets. The ferocity of the violence consumed priests, followers, and the Egyptian intellectual elite of Alexandria, Memphis, and other cities of Egypt who were murdered and their temples and libraries destroyed. The institutional structure of Egyptian religion, then more than four millennia old, was demolished in less than two decades  <br>  <br>...The wave of religious terrorism that swept Egypt for twenty years seemed to some Egyptians to herald the end of the world. "If we are alive," one wrote, "then life itself is dead."  <br>  <br>**The Trinity**  <br>Among the most amazing and important events of the Ptolemaic period was the establishment of the cult of the Egyptian Osiris trinity as the official religion of a state ruled by Macedonian Greeks with the result that the cult of Isis spread throughout the Mediterranean world becoming the most popular religion of the age. The cult of Isis, Osiris, and Horus was transmitted to Rome where, by the time of Christ, it had become the most popular religious faith of Romans, especially Roman soldiers  <br>  <br>Long before St. Paul spread the good news to the Christians, the priests and lay followers of Isis had spread their gospel to the people of the Mediterranean basin.  <br>  <br>**The Concept of Soul**  <br>Egyptian theologians appear to have been the first people to conceive of the idea of a soul as an animating principle of human material existence that was, in itself, immaterial in substance and immortal in nature so that its existence persisted beyond the death of the material body. The idea was a soul was among the earliest theological concepts invented by the Egyptians, appearing for the first time in written form during the Pyramid Age but having existed for at least a millennium before that in Egyptian religious thinking as contained in the Osiris myth  <br>  <br>**First Ethical Books and Philosophy**  <br>There are only two civilizations sufficiently old to qualify as the source of ethical thinking: Egypt and Mesopotamia. Both emerged about six thousand years ago and developed writing and man's first serious theologies at about the same time. But it was Egypt that gave the world the gift of conscience  <br>  <br>While other cultures had their theologies, the depth, breadth, complexity, and level of abstraction of Egyptian religious thinking make it difficult to escape the impression that Egyptian theologians gave the world the first theology worthy of the name  <br>  <br>**Virtue Not Judeo-Christian**  <br>The Old and New Testaments were plagiarizations and adaptations of the following Egyptian documents on morality and right living:  <br>  <br><br>- The Book of Coming Into Life (or Coming Forth by Day)<br>- The Pyramid Texts<br>- Memphite Drama: (From the Pyramid Age, 2780 BC)<br>- Maxims of Ptahhotep (by priest of King Isesi, Fifth Dynasty)<br>- Instructions of Kagemni (by Vizier of Pharaoh Sneferu, 2700 BC)<br>- Instructions of Amenemhat<br>- Instruction of Amenemope<br>- Maxims of Ani<br>- Dialogue of a Misanthrope With His Own Soul<br>- Song of the Harp-Player (2100 BC)<br>- Admonition of Ipuwer<br><br>  <br>Reading any one of these hoary manuscripts, let alone all of them, lays to rest forever the nonsensical propagandist idea that the world only learned how to be moral and righteous after the Moses and his Israelites arrived at Mount Sinai where they received the Ten Commandments. ([Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ancient_Egyptian_literature) for a list of Egyptian wisdom texts predating the rise of Judaism and Christianity.)  <br>  <br>**Direct Plagiarization**  <br>_Have I not written for thee thirty sayings, of counsel and knowledge! That thou mayest make known truth to him that speaketh, That thou mayest carry back words to him that sent thee -_ (Proverbs 22:20-21)  <br>  <br>_Consider these thirty chapters: They delight, they instruct. Knowledge how to answer him that speaketh, And how to carry back a report to one who sent him_ - (Amenemope, ch30)  <br>  <br>_Incline thine ear, and hear my words, And apply thine heart to apprehend; For it is pleasant if thou keep them in thy belly, that they may be fixed like a peg upon thy lips -_ (Proverbs 22:17-18)  <br>  <br>_Give thine ear, and hear what I say, And apply thine heart to apprehend; It is good for thee to place them in thine heart, let them rest in the casket of thy belly; That they may act as a peg upon thy tongue_ - (Amenemope, ch1)  <br>  <br>_Rob not the poor, for he is poor, neither oppress the lowly in the gate -_ (Proverbs 22:22)  <br>  <br>_Beware of robbing the poor, and oppressing the afflicted_ - (Amenemope, ch2)  <br>  <br>**Man - His Own Savior**  <br>Unlike the Israelites and early Christians, the Egyptians did not believe that sin represented a transgression of divine law nor was sin a personal ritual affront to the god as the Babylonians believed. There was no expectation that the gods would punish sin on this earth. There are no instances in Egyptian theology that parallel the murderous punishments of Yahweh against the sinners among his own people...No one but the individual himself caused sin and no one but the individual was responsible for it. The idea of a sinful human nature central to Christian ethics but unconvincing to Judaism was absent from Egyptian moral thinking  <br>  <br>**Life Beyond the Grave**  <br>The Egyptians believed in a life beyond the grave from very earliest times and the doctrine of eternal existence became a leading feature of their religious life history. It was an idea that greatly affected Egyptian thinking about ethics, for if life was possible beyond the grave, then the question of who was to be saved and how became a central moral question. Breasted rightly claimed that "among no people, ancient or modern, has the idea of life beyond the grave held no prominent a place as among ancient Egyptians"  <br>  <br>**Cult of Osiris**  <br>The principles of Egyptian theology were all derived from the incorporation of the Osiris myth into the body of traditional Egyptian religious thought, a process that began even before the First Union (3200 BC).  <br>  <br>Once the Osiris myth asserted its importance within the state solar theology, it was a matter of time before it would spread to the rest of the populace. The great attraction of the Osiris myth was its promise of life after death  <br>  <br>**Osiris and Jesus**  <br>The story of Osiris, his death, resurrection, and reward of eternal life has all the characteristics of a dynastic struggle with historical roots that was later infused with theological substance. The legend begins with a conflict between two brothers, Osiris and Set, who because they were kings or, perhaps, aspirants to the same throne, were regarded as sons of god who had taken on a human nature upon their birth, an idea that pharaohs adopted to explains their own divine origins. The divine Osiris became man and suffered a human destiny by becoming moral. He endured evil, torment, and death as the experience of his humanity, and because the only Egyptian god to suffer death and rise again from it, events that make him from all the other gods of ancient Egypt. The parallel with the Christian doctrine concerning Jesus' human nature and incarnation is obvious...  <br>  <br>**The Coptic Church**  <br>The ancient Coptic Christians, familiar with much of the evidence presented in these pages, concluded long ago that God had prepared the land of Egypt in a special way for his Christ. The Copts may be justified in their conclusion, for Egyptian religion more than Judaism seems the more appropriate well-spring of Christianity...Jesus' teachings and rituals did not represent a unique theological creed, and certainly not an historical singularity as theologians sometimes claim. Jesus' teachings and his ritual practice were indistinguishable in every important detail from those espoused and practiced by the Osiris-Isis faith that had existed for thousands of years before Jesus was born, and which was the dominant pagan cult in Palestine and throughout the Roman world at the time that Jesus lived  <br>  <br>**Conflict Between Horus and Set**  <br>Christine Hobson argues strongly for the view that the Osiris myth has historical roots. She notes that in pre-dynastic times there were few major cities along the Nile. One of these cities was Nubt (near modern Naqada), whose priesthood was dedicated to the local god Seth. Nubt was an idea marketing center standing on the banks of the Nile bank near Wadi Hammamat...The other town located south of modern Luxor was the town of Nekhen (modern El Kab). Its local god was the falcon or Horus, a fact that gave rise much later to the Greeks calling it Hieraconopolis of Falcon city. The ancient story of the battle between Horus and Seth that was folded into the Osiris myth was probably a folk memory of a war between these two cities. The victory of Horus over Seth, that is of Hieraconopolis over Nubt, gave the former authority over all of Upper Egypt as well as southward to the Nubian border  <br>  <br>**Massacre of the Innocent**  <br>When Set learns that the child he knows as Horus will someday attempt to revenge his father. Set sets out to kill Horus. Isis hid in the reeds and swamps of the Nile Delta where she nursed and raised her son.|---|
