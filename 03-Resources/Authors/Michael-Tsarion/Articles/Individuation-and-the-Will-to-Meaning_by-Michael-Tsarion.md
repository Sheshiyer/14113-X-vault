## Beyond Freudian Reductionism

Although Carl Jung and Otto Rank started their illustrious careers as Freudians, they were never as committed as their great mentor to the theory concerning the primacy of the sex drive. Although sexuality relies on libido or energy, energy must be thought of as the essence of more than just animalistic drives and sexual instincts. Energy is foundational and all-pervasive. No aspect of consciousness can be what it is without it.

Given this fact, questions arise as to what libido is, *in itself.* If all growth relies on it, what can be said about its apparent purpose? Even if, like Schopenhauer, we refer to it as "will," we are still left to sensibly describe it. Apparently we know more about Black Holes than we do about our own life-force.

Freud made a great effort to show the effects of the will, but something about his definition seems lacking. After all, his view of life was reductive. As far as he was concerned, human experience is merely a matter *of* matter.

It's all about the stuff of the objective world knocking up against our all too physical senses, nerves and neurons. Mind need not apply. There's no such thing as mind. Matter affects matter and that is all we need to know about and study.

> *"...no behaviorist has observed anything that he can call consciousness, sensation, imagery, perception or will"* - J. B. Watson

## The Materialist Illusion

The notion of mind allegedly comes about due to the physical *complexity* of cognitive and neurological systems. Our brains cannot function efficiently with open uninhibited access to all this complexity, which needs to be condensed and simplified. The governing capacities of the brain - that consolidate and delimit the brain's own content - give rise to the illusion we call "mind." It's less a case of reality than of language, description and convenience, say the Materialists.

The system directs energy into tasks of organization and compression. It's all for the good. It serves our basic need to interact effectively with our environment, so what we need at any given point is quickly and easily located and seized.

Analyzing this process reveals something about the efficiency of mental systems, such as that of the so-called Left-Hemisphere. This in turn impacts our understanding of the nature of energy. Will or energy is predominately a matter of concentration, economy and efficiency. It's a fact worth remembering.

## The Nature of Will and Energy

In this sense, will or energy is instrumental to everything we are and come to be. It avails us with all we require to be focused, driven thinkers and actors. It avails the contentment we need as well as the means of survival.

Even though physical necessities come first, energy satisfies other needs. It allows us to become what we desire to be. No professor of psychology or linguistics gets to be what he is without libido. But what does he really understand about this fundamental phenomenon? Although he feels it moving through him, as a "fire in the belly," or burning ambition, does he ever ask about its origin and nature? Of course not. Like the rest of us, he merely takes the reins and rides it toward his destination.

Sometimes the will takes the scenic route and we get to enjoy the journey. That's a nice bonus. At other times it runs us ragged. We can't really complain about our cuts and bruises if we successfully arrive at our desired destination. It's just collateral damage to be written off.## The Journey to Individuation

In psychological terms, if all goes well, the will leads us to our ultimate destination, which Jung defined as Individuation.

It's not just an endpoint in any prosaic sense. Something concerning the destination had to exist right at the outset, in potentia. We had to have a vague idea of the map before setting out. It's not a clear enough picture to be sure, and we don't consciously apprehend it. However, the end cannot be reached without some prevoyant grasp of what the great journey entails and what the end will be.

There can be no doubt that most of what exists strives toward a more advanced state of being. We call this "becoming." The blossom of a tree is what it is due to this *willless* act of becoming. The blossom was in the seed and the *new* seed is in the blossom. It's the cycle of necessity, and we are part of it.

Aristotle addressed this movement from potentia to actuality, referring to it as *entelechy*. It describes the connection or path between what was and what is; the past and the present, the seed and the blossom.

In the professor, something of the teenager or infant still exists whether he likes it or not.

All things began in a relatively primitive state. Traces of that originary state remain no matter what later stages bring. The "primitive state" merely describes the foundations upon which all life stands. But it's not a good word. It suggests inferiority and skews our understanding of the true nature of nature.

> **Aristotelian Wisdom:** Greek philosopher Aristotle (330 BC) held that all things grow purposively toward their fullest expression. All things are as he wrote, *teleological.* They have a specific end encoded within their essences. Each thing's identity isn't fully realized until the end is reached. In the case of an oak tree, for example, the majestic full-grown oak was already implicit *within* the acorn. The process of maturation is also known as *entelechy.* Today, Aristotle's theory is better known as Emergence.

## The Problem of Historical Projection

Problematically, what we know about foundational states depends not on evidence as much as projections made from where we presently stand. For example, what we think we know about the ancient past is possibly erroneous. This is because we stand where we are looking back, supposing this and that about the past. We forget that we're not *there* in real time finding out what we need to know. We are encouraged to make unfalsifiable statements about the past. Our present understanding won't be helped if our knowledge of the past is false.
