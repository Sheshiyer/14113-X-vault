## The Foundation of Idealism

**Idealism is based on the principle that the mind has a great bearing on how we experience reality.** How do we get to speak about and describe reality, let alone experience it? We all agree that reality exists and that it's not just a matter of words. But what is it really? And if our minds alter the reality we think we know, what is it like beyond the mind's representation of it?

In the seventeenth century, Irish philosopher George Berkeley said that there is no such thing as matter or a material world. This is because what we call "matter" is nothing but an *idea* in our heads - hence idealism. It may be better expressed as *idea-ism*. Berkeley was ruthlessly mocked by one and all, particularly by hardline Materialists.

## The Quantum Vindication

**Now, after decades of exploration into the Quantum Universe, skeptics, physicalists and reductionists are forced to accept that the principles of Idealism are correct. Because it has been scientifically proven beyond all doubt that what we call matter (and reality) is indeed altered by he who *observes* it, materialism is rendered null and void for all time.**

**That is the major change in the zeitgeist of our times. Papers have gone flying and there's a lot of bummed folks out there licking their wounds.**

**Of course, the revival of Idealism has enormous ramifications for many areas of life. All sorts of cherished scientific paradigms - such as classical physics and neuroscience, etc - are undergoing major revision as I write. Reality is mind-dependent after all, like Berkeley, Blake, and many other sages of the past said, only to be ridiculed and professionally assassinated. All in the name of a lie.**

## The Kantian Crisis

**Since it appears that we cannot penetrate into the mysteries of matter, and of creation, many are inclined to take refuge in skepticism. In fact, skepticism has been around since Plato's age, maybe even before.**

**Later in history, skepticism seemed validated by the discoveries and statements of Immanuel Kant. He too believed that since ultimate reality is permanently screened and off-limits to human reason, what we call philosophy is not as unshakably founded and valid as we like to believe.**

> **Kant's Impact:** Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was the first major thinker to scrutinize the limits of thought. Truth, he said, is really a subjective matter. Reality isn't known as it is in itself, only as the mind shapes it. Since objective knowledge is a chimera, we are right to be skeptical about the role of philosophy. The only way out of skepticism is to have faith. This announcement was rejected by the German Idealists Johann Fichte, Friedrich Hölderlin, Friedrich Schelling, Georg Hegel, and others. Even if the transcendent is elusive, it's not because of the reasons put forth by Kant. Therefore, better explanations for the elusiveness of Spirit must be found. On no account, however, must philosophy be abandoned.

## The Consequences of Kantian Skepticism

**Although most of Kant's statements were proven false, the world carried on as if nothing happened. Kant's startling announcements were taken onboard and the insightful criticisms of his opponents, countering skepticism, were misrepresented and largely forgotten. It has had dreadful consequences for western civilization and has allowed all sorts of absurd movements and notions to thrive for far too long.**

**Shortly after Kant's time, in Germany of the late eighteenth century, a major schism occurred between those affected and disaffected by the Kantian project.**

## The Romantic Retreat

**The Romantics held that if the Absolute has hidden aspects - and if its nature can only be approximated - why think about it at all? In their minds questions of unshakable First Principles and a transcendent source of knowledge were absurdities. This was due to *their* reading of Kant.**

**Also, because Being *precedes* self-consciousness, the case for Being's elusiveness is rendered a certainty. Therefore, it follows that since we cannot have direct and complete knowledge of Being, why indulge in philosophy at all? It leads only to nonsense, said the Romantics. Let's direct attention and effort to purely human affairs and dump the metaphysics.**

**This edict was proposed, of course, in the name of freedom.**

## The German Idealist Response

**Fichte, Hölderlin, Schelling and Hegel vehemently disagreed and actively attempted to save western philosophy from collapsing into insignificance at the hands of skeptics and Romantics.**
