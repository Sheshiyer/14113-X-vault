||**Stellar Cult Cryptically Referenced**  <br>But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; who once were not a people but are now the people of God - (1 Peter 2:9)  <br>  <br>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels - (Hebrews 12:22)  <br>  <br>For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland. And truly if they had called to mind that _country_ from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return. But now they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country_._ Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them - (Hebrews 11:14)  <br>  <br>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven - (Deuteronomy 4:19)  <br>  <br>And he brought me into the inner court of the Lord's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshiped the sun toward the east - (Ezekiel 8:16)  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The true "Jews" and "Israelites" were the initiated priests of the ancient Stellar Cult, their subject of study being the zodiac - the true Holy Place**,** Holy of Holies, Tabernacle, Temple,  New Jerusalem, Heavenly City, Place of the Elect, City of God, City of Zion, etc**.** Only after generations of mythmongering and garbled translations and deliberate obfuscation did these motifs and topes of the Stellar Cult get transposed to other phenomena, to common folk, customs and traditions. Once they entered Jewish and Christian texts we find them in forms even farther removed from their natural meanings. This is why rabbis and priests _demanded_ literal interpretations only. One is forced to accept it all "on faith" as the world of God. As far as the priests of the Arya (Stellar Cult) would be concerned, the true heavenly abode and "sacred text" has long be abandoned by fools and decievers. Hence the state of the world.<br><br>  <br>**Maimonides** **on Dogma**  <br>We ought not to take literally that which is written in  the Book of the Creation, nor entertain the same ideas of  it as are common with the vulgar.  <br>  <br>**Gospel of Philip on Ignorance**  <br>Spiritual ignorance is the mother of all evil. Ignorance will eventuate in death, because those who come from ignorance neither were, nor are, nor shall be.  <br>  <br>**Book of Enoch on Ignorance**  <br>Sin has not been sent upon the Earth, but man of himself has created it.  <br>  <br>**Book of Mark on Ignorance**  <br>It is from within, out of the mind of man that all evil emerges - (Mark 7:21)  <br>  <br>**St. Gregory on Ignorance and Gullibility**  <br>Nothing can impose better upon the rabble than verbiage; the less they understand the more they admire.  <br>  <br>**Origen (Church Father)**  <br>What man is there so simple as to believe that God, personifying a gardener, planted a garden in the East? that the tree of life was a real tree, which could be touched, and the fruit of which had the power of preserving life?  <br>  <br>What man is there so simple as to believe that God, personifying a gardener, planted a garden in the East? that the tree of life was a real tree, which could be touched, and the fruit of which had the power of preserving life? – Origen  <br>   <br>**Schopenhauer on Ignorance**  <br>They (men) would sooner die than think. It is very curious that the universality of an opinion should have so much weight with people, as their own experience might tell them that its acceptance is an entirely thoughtless and merely imitative process. But it tells them nothing of the kind, because they possess no self-knowledge whatever - (_How to Argue Logically_)  <br>  <br>**Rev. Robert Taylor on Ignorance**  <br>There were no books, save painfully written and very costly manuscript, worth the ransom of princes, and utterly unattainable except by the very wealthy and by the church. Not ‘till about 1450 was the first book known in Europe – (_The Devil’s Pulpit_)  <br>  <br>**Goethe Predicts Future Ignorance and Deviance**  <br>Goethe had a premonition of this decline of the West...even in October 1801 he remarked in conversation...that spiritual emptiness and lack of character were spreading - as if he had foreseen what today characterizes the most celebrated literature of the Free West. It may be that Goethe had even foreseen, in the distant future, the coming of an age in which writers would make great profits by the portrayal of sex and crime for the masses. As Goethe said to Eckermann...“the representation of noble bearing and action is beginning to be regarded as boring, and efforts are being made to portray all kinds of infamies.” Previously...he had pointed out at least one of the causes of the decline: in the larger cities men lived in a constant frenzy of acquisition and consumption and had therefore become incapable of the very mood from which spiritual life arises. Even then he was tortured and made anxious, although he could observe only the beginnings of the trend, the sight of the machine system gaining the upper hand; he foresaw that it would come and strike...he pronounced it as his view that the educated world remained rooted in mediocrity, and that a century had begun “for competent heads, for practical men with an easy grasp of things, who...felt their superiority above the crowd, even if they themselves are not talented enough for the highest achievements”; pure simplicity was no longer to be found, although here was a sufficiency of simple stuff; young men would be excited too early and then torn away by the vortex of the time - Hans K. Gunther  <br>  <br>**Henry L. Mencken on Christianity**  <br>The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only opposed to the scientific spirit, it is also opposed to all attempts at rational thinking.  <br>  <br>**Northrop Frye on the Bible**  <br>It is futile also to try to distinguish what is "original" in the Bible, the authentic voices of its great prophetic and poetic geniuses, from the later accretions and corruptions sometimes alleged to surround them. The editors are too much for us: they have pulverized the Bible until almost all sense of individuality has been stamped out of it – (_The Great Code_)  <br>  <br>**Thomas Paine on Christianity**  <br>Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is none more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory in itself, than this thing called Christianity. Too absurd for belief, too impossible to convince, and too inconsistent for practice, it renders the heart torpid, or produces only atheists and fanatics. As an engine of power, it serves the purposes of despotism; and as a means of wealth, the avarice of priests; but so far as respects the good of man in general, it leads to nothing here or hereafter.  <br>  <br>…when the New Testament was written, I might say invented, the art of printing was not known...the book was in the hands of very few persons, and these chiefly of the Church...This gave an opportunity to the writers of the New Testament to make quotations from the Old Testament as they pleased, and called them prophecies, with very little danger of being detected. Besides which, the terrors and inquisitorial fury of the Church...stood sentry over the New Testament; and time, which brings everything else to light, has served to thicken the darkness that guards it from detection.  <br>  <br>I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of...Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all.  <br>  <br>I would not dare to so dishonor my Creator God by attaching His name to that book (the Bible).  <br>  <br>Among the most detestable villains in history, you could not find one worse than Moses. Here is an order, attributed to 'God' to butcher the boys, to massacre the mothers and to debauch and rape the daughters. I would not dare so dishonor my Creator's name by (attaching) it to this filthy book (the Bible).  <br>  <br>It is the duty of every true Deist to vindicate the moral justice of God against the evils of the Bible.  <br>  <br>Accustom a people to believe that priests and clergy can forgive sins...and you will have sins in abundance.  <br>  <br>The Christian church has set up a religion of pomp and revenue in pretended imitation of a person (Jesus) who lived a life of poverty.  <br>  <br>**President Thomas Jefferson**  <br>The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter - (Letter to J. Adams April 11, 1823)  <br>  <br>I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth.  <br>  <br>The clergy converted the simple teachings of Jesus into an engine for enslaving the world and adulterated by artificial constructions into a contrivance to filch wealth and power to themselves…these clergy, in fact, constitute the real Anti-Christ.  <br>  <br>**President John Madison**  <br>What influence in fact have Christian ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In many instances they have been upholding the thrones of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty have found in the clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy.  <br>  <br>**President John Adams**  <br>The doctrine of the divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity.  <br>  <br>**Sigmund Freud** **on Religion**  <br>In my Future of an Illusion…I was concerned much less with the deepest sources of the religious feeling than with what the common man understands by his religion - with the system of doctrines and promises which on the one hand explains to him the riddles of this world with enviable completeness, and, on the other, assures him that a careful Providence will watch over his life and will compensate him in a future existence for any frustrations he suffers here. The common man cannot imagine this Providence otherwise than in the figure of an enormously exalted father. Only such a being can understand the needs of the children of men and be softened by their prayers and placated by the signs of their remorse. The whole thing is so patently infantile, so foreign to reality, that to anyone with a friendly attitude to humanity it is painful to think that the great majority of mortals will never be able to rise above this view of life. It is still more humiliating to discover how large a number of people living today, who cannot but see that this religion is not tenable, nevertheless try to defend it piece by piece in a series of pitiful rearguard actions.  <br>  <br>**Lovers of Knowledge**  <br>Pope Gregory declared that all education originated with the devil and then even outlawed the reading of the Bible by laymen. Just possessing a copy of the Bible in a vernacular translation was grounds for the death penalty. Schools and centers of learning were closed, and works of art and imagination were specially frowned upon. Hundreds of beautiful temples were leveled to the ground and monks were assigned to "defile the site with their excrement" - Denis William Hauck (_The Emerald Tablet_)  <br>  <br>**Hebrew Language?**  <br>St. Gregory of Nyssa remarks that the most learned men of his time knew positively that the Hebrew language was not so ancient as most other languages, and that the Hebrews never spoke it until after their departure from Egypt – A. D. Thompson (_On Mankind_)  <br>  <br>…not a single inscription has been found in Palestine which can be identified with the Hebrew kingdom - H. D. Daunt (_The Center of Ancient Civilization_)  <br>  <br>The Hebrew alphabet contains twenty-two letters, six vowels and sixteen consonants. But it has not always contained so many letters. The words of the written language being known only to the priests, they became a  learned language," a 'language of doctrine and of teaching," and, as it was only read and interpreted in consecrated places or in the temples, and for the priesthood, it was also called, ''the holy language," " the sacred language," and "the holy doctrine' – A. D. Thompson (_On Mankind_)  <br>  <br>**People vs. Priests**  <br>Though most of the priests encouraged the people in their errors, a few endeavoured to bring about a reform. For this purpose they formed the project of initiating the whole people, that is, of revealing to them the profound truths which were usually reserved for a small number of privi- leged persons – A. D. Thompson  <br>  <br><br>- Note: This vitally important revelation speaks volumes. In the earliest times, the ordinary people among Jews and Israelites knew they could do a better job than their priests, and attempted to overthrow their rule. Who today knows what "errors" there are, and what evidence exists in the scriptures of priestly mythmongering? What was "borrowed" from numerous pagan sources? - Mtsar<br><br>  <br>The whole book of Leviticus is concerned with the clergy's power and control over the nation's worship, and the great material and financial benefits they could derive from such -  R. A. Anderson (_Church of God or the Temples of Satan_)  <br>  <br>**Biblical Gibberish**  <br>Saint John states nonsensically:  <br>  <br>There are also many other things which Jesus did the which, of they could be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.  <br>  <br>As the Bible story progresses, we are led to believe that the great royal house of David and Solomon gained its office because a shepherd-boy slew a giant with a stone. We are told absolutely nothing about its sovereign descent from the mighty dynasties of Mesopotamia and Egypt, and yet this is the book upon which oaths are sworn to tell ‘the truth, and nothing but the truth’ in courts of law - Laurence Gardner (_Genesis of the Grail Kings_)  <br>  <br>Jacob is made to be eighty-four years old when he took Leah to wife, while Dinah was scarcely seven years of age when she was violated by Shechem, and Simeon and Levi Were scarcely twelve and eleven years old when they ravaged a city and put all the inhabitants to the sword - A. D. Thompson  <br>  <br>The next occurrence is the one mentioned in Exodus 1:15-16, where we are told that Pharaoh ordered the two mid wives of the Israelites to kill all the male children. They did not do this, however, but made an excuse that the Israelite women were "very lively," and were delivered before the midwives could come to them. Pharaoh then ordered the Egyptians to drown all the male children. The Israelites must have been very few in number to require only two midwives, for it is expressly stated that they had no more; and it is difficult to understand after Pharaoh's command how there could be any men of twenty years of age, and able to carry arms, left. The old men must have been the sole survivors – A. D. Thompson  <br>  <br>**Love and Tolerance**  <br>...in 1654, because the Vatican Council decreed that anyone found not believing that the world was created in 4004 BC was a heretic and would be treated as such. Which could mean being burned at the stake or murdered in some equally horrible church-approved way...the edict was not repealed until 1952 - Heyeokah Guru (_Adam and Evil_)  <br>  <br>**Bible on Slavery**  <br>As for your male and female slaves whom you may have; you may buy male and female  slaves from among the nations that are round you. You may also buy from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their families that are with you, who have been born in your land; and they may be your property. You may bequeath them to your sons and after you, to inherit as a possession forever; you may make slaves of them, but over your brethren the people of Israel you shall not rule, one over the other, with harshness - (Leviticus 25:44-46)  <br>  <br>Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those whose are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. For it is commendable if a man bears up under pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God…But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God - (Peter 2:18-21)  <br>  <br>**Martin Luther on Slavery and Government**  <br>Nothing is more poisonous, harmful or devilish than a man in rebellion  <br>  <br>...even if those in authority are evil or without faith, nevertheless the authority and its power is good and from God...therefore wherever there is power and where it flourishes, there it is and there it remains because God has ordained it - (_Vorlesung uber den Romerbrief_)  <br>  <br>God would prefer to suffer the government to exist no matter how evil, rather than to allow the rabble to riot, no matter how justified they are in doing so...A prince should remain a prince no matter how tyrannical he may be. He beheads necessarily only a few since he must have subjects in order to be a ruler - (_Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants_)  <br>  <br>**E****xistence of Jesus Disputed**  <br>It was not until the eighteenth century that the idea that possibly Jesus never existed at all made a timid appearance with "some disciples of Bolingbroke (1678-1751)"…who, according to Voltaire…held that the obscurities and contradictions in the Gospel tradition gave them the right to deny the existence of Jesus. These ideas, which the disciples of Bolingbroke did not venture to express in writing, were made public at the close of the eighteenth century by Volney (1757–1820) and Dupuis (1742–1809). For these writers Jesus was neither a man nor a god; they claimed that he really represented a solar deity like the divinities which men have worshiped down the ages....The first author of the nineteenth century to pronounce definitely against the actual existence of Jesus was Bruno Bauer (1809–1882) - Maurice Goguel (_The Life of Jesus_)  <br>  <br>**Did Paul Know jesus?**  <br>Traditionally, Christians have been led to believe that Jesus was responsible for the teachings of Christianity. If this were true, the Gospels would have been written _before_ the Epistles and the Epistles of Paul would not overshadow the Gospels. Throughout the Epistles Paul states that what he is preaching is _his_ version of the Gospels. He also _never_ mentioned which are included in the canon of the SAcriptures, not does he mention anything actually said by Jesus - A. S. Holub (_The Gospel Truth_)  <br>  <br>**The "Christian" Catacombs**  <br>It is now generally accepted that no Christian catacomb painting can be dated earlier than 200 CE. The artistic style of the catacomb paintings, it is agreed, is not a novel Christian creation, but represents a continuation of styles found somewhat earlier in late Roman catacomb art. Early Christian catacomb art is thus an extension or continuation of Roman art, albeit under Christian patronage, and not a radical, new departure - H. W. Attridge and G. Hata (_Eusebius, Christianity and Judaism_)  <br>  <br>**Religion of Early Man**  <br>Primitive people, ancient or modern, make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural, between nature and man, human experience and cosmic events. They have no knowledge of natural laws or natural causation. Speculation among the ancients could not take an intellectual or rational form; it had to be poetic or imaginative. Theirs was a world of myth, magic, and miracle - F. G. Bratton (_Myths and Legends of the Ancient Near East_)  <br>  <br>**Astrology**  <br>Mankind has always scrutinized the heavens, looking for guidance, omens, meanings...The study of the Sun, the Moon, stars, eclipses, day and night, began well before recorded history – Joanna Woolfolk (_The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need_)  <br>  <br>Astrology is the key that opens the door to all occult knowledge. It is the key that unlocks the mysteries of man's being; his why, whence, whither. Within the temple of Urania lies concealed the mystery of life. The indices are there, written by the finger of the Infinite in the heavens above - Thomas Burgoyne (_The Light of Egypt_)  <br>  <br>**City Construction and Astrology**  <br>Most of these cities were built under the inspection and under the protection of a celestial sign. Their horoscope was drawn; hence the impression of the images of the constellations on their medals - Charles Francois Dupuis (_The Origin of all Religious Worship_)  <br>  <br>**Solar Worship**  <br>Although this god was everywhere and was all...yet did man prefer to look for him in those elevated regions, where that mighty and radiant luminary seems to travel through space...It would seem as if the Almighty had established his throne above that splendid azure vault, sown with brilliant lights, that from the summit of the heavens he held the reins of the World, that he directed the movements of its vast body, and contemplated himself in forms as varied as they are admirable, wherein he modifies himself incessantly - Charles Francois Dupuis (_The Origin of all Religious Worship_)  <br>  <br>So far as I can see, the Chaldean deities were primarily the powers of nature, - the earth, the sun, or the sky. These developed into distinct personalities, and the numerous epithets which were applied to them originated a vast mythology and an endless array of divinities, each epithet becoming a separate personality. As in the case of other nations, the Sun had been the chief object of worship, and the larger portion of the mythology accordingly grouped itself about the Sun-god and the numberless forms which he had assumed. The more I examine the Akkadian mythology, the more solar does its character appear - A. H. Sayce (_The Astronomy and Astrology of the Babylonians_)  <br>  <br>The early Israelites were mostly sun worshipers. And even in later times, the sun god, Baal, divided with Jehovah the worship of the Jews. Saul, Jonathan and David named their children in honor of this god - John E. Remsberg  <br>  <br>Sun-worship was by no means unknown to the Israelites....The myths that were circulated among these people show that they were zealous worshipers of the sun. These myths are still preserved, but, as in all other cases, they are so much altered as to be hardly recognizable. The writer who has preserved them for us lived at a time when the worship of the sun had long ago died out. He transforms the sun god into an Israelite hero (Samson) - Dr. H. Oort (_The Old Testament for Learners_)  <br>  <br>Charles Francois Dupuis, in his _Origin of Worship_, one of the most elaborate and remarkable works on mythology ever penned, shows that nearly all the religions of the world, including Christianity, were derived largely from solar worship. All the solar deities, he says, have a common history. This history, summarized, is substantially as follows: "The god is born about December 25th, without sexual intercourse, for the sun, entering the winter solstice, emerges in the sign of Virgo, the heavenly Virgin. His mother remains ever-virgin, since the rays of the sun, passing through the zodiacal sign, leave it intact. His infancy is begirt with dangers, because the new-born Sun is feeble in the midst of the winter's fogs and mists, which threaten to devour him; his life is one of toil and peril, culminating at the spring equinox in a final struggle with the powers of darkness. At that period the day and night are equal, and both fight for the mastery. Though the night veil the urn and he seems dead; though he has descended out of sight, below the earth, yet he rises again triumphant, and he rises in the sign of the Lamb, and is thus the Lamb of God, carrying away the darkness and death of the winter months. Henceforth he triumphs, growing ever stronger and more brilliant. He ascends into the zenith, and there he glows, on the right hand of God, himself God, the very substance of the Father, the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, upholding all things by his life-giving power" - John E. Remsberg  <br>  <br>In their aspirations for communion with the higher powers, the yearning of the ancient Chaldeans turned upwards to the planets and the stars. The horizon of the Babylonian plain was uniform and boundless. It was the heaven above rather than the earth beneath, which exhibited variety and life. The Zodiac was ever new with its brilliant evolutions. Through the clear atmosphere the tracks of the shining orbs could be traced in every phase and transposition. With each dawn of morning light, with each recurrence of the evening twilight, a new panorama spread before the reverent imagination of the dreamer, and he saw in the moving spheres not only the abode but the manifested glory of his gods - John C. Ridpath (_History of the World, Vol. 1_)  <br>  <br>**Mithras**  <br>Baptism was one of the observances in the worship of Adonis in Mesopotamia and Arabia. Those initiated in the Mysteries of Mithra were baptized - Samuel F. Dunlop (_Ghebers of Hebron_)  <br>  <br>The change to the Christian religion seems to have been helped on by the ideas previously taught in the Mysteries, and more or less taken up by the Jews and others. The Dionysus Mysteries were a concurrent factor in producing that mental status that predisposed minds towards the Resurrection theory and Christian sentiment - ibid  <br>  <br>He was the “divine son”…As companion in creation and “protector” of this world he kept the universe standing in its struggle against its enemies. At the head of the heavenly host he fought for God, and with his sword of flame he drove the Demons of Darkness in terror back into the shadows...descend upon the earth and in a last fierce struggle overwhelm Ahriman and his hosts, and cast them down into the Nether World. He would then raise the dead in bodily shape, and after a General Judgment of the whole world, in which the wicked should be condemned to the punishments of hell and the good raised to heavenly glory, establish the “millennial Kingdom of Peace" - Arthur Dewes (_The Christ Myth_)  <br>  <br>Among the ideas which were borrowed by Judaism from the Persian religion belonged those connected with the mediatory “Word.” As the creative power of the Godhead upon earth, the expression “the Word” had already appeared in aphoristic literature. Under Greco-Egyptian influence the term “wisdom” (sophia) had become a naturalized expression for it - ibid  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The howling of mullahs from minarets, throughout the Islamic world, was a custom appropriated, like numerous others, from the ancient Persians (Aryans). The ancient priests of Mithras sang hyms of praise not to Allah, but to the sun as it rose and set on the horizon. No supernaturalism was involved.<br><br>  <br>**Mary as Lucifer**  <br>Mary of Bethany, who did the anointing, was known by the Rabbis as Mary Lucifer - Mary the “light-bringer” – Picknett and Prince (_The Templar Revelation_)  <br>  <br>**Sacred Prostitutes**  <br>Women had their roles in the ancient cult. There were the sacred prostitutes - an office well known in the ancient world. It is usually assumed that the woman dedicated herself to the service of the god as a sexual partner in some imitative ritual designed to stimulate the generative faculties of the fertility deity. Doubtless, in many of the cults she did perform such a function, copulating before the altar with the priests or other male worshipers at certain festivals. There are also indications that it was considered necessary to make some sort of booth or covering for the prostitute and the magic plant during the seduction – John Allegro (_The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross_)  <br>  <br>**Political Reasons for the Calendar**  <br>From the beginning the Roman calendar was a powerful political tool that governed religious holidays, festivals, market days and constantly changing schedules of days when it was legal to conduct judicial and official business in the courts and governments...the inaccurate calendar played havoc not only with the farmers and sailors but also with a population becoming more dependent than ever on trade, commerce, law and civil administration in a rapidly growing empire that desperately needed a standard system for measuring time - David Duncan  (_The Calendar_)  <br>  <br>**Destruction of Judaism**  <br>Emperor Vespasian took possession of all Jewish religious artifacts that had previously been safely stored in the Temple, including the precious Torah, and stored them in the Capitoline Jove in Rome. He then proclaimed the entire Jewish territory the Roman Emperor’s personal property. And had his decision officially ratified by the Senate…Josephus recorded that Vespasian personally kept the Torah, revealing that it had at sometime been recovered from Rabbi Jesus Cunobeline and replaced in the Temple…the great Temple of Jerusalem was no longer, and the Jews had been disposed of their land, their treasure and the physical substance of their religion – Tony Bushby (_The Bible Fraud_)  <br>  <br>**1452**  <br>The first Vulgate or Latin version of the Bible was printed in Gutenberg**.**  <br>  <br>**Original Sin**  <br>Devised in the fifth century by St Augustine.  <br>  <br>**The Rapture**  <br>The Rapture was the concoction of John Nelson Darby, and Anglo-Irish Evangelist. The term is not in the Bible.  <br>  <br>**Mary and the Council of Trullo**  <br>In 692 AD, the Council of Trullo declared that Mary was the "ever-virgin." This declaration contradicts several scriptures, such as Matthew 1:25 &12:46, Mark 3:31 & 6:3, Luke 8:19 & John 2:12.  <br>  <br>**The Four Gospels**  <br>The four Gospels were first definitely mentioned by Irenaeus, writing about 190 AD, over one hundred fifty years after the alleged crucifixion.   <br>   <br>**Resurrection and Ascension**  <br>But the most remarkable point in this connection is the absolute silence of the Gospel of Mark on the subject of the resurrection and ascension - that is, of the original Gospel, for it is now allowed on all hands that the twelve verses Mark 15:9 to the end, are a later insertion. Considering the nature of this event, astounding indeed, if physically true, and unique in the history of the world, it is strange that this Gospel - the earliest written of the four Gospels, and nearest in time to the actual evidence - makes no mention of it. The next Gospel in point of time - that of Matthew - mentions the matter rather briefly and timidly, and reports the story that the body had been stolen from the sepulcher. Luke enlarges considerably and gives a whole long chapter to the resurrection and ascension; while the Fourth Gospel, written fully twenty years later still - say about A. D. 120 - gives two chapters and a great variety of details! – Edward Carpenter (_Pagan and Christian Creeds_)  <br>  <br>**Constantine**  <br>Roman Emperor Constantius married Princess Elaine of Britain. It was his son Constantine I, who was crowned Emperor of Rome in York, England. It was Constantine I who created Roman Catholicism as it is known and tried, unsuccessfully, to become the new Messiah through his assumed royal descent from the family of Jesus – Ralph Ellis (_Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs_)  <br>  <br>**No Public Prayer**  <br>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the street, that they be seen of men…But thou, when thou prayest, enter thy closet, and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret, and they father which is in secret shall reward thee openly…When you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think they will be heard for their much speaking. Be therefore not like them, for your father knows what things ye have need of, before ye ask him – (Matthew 6:5)|---|

The spirit of God creates armies: "By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, by the breath of his mouth, all their armies" (Psalms 33:6). The myth-creating cluster of the motifs of God's spirit and destruction is commonplace in biblical stories (e.g., Judges 14-16) viewing the spirit of God as dangerous. Job offers an argument to affirm this in presenting Yahweh's spirit in the metaphor of the roaring lion's breath: "By the breath of God they die; by the wind of his rage they are consumed" (Job 4:9). Isaiah too speaks of the creative spirit's destructive power, evoking the story of the destruction of Sodom: "The spirit of Yahweh is a stream of brimstone. It sifts the nations with the sieve of destruction" (Is 30:28, 33) - Professor Thomas L. Thompson (_The Messiah Myth_)  <br>  <br>Yahweh is said to teach warfare to the Davidic King: "He teaches my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze." (Psalm I8: 35). Elsewhere the king speaks of "Yahweh, my Rock, who teaches my hands for war, and my fingers for battle" (Psalm 144 : I). An illuminating parallel to this is to be seen in an Egyptian picture of the Egyptian god Seth teaching Pharaoh Thutmose to use the bow and arrow. - B. E. Colless (_Divine Education_)  <br>  <br>**Priests of Death**  <br>The man who acts presumptuously by not obeying the priest who stands to minister there before the Lord your God, or the judge, that man shall die. So you shall purge the evil from Israel - (Deuteronomy 17:12)  <br>  <br>**Death to all Non-Believers**  <br>That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman - (2 Chronicles 15:13)  <br>  <br>**12 Tribes, 12 Signs**  <br>Actually, these tribal emblems were in use far before the Exodus. In Genesis 49 we read that, just before his death, Jacob called his sons to him to give them his blessing. In this blessing Jacob likened each of his sons to some object, animal or personal characteristic, which then became his emblem and the emblem of his family and tribe descended from him. Moses added some additional items as recorded in Deuteronomy 33, with the result that each of the tribes of Israel had at least one emblem and some of them had two or more - W. H. Bennett (_Symbols of our Celto-Saxon Heritage_)  <br>  <br><br>- Note: With the addition of the Levites and Tribe of Manasseh (of the House of Judah), we really have 14 tribes. But with the Bible's emphasis on 12 tribes, we see that it is undeniably an crypto-astrological and crypto-astrotheological document. The Israelites were dividing their people according to the pattern laid down by many predecessors, such as the Phoenicians and Canaanites, etc, members of the solar and stellar cults of antiquity. Indeed, the Old Testament records that the twelve tribes were divided into four groups consisting of three tribes in each group, each of the three designated with a separate standard or banner (see Book of Numbers). Again, this is the pattern of the zodiac, in which each of the signs is categorized by _three_ modalities and _four_ elements.|---|

|---|The seal of the United States is based on the emblem of the thirteenth tribe of Israel, that of Manasseh. This is because, while in Egypt two tribes descended from Joseph - Ephraim and Manasseh. These two tribes, named after two sons of Joseph can be rightly said to comprise the "House of Joseph," as well as of Jacob. After the Exodus, the Tribe of Manasseh became associated with the southern house of Judah, along with the tribes of Benjamin and Judah. The Tribe of Manasseh had _two_ emblems, an olive tree or branch and twelve arrows. Note also the Star of David above the eagle's head. That the United States is symbolized by these old Israelite emblems isn't as remarkable as it seems. A study of American, British and European history shows that there are dozens of emblems, crests, insignias, flags and heraldic devices featuring Israelite (and Jewish) symbols. The three lions seen on the flag of Richard the Lionheart, the tree on the arms of Scotland, and lion on the heraldry of Great Britain (along with the unicorn or white horse) all derive from that source. Other Israelite symbols include the ship, knight on horseback, chalice, bull's head, horn, wolf, tower or turret, castle or fortress, deer, ass, horse, serpent, sword, scepter, male face and waves of the sea. The harp and Star of David can be found on Irish crests and flags, while British Royals claim descent from King David. The British flag is called the "Union Jack," after _Jacob,_ the father of the twelve tribes. Why?|---|

|---|**Masonry**  <br>...in certain Masonic degrees it has been recognized for ages that the animals, objects and personal characteristics mentioned in Genesis 49 and Deuteronomy 33 were the emblems of the Israelite tribes - W. H. Bennett  <br>  <br><br>- Note: The reason for these symbols on British, European and American heraldry is given in my _Irish Origins of Civilization_ site and books. ([Here](http://www.irishoriginsofcivilization.com/) for more...)<br><br>  <br>**Star of David**  <br>This symbol can be found on a Scottish cup, dated over 1,000 years ago. However, this cup was presented to Clan MacLeod by Irish chieftains, which means the cup dates to a much earlier date. The Star of David, then, appears in Ireland from the earliest times. Given that Egyptian princesses and pharaohs have been found buried in Ireland, a lot of questions arise that require answering about ancient East to West connections.  <br>  <br>The Star of David can still be seen today on the  national insignias of Northern Ireland. The crown of King David - of the Kingdom of Judea - is also visible, and King David's harp is commonly seen on the flags and emblems of both Northern and Southern Ireland. As I show, in _Astro-Theology and Sidereal Mythology_ and _The Irish Origins of Civilization,_ these symbols were not the property of a single tribe or nation. On the contrary, they were known and used the world over by members of the Solar and Stellar Cults.|---|
