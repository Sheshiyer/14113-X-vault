| **Israelites in Egypt?**  <br>It has always seemed peculiar that the so-called Books of Moses give practically no information about the culture of the Egyptians during the four hundred years in which the sons of Israel are said to have lived in Egypt. No mention is made of Egyptian achievements in astronomy, mathematics or architecture, nor are the pyramids, the great monuments at Thebes and Karnak even mentioned in the Scriptures.  <br>  <br>It is equally strange that the Book of Exodus gives the only record we have of the plagues of Moses and the slaughter of the first-born of the Egyptians. Yet, the sickness, disease and death caused by these acts of vengeance would have brought panic and disaster so extensive as to make it inconceivable that Egyptian historians could have failed to mention them.  <br>  <br>**Destruction and Absorption**  <br>Efforts of the early leaders of Israel to exterminate the sun and moon cults constitute one of the longest and most bizarre struggles in history. Details of the struggle are of special interest to people of Christian countries because the religion of the Jews became the foundation stone of the Christian religion.   <br>  <br>**Early Judaism and Paganism**  <br>But to assume that all sons of Israel were firm believers of Jahveh and, therefore, unanimous in their hatred of pagan cults would be far from the truth. The Scriptures make clear the fact that, from the Mosaic period onward, a considerable number of Israelites found the warm, sensuous rites of Baal and the Mother Goddess more attractive than the stern worship of Jahveh.  <br>  <br>Many of the Israelites seem to have considered Jahveh to be a mere tribal god, holding supreme power over them but powerless against their enemies.  <br>  <br>**Who is God?**  <br>The word Aleim or Elohim which is employed 2570 times in the Bible as a title for God is also composed of male and female roots and must be considered as having had the same origin and meaning as Jahveh. Al, El, Il or Ilah, meaning lord, was a very ancient title of the sun among Arabians, whence was derived the Mohammedan title of Allah.  <br>  <br>Elohim means "judges" or those who sit in judgement.  <br>  <br>**The Zadokites**  <br>...the temple in Jerusalem was to be the only legitimate sanctuary of Jahveh and it was to be served only by the Zadokite, or hereditary priests. Thus, by one sudden, shrewd maneuver, the authority of the priests was greatly established. Local shrines were declared illegal, pagan cults and practices were outlawed, a line of social demarcation was drawn between the Jews and their pagan neighbors and the ground was prepared for a sweeping reformation.  <br>  <br>**The Gaonim**  <br>In 70 AD, the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed its population. Fearing that scattering the Jews over the earth might cause their ancient records to become lost led to the formation of a council of rabbis who met in Jamnia about the beginning of the second century AD, for the purpose of codifying the holy records and giving them permanent form.  <br>  <br>**Moses and Bacchus (Dionysus)**  <br>De Wette's discovery not only threw new light on Deuteronomy, it also made it necessary to reconsider the entire story of the life of Moses. Scholars had long known that many details in the life of the great law-giver were similar to events in the myths of the Greek go Bacchus. Like Moses, Bacchus was born in Egypt, was found floating in a basket and had both real and foster mothers. Like Moses, he made water gush from a stone by striking it with his staff; like Moses, he wore two horns on his head: he became a lawmaker and wrote his laws on two tablets of stone. Moses performed miracles with snakes and Bacchus was always portrayed with snakes. Moses waved his staff and made the waters of the Red Sea turn back and Bacchus did the same thing with the waters of the Orontes river in Syria and the Hydaspes in India.  <br>  <br>**William M. L. De Wette**  <br>De Wette contended that the reason certain laws in Deuteronomy contradict laws in other Books of the Pentateuch is because Deuteronomy was written at a later time, to meet conditions which had not existed when the other Books were written. But, in his effort to disprove the Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy, he failed to observe that there was just as much reason to doubt the authenticity of all the other so-called Books of Moses.  <br>  <br>**Astrology**  <br>From early times, the priests of Israel were called by names which signified they were astrologers or “dividers of the heavens.”  <br>  <br>**The Lunar Cult**  <br>The very earliest records of the ancient nations best known to us date from 3000 to 4000 BC, to a time when the sun cults were already gaining the ascendancy. Consequently, such knowledge as we have of the moon cults us derived from myths and legends which have continued to live in literature and customs so many centuries after the forms of worship to which they related had dissolved in the mists of the ages.  <br>  <br>**Lunar Time and the Hebrews**  <br>The many references in the Bible to the heathen cults give ample evidence that both sun and moon worships were practiced widely by the Hebrews in ancient Palestine. Prior to the promulgation of the Mosaic Code, the Jews employed lunar time, and it still remains the basis of their religious calendar.  <br>  <br>**Solar Symbolism**  <br>Many English churches are oriented so that the sun shines through the window above the high altar and worshipers face the sun. St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey in London, Notre Dame in Paris, St. Peter's in Rome and the Cathedral of Milan are oriented to the vernal equinox.  <br>  <br>**Library of Sardanapalus**  <br>Created by King Assurbanipul at Nineveh in Assyria and rediscovered in 1853. Gives us most of our knowledge of the Babylonians.  <br>  <br>**Age of Taurus**  <br>About 3,000 years ago was the time when the Solar Cult began gaining the ascendancy.  <br>  <br>In fact, sun worship does not appear to have existed as a distinct and wholly separate system, but was simply grafted on the older cult; and after the two became fused, the sun eventually became the dominant figure…but it is evident that as the new cults took root, new deities were created, and the scope of the religion was greatly enlarged, making it more complex and giving it a new orientation.  <br>  <br>**Latin Cross**  <br>The Latin cross appears on many ancient designs from Egypt and on seals representing Ishtar and the Phoenician goddess Astarte. Pagan Greeks used the cross as a symbol of Bacchus and Apollo and modified it to represent the features of the life-giving goddess Aphrodite, Harmonia, and Artemis of Ephesus.  <br>  <br>**Christian Deceit**  <br>At the Council called _In Trullo_, held at Constantinople in 692 AD, this policy was finally reversed and thereafter all crucifixes bore the figure of Jesus, although the lamb continued to be shown, usually at the foot of the cross. At first Jesus was represented fully robed, standing calmly before the cross with outstretched arms; later he was placed on the cross and finally represented undraped, bleeding and tortured by pain from wounds, as he is represented on crucifixes today.  <br>  <br>**The Dove - Queen of the Windows**  <br>I turn the male to the female and the female to the male. Connected with Venus, sexual initiation and fate. The Dove is her symbol. See how it still appears on the regalia of the Queen of England. The Dove or Columba, is a constellation that is in Taurus. It was a paranatellon of Scorpio. Ishtar descends into the Underworld. She was the original goddess of the rites of the Underworld. She is the original Persephone. The dove is a constellation in Scorpio, so Ishtar may be related to the signs on the western horizon. As goddess of the dark cycle she was also called Ashtaroth or Astarte. She later becomes Aphrodite and Venus. She is often seen naked with a crescent moon under her feet.  <br>  <br>**Serpent Symbolism**  <br>The Greeks portrayed Hygeia, Medusa, and Apollo with serpents. Serpents encircled the body of Athena. Demeter had as her attendant at Eleusis the snake Kychreus, who was probably an ancient snake god. As goddess of Phigalians, in Arcadia, Demeter had snakes twined in her hair or encircling her body and her chariot was drawn by snakes. Priestesses at the great oracle at Delphi were called Pythonesses, or snake women, and Clement of Alexandria wrote that a snake was the consecrated symbol of the Bacchic orgies. Snakes were kept in Apollo’s shrine at Epirus and fed by naked priestesses. They were said to be descended from Pytho and were playthings of the god.  <br>  <br>**Brahmanic Wedding Ceremonies**  <br>The male says, I am the sun, thou art the earth, let us wed.  <br>  <br>**The Mass**  <br>Mas was a Persian word for the Moon.  <br>  <br>**The Virgin Mary**  <br>The word Almah in the Bible was mistranslated to mean virgin, when it really meant unmarried mother.  <br>  <br>**August 15th**  <br>Sacred to the Virgin Mary. The day of her so called Assumption. In August the sign of Virgo, the Virgin disappears from view.  <br>  <br>**September 8th**  <br>This is the day of the Virgin’s birth. It is when the sign of Virgo can again be seen, after the sun has passed through the sign.  <br>  <br>**Spring Equinox**  <br>The Virgin was again honored in March at the vernal equinox, with the eating of hot cross buns.  <br>  <br>**Kronus Dismembering Uranus**  <br>Is another story about the moon and the 14 phases.  <br>  <br>**Osiris and 19**  <br>Osiris died on the seventeenth day of the month Aythr…when the sun entered the lower signs of the zodiac which symbolized the Underworld. On the nineteenth of the month the priests proclaimed that Osiris was found.  <br>  <br>**Sign of the Witness**  <br>Made with one arm pointing up and the other down.  <br>  <br>**108**  <br>Number of beads in the rosaries of Buddhists and Brahmins.  <br>  <br>**Kunti**  <br>Wife of the sun god in India. Similar to Kuin or Queen.  <br>  <br>**Klachan**  <br>Gaelic word meaning "stone." It is still used in the slang for going to the church.  <br>  <br>**Sexual Perfection**  <br>The Jews believed that only the sexually perfect were fit to serve the lord of generation and the Mosaic Laws provided that a man who was “wounded in the stones” emasculated or otherwise sexually imperfect could not serve as a priest, nor could he enter the house of the congregation. The extent to which the Biblical injunction regarding physical perfection of priests is observed today in the selection of Popes and is known only to higher ecclesiastics. |

                  _Historical myths were the Jews' speciality..._

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|---|As the foundations of Christianity continue to crumble under the weight of new evidence about its origins, the Establishment is all the more eager to conceal information that reveals the truth about those origins. As we have stated throughout our work, it has only been through a ruthless age-old campaign of suppression and confiscation that senior Church authorities have been able to perpetuate their Jesus fraud. We also insist that the intelligence operating from behind the Christian Church today is the _same_ that operates behind Judaism and Freemasonry. _Atonism_ was the sole originator of Judaism, Catholicism and Protestantism. It is the trunk from which most well-known monotheistic branches of religion grow.  <br>  <br>In order to conceal the true origins of Judaism and Christianity, theories are frequently put forward that speak of the "hidden origins" of religion. The vast majority of these theories focus on obscure, but often plausible, connections between Christianity and Judaism. Some theorists focus on little known connections between Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, and Gnosticism. Unlike hardliner literalists, Gnostic Jews and Christians regarded Jesus as a _spiritual_ archetype who did not physically exist. For this reason the Gnostics were opposed to the teachings of Jewish and Christian literalists who adamantly believed in an living incarnate Jesus. Literalists are responsible for selecting the Four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which present Jesus as a man as well as a god.  <br>  <br>In their book _Jesus and the Lost Goddess_, authors Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy theorize that the origin of Christianity was Gnostic Judaism and Paganism. Certain Jewish philosophers, they write, were deeply influenced by ancient Paganism and Gnosticism. They even contend that the Paganism which once influenced Jewish occult sects dates from the time of Moses.  <br>  <br>Of course, this piece of information is of great importance, particularly to those readers familiar with the works of Moustafa Gadalla, Ahmed Osman, Ralph Ellis, and previous scholars who knew full well that the original Moses was none other than Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaton, and that the so-called "Israelites" of the Old Testament were none other than the Hyksos People. (Sadly Freke and Gandy apparently know nothing of the theories of their contemporaries Gadalla, Osman and Ellis. This is betrayed by statements such as "The Exodus initiation allegory, which also appears to have no basis in actual history...")  <br>  <br>According to Freke and Gandy, Christianity as we know it was originally a fusion and adaptation of Jewish Gnosticism and Paganism. The hardliner literalist Christianity of later times split off from the egalitarian form that originally honored the goddess and permitted women equal status. Eventually, after their own Church grew in strength, the founders of the Latin form of hardliner literalist Christianity saw to it that Gnostics and esoterically minded Jewish sects were eradicated and their works destroyed. Literalists then tampered with the Gnostic traditions and writings, tweaking them to suit their own version of the Jesus story. According to Freke and Gandy, St. Paul was of a Gnostic persuasion. Unlike the Gospels, the works of Paul do not compel readers to accept and believe in a living incarnate Jesus. For Paul, Jesus was a spiritual archetype. Later, say Freke and Gandy, Paul's writings were tampered with to give them a hardliner complexion. (This is, however, not a theory that we personally accept. Our theories on Paul and the origins of Judaism and Christianity are presented in Volume Two of _The_ _Irish Origins of Civilization_.)  <br>  <br>Of course from one perspective the theories put forth by Freke and Gandy appear to answer many mysteries. They apparently answer the question of how so many pagan elements are to be found within the iconography and dogma of both Judaism and Christianity.  <br>  <br>However, as we advocate in our works _Astro-Theology and Sidereal Mythology_, and _The Irish Origins of Civilization,_ Christianity was not the product of Gnosticism, Stoicism, Judaism or some other Pagan sect. It was the creation of Egyptian Atonists whose peculiar form of solar worship became the basis both for Judaism and Christianity. Indeed, Ralph Ellis has shown that the very word "Judaism" directly refers to the Atonists of Egypt. So when authors such as Freke and Gandy speak about Christianity developing out of "Judaism," they fail to understand that the Judaism to which they refer is, in fact, little more than Egyptian Atonism. If Christianity and Judaism possess "pagan" leitmotifs, it is to Egypt that we must look for their origin.  <br>  <br>We do not doubt that there were egalitarian minds working within the early Christian Church. We do not deny that many Jewish and Christian philosophers and adepts working in Alexandria and Athens, were fascinated by paganism and ancient Egyptian mystery traditions. And we do not doubt that there are innumerable examples of plagiarism in Jewish and Christian scriptures. We know that these works could not exist without the influence of ancient esoteric doctrines. But we do not accept theories that labor to identify the hardliner, prohibitive, and ultimately destructive form of Christianity as merely a perverse branch of an earlier egalitarian and permissive version put together by well-meaning Jews, Pagans and Gnostics. We take exception to passages such as "Later the Jesus story fell into the hands of those with a more political agenda and became distorted and confused." _Later!_ Does this single word not exonerate the early Atonists who destroyed Egypt? Does it not exonerate the Christian Culdeans who ravaged Britain? Does it not imply that Judaism and Christianity was essentially pristine _before_ the rise of Constantine's Roman Church?  <br>  <br>In our opinion, believing theories of this kind _serves_ the duplicitous Christian establishment. Theories of this kind ultimately insinuate the idea that if only the hardliner version could be scaled back, men would be better off with the more pristine form of Judaism and Christianity known in earlier days. This is exactly the kind of false inference that Vatican agents hope for. This is because the Establishment has long been reconciled to the death of the hardliner punitive version of Christianity (or Atonism) that they has served them well for over two thousand years. They are quite prepared for Christianity Mark II to emerge in its place. The rise of a popular upgraded and updated version of Christianity does not threaten elite Atonists in the least, because it too is of their own invention. As we mentioned in Volume One of _The Irish Origins of Civilization_, regardless of whether we are speaking of the exoteric or the esoteric branches of Judaism and Christianity, we are speaking Atonism. And the Atonism remains regardless of what color the walls of its hideous temple are painted, or what sign is from time to time posted above its dark unhallowed doorway. In other words, in our opinion the same sinister hand works behind the literalist Papal schools of Christianity _and_ the permissive, egalitarian Gnostic schools.  <br>  <br>For this reason we must be somewhat cautious when reading books such as _Jesus and the Lost Goddess_. Even though books of this sort (of which there are many) contain valuable information, much of it accurate and revelatory, they also contain much to be wary of, information that not only leads us away from the true secrets of religion, but which, when accepted on face value, serves the powers that be  <br>  <br>     - Mtsar|---|

|---|**Western Culture Ravaged by Christians**  <br>...Christian Literalism, now the only legal religion in the Roman Empire, launched a brutal crusade to completely eradicate its old rivals, Christian Gnosticism and ancient Paganism. In an orgy of violence, armies of fanatical Christian Literalists tore down the architectural wonders of the Pagan world. They built infernal bonfires of books containing the spiritual wisdom and scientific knowledge of the ages. They subjected to grisly torture and a painful death philosophers, priestesses, and scientists - anyone who disagreed. They did not stop until they had cut the head off Western culture, leaving it to wander like an amnesiac in an ignorant stupor. They did not stop until they had cut the heart out of Western spirituality, bleeding it dry of its mystical vitality. The corpse of a religion which remained offered nothing but hope of a better afterlife in return for blind belief in its irrational opinions and unquestioning allegiance to power-crazed popes. This tyrannical empire of the soul extended the arm of the state right into the inner sanctum of every individual, denying the right to spiritual autonomy and compelling all to acquiesce or burn.  <br>  <br>**What is Christianity?**  <br>After years of painstaking research we concluded that the traditional history of Christianity was at best hopelessly inaccurate and at worst a pack of lies...  <br>  <br>...The evidence demanded that we think the unthinkable. Christianity was not the cult of a first-century Messiah, but a Jewish adaption of the ancient Pagan Mystery religion. We could find no evidence that there ever had been an historical Jesus, because the gospel story was a Jewish reworking of ancient Pagan myths of a dying and resurrected Son of God.  <br>  <br>Later the Jesus story fell into the hands of those with a more political agenda and became distorted and confused, but the underlying initiatory allegory which is its foundation remains.  <br>  <br>**The Therapeutae**  <br>We even ventured an informed guess as to who may have authored the original Jesus myth - a sect of mystical Jews called the Therapeutae.  <br>  <br>**Jewish Proto-Christians**  <br>Amongst some Jewish Gnostics a school developed which synthesized Jewish and Pagan mythology to produce distinctive new myths. In retrospect we can see that this was the beginnings of what we now call 'Christianity.'  <br>  <br>**Jewish Gnostics**  <br>Jewish Gnostics claimed to be inheritors of secret mystical teachings passed down from their own great Gnostic master, Moses. These teachings were so similar to those of Pagan Gnosticism that many Jews claimed that the great Pagan philosophers had originally received their wisdom from Moses. This belief encouraged Jews to enthusiastically embrace the philosophy and mythology of the Pagan Gnostics to augment their own tradition, producing a large number of spiritual treatises which synthesize Pagan and Jewish motifs...  <br>  <br>...The spirituality of the Therapeutae and Essenes is an example of this fusion of Jewish and Pagan Gnosticism.  <br>  <br>**Gnostic Judaism and the Cynics**  <br>Following the practice of the Cynic school of Pagan Gnosticism, these Jewish Gnostics called their spiritual tradition simply 'the Way' - a term also adopted by the original Christians.  <br>  <br>**Gnostic Jews, Plato, and Pythagoras**  <br>The Christian myth of descent or origination is a synthesis and elaboration of the Jewish Genesis myth and Timaeus, a Pythagorean treatise by the Pagan Gnostic Plato.  <br>  <br>**The Two Jesuses**  <br>The name 'Jesus' itself comes from Exodus. In Greek the Hebrew name 'Joshua' becomes 'Jesus.' Today it is normal practice to use 'Joshua' for the hero of Exodus and 'Jesus' for the hero of the gospels, which avoids any comparison of the two. At the time, however, it would have been completely obvious that they shared the same name.  <br>  <br>**Plagiarism in the Gospels**  <br>It has long been known to scholars, for example, that the entire passion narrative in the gospels has been created from motifs taken from Psalms 22, 23, 38, and 39 and from the depiction of the 'suffering servant' in the Book of Isaiah.  <br>  <br>**Jewish Master Forgers**  <br>Historical myths were the Jews' specialty. The Exodus initiation allegory, which also appears to have no basis in actual history, is written in the form of a pseudo-historical narrative. When Jewish Gnostics developed their new myth of Jesus the Jewish dying and resurrecting Godman, it was inevitable they would eventually also set this allegory in a historical context. As with the Exodus myth, the creators of the Jesus story mixed together mythical figures, such as Jesus and Mary, with a handful of historical figures which were also used to play symbolic roles in the initiation allegory. Unlike Exodus, the new Jesus myth could not be set in archaic times, because it was portrayed as a revelation of a new Messiah. It was set, therefore, in the recent past and incorporated figures who were important to Jewish Gnostics, such as the much revered John the Baptist and the much hated Pontius Pilate, the Roman ruler of Judea.  <br>  <br>At the end of the first century CE, when the original Christians were casting the Jesus myth in an historical setting, Israel was in deep crisis. Jews needed an explanation for the terrible events which were befalling them. In 70 CE the Jerusalem Temple, the very heart of Jewish Literalism, had been torn down by the Romans. By 135 CE the hole of Israel would be laid waste and cease to exist for 2,000 years. Jewish Gnosticism deliberately set the Jesus story in the years in which the crisis began.  <br>  <br>**Early Proto-Christian Sects**  <br>By the first half of the first century there were already three distinct schools of Christian Gnosticism, which suggests, once again that, in some form or another Christianity had been in existence for some time. These schools are the Simonians, Paulists and Ebionites. The issue which divided them was the relationship of Christianity to traditional Jewish religion. The Simonians were radical internationalists who rejected Judaism and its tribal deity Jehovah as redundant Literalist nonsense. The Paulists were also internationalists who wanted to free Christianity from close ties with Judaism, but took a more moderate view, seeing Christianity as fulfilling and therefore surpassing Judaism. The Ebionites were nationalists who saw Christianity as a specifically Jewish cult and wanted Christians to conform to traditional Jewish religious customs...None of these Christians were practicing Christianity as we would recognize it today. Christian Literalism, from which nearly all forms of modern Christianity have evolved, didn't begin to appear until the middle of the second century.  <br>  <br>**Book of Luke's Advice**  <br>...Despite the fact that in The Gospel of Luke Jesus teaches, 'Everyone when his training is complete will reach his teacher's level,' the Gnostic idea that Christianity was about oneself becoming a Christ became branded as blasphemous heresy.  <br>  <br>**The Literalist Fraud**  <br>There were no historical disciples. There were no early Literalists. They all had to be invented. The earliest Christian whose writings suggest he was a Literalist was Justin Martyr, c. 150. But even Justin still saw Christianity as a branch of philosophy and set up his own philosophical school in Rome.  <br>  <br>The traditional history of Christianity is that Literalist took the world by storm, whilst Christian Gnosticism remained a minor heretical fringe movement. This is nonsense.  <br>  <br>Christian Literalism was initially a minor school of Christianity which developed in Rome toward the end of the second century. By this time Christian Gnosticism was an international movement which had spread throughout much of the Mediterranean, flourishing in cosmopolitan cities such as Alexandria, Edessa, Antioch, Epheseus and Rome...There is no sign of any form of Christianity which resembles Roman Catholicism in Egypt until Bishop Demetrius at the end of the third century.  <br>  <br>Over the course of the third century, despite the flimsiness of its claims to be the authentic Christian lineage, Literalism grew in popularity in Rome and the West, though Eastern Christianity remained overwhelmingly Gnostic. Eventually, however, it was inevitable that the simplistic certainties and offer of vicarious atonement of Christian Literalism would attract more adherents than Christian Gnosticism, with its puzzling promise of Gnosis through mystical transformation.  <br>  <br>Christian Literalism was an ideal candidate...It was exactly what a Roman despot like Constantine required - a populist and authoritarian religion which had freed itself from Gnostic radicals.  <br>  <br>**Christian Literalism and the Old Testament**  <br>Literalist Christianity took as its scriptural backdrop the Jewish Old Testament, with its patriarchal monotheism.  <br>  <br>**Inherent Paganism**  <br>As Christian Literalism grew in power it adopted more of the trappings of the Pagan Literalism it replaced. Its ritual processions were identical to those of the Pagan cults. Although Jesus had specifically said, 'Call no man "father",' Christian Literalists adopted the Mithraic practice of calling priests 'father.' In imitation of the Mithraic bishops, Christian bishops wore a 'mithra' or 'mitre' and carried a shepherd's staff. Eventually the Bishop of Rome took up the title Pontifex Maximus, the ancient name for the Pagan high priest, a title still held by the Pope today.  <br>  <br>**School of Mani**  <br>The school of the third-century master Mani became a world religion in his own lifetime. Eventually reaching from Spain in the West to China in the East, Manicheism flourished for 1,000 years...His followers taught that 'Judaism, Paganism, Christianity, and Manicheism are one and the same doctrine.|---|

|---|**St. Peter (Capricorn)**  <br>The Church was laid on this the ‘First Apostle.’ But in astro-theological terms this apostle represented the sign of Capricorn, which is the first house of the calendar year, the place of the sun’s rebirth. _Upon this Rock I will build my Church._  <br>  <br>**Apostola Apostolorum**  <br>Meaning the "Apostle of Apostles," or the First Apostle, was a term used for Mary Magdalene.  <br>  <br>**Women of the Bible**  <br>…although women had not been minor characters in the primary Christian drama, Paul and his henchmen made sure that they would be pushed to the margin throughout history - (page 63)  <br>  <br>This can be confusing when it later seems that women suddenly appear from nowhere to take the central place around the cross - (page 63)  <br>  <br>It is said of Mary and the women around Jesus that they: "Ministered unto him of their substance" - (page 233)  <br>  <br>…it is of supreme importance that the person who anoints Jesus – marking him out for his true destiny – is a woman - (page 254)  <br>  <br>In the Synoptic Gospels the woman who anoints Jesus is not named, although they make the point that she is a sinner - (page 254)  <br>  <br>In Luke, the anointing woman is described as ‘a woman in the city, which was a sinner’ - (page 254)  <br>  <br>**At the Tomb**  <br>If we read that the women played a little role in the life of Jesus why is that they are the only ones to come around the tomb after the crucifixion - (page 260 )  <br>  <br>**Peter’s hatred**  <br>Let Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life - (Gospel of Thomas)  <br>  <br>**Horasis**  <br>The ritual of anointing in which the entire male body becomes a symbolic phallus, the column of Geb, ready for intercourse with the goddess - (page 260)  <br>  <br>**Spikenard**  <br>From a rare Indian plant was extremely expensive, and was known to be used only for ritual purposes, for the head and feet. It was also used for burial rites.  <br>  <br>**Burial Ritual**  <br>Mary of Bethany ‘Christ-ened’ Jesus with the Spikenard, an unguent that had very likely, been kept for that occasion, and was an ointment associated with burial rites. Jesus himself remarked of the anointing (Mark 14:8); ‘…she has come a forehand to anoint my body to the burying’. In his mind, at least, it was intended to be a ritual...the ceremony is hardly typical of Judaic practice - (page 256)  <br>  <br>**Mary as Lucifer**  <br>Mary was also called by Jesus, Mary Lucifer, Mary the Light-Bringer - (page 261)  <br>  <br>**Priestess**  <br>Significantly, the original word for such a priestess in _hierodule_, which means ‘sacred servant.’ The word ‘prostitute,’ with all its implied moral judgment, was a Victorian rendering. Moreover, this temple servant, is unlike the secular prostitute, acknowledged to be in control of the situation and the man who visits her, and both of them receive benefits in terms of physical, spiritual and magical empowerment - (page 257)  <br>  <br>**Isis Worship**  <br>Isis worship continued openly until the end of the fourth century, but its greatest  rival was Christianity…the Christians destroyed the Serpeum in Alexandria and took measures to suppress the cult whenever it was found. The last official Isian festival of the old days was celebrated in Rome in 394 - (page 298)  <br>  <br>**Morality of the Isis Cult**  <br>Jesus is perceived to be one person who almost invented compassion, love and altruism. Clearly, however, this is not the case: obviously there have always been good people from every culture and religion, but specifically the Isian religion of that time placed great emphasis on personal responsibilities and morality, on upholding family values and respect for all people - (page 341)  <br>  <br>…the Egyptians were not known as particularly licentious people, but were remarkable for their spirituality - (page 364)  <br>  <br>**New Appraisals**  <br>Archaeological discoveries such as the Nag Hammadi texts and the Dead Sea Scrolls have revealed much more about the time and culture in which Jesus lived - and suddenly it seems that many of the aspects of Christianity that used to be considered unique were no such thing. Even the most well-worn familiar Christian concepts can now be seen as having had a completely different meaning in the context of first-century Palestine.  <br>  <br>That the New Testament analysis as we know it only began in the nineteenth century reflects the almost superstitious reluctance to examine the original texts that came out of the Church’s age-long prohibition on Bible reading for the masses. For centuries only priests read the Scriptures – in fact, in most cases they had the monopoly of literacy.  <br>  <br>**Sexual Repression**  <br>The consequences of the Church’s attitude to sex and sexual love for our culture have, as we have seen, been terrible repression on such a scale has been responsible, not only for personal torment and unnecessary soul-searching, but also for countless crimes against women and children – many of which the authorities have chosen to ignore.  <br>  <br>In its fervor to establish itself as the one and only religion, Christianity has always waged war on pagans. Temples were destroyed and people tortured and killed, from Iceland to South America, from Ireland to Egypt, in the name of Jesus Christ. Yet if we are right, and Jesus himself was a pagan, then this Christian fervor was not only once again a denial of common humanity, but also of their founder’s own principles.  <br>  <br>**Jesus as "Lord"**  <br>This has been proven to be merely a common title of respect, given even from children to parents, etc,.  <br>  <br>**Dead Sea Scrolls**  <br>…there is no proof that the Scrolls themselves were of Essene origin – that was simply the immediate assumption when they were found.  <br>  <br>**Jesus the Carpenter**  <br>This comes from the Aramaic word _naggar_, which means scholar or learned man.  <br>  <br>**Council of Nicea**  <br>In 325 AD, they decided to leave out over fifty legitimate works and keep only four.  <br>  <br>**Heresy**  <br>A word that means ‘choice.’|---|

|---|**Holy Grail**  <br>Sir Thomas Mallory, author of the fifteenth-century _Morte d’Arthur_, was the first to use the words ‘Holy Grail’ and said that the Sangkreal was the blessed blood of Christ. But in his English Etymology, Walter Skeat (1833-1912), one of the greatest investigators of the roots of the English language, states that the etymology of the Holy Grail ‘was very early falsified by an intentional change from San Greal (Holy Dish) to Sang Real (Holy Blood)…We found that such misinterpretations, or deliberate falsifications, have appeared ever since the Grail’s ancient origins.'  <br>  <br>**Fisher King, and Lucifer**  <br>Lucifer…is another alchemical reference. In Old French, _luce_ means ‘fish,’ as does the Latin word _locus_.  <br>  <br>**John (Aquarius/Pisces)**  <br>Oannes comes from the Philistine fish god. The word John comes from this.  <br>  <br>**Dagon**  <br>In the Talmud, we have _dagh_, meaning fish. This gives dagon, and Dagda, the all-father. It also gives Daddy.  <br>  <br>**Newts**  <br>The Jews used the symbol of a newt’s tail to inscribe the letter Yod.  <br>  <br>**Pendragon**  <br>May derive from _pendryvan_ or _pendravan_, the word for newt. The word also connoted fiveness, and also contains pen, meaning “head.”  <br>  <br>**John the Baptist**  <br>He was known as the Great Nazar, and _El Khidr_ meaning the "Green Man.”  <br>  <br>**Bacchus**  <br>He bore the same title as Jesus, the "fish.”  <br>  <br>**Cross**  <br>Comes from the Latin word _ceras_, which also means “serpent.”  <br>  <br>**The Cross**  <br>In Chinese the symbol character mag is a cross, and that referred to the magician.  <br>  <br>**Cadmus**  <br>God of the alphabet. He was worshiped as a serpent.  <br>  <br>**Ninazu**  <br>Sumerian god of healing called “Lord of Physicians.” His son’s symbol was the double-headed snake.  <br>  <br>**Chi Ro**  <br>A term given to Jesus, seems related to _cheiro_ meaning “snake-handler” and which is one part of the name Ophiuchus, based on Aesculapius or Imhotep.  <br>  <br>**Avalon**  <br>Island of the apples, from _avla_.  <br>  <br>**Brigit**  <br>Brigit was keeper of the orchards. The original Lady of the Lake.  <br>  <br>**Eve**  <br>From the Hebrew _Havvah_, meaning serpent.  <br>  <br>The figure of Eve is based upon much older mythology and may be traced back to the ancient Mother Goddess or World Mother and the serpent cults of the pre-Biblical period. Closer examination of the name ‘Eve’ revealed her serpent origins, for the Hebrew for Eve is _havvah_, meaning ‘mother of all things,’ but also ‘serpent.’ Likewise, the Arabic words for ‘snake,’ ‘life,’ and ‘teaching,’ are closely related to the word or name “Eve.’  <br>  <br>**Stonehenge**  <br>The stones originated in Naase Ireland, a place-name connoting the serpent.  <br>  <br>**Thor**  <br>His other name was _Adar_, near to _Adder_. He was also known as Sigg.  <br>  <br>**Kukulkan**  <br>Ku – meaning God, from _Kan_ meaning serpent.  <br>  <br>**Knights of Rhodes**  <br>They were great healers. Rhodes was said to have become the new Alexandria.|---|

|---|**King John**  <br>What if it can be shown that John was only among the last of a long line of vassal kings who bowed the knee to Rome and saddled upon the people of Britain a responsibility for institutes which they had no hand in framing and which were utterly opposed to their racial aptitudes and tendencies?  <br>  <br>**Emperor Demetrius**  <br>He planted an army of wives, concubines, slaves, and catamites in the Parthenon, which he “so polluted with his debaucheries that it appeared to be kept comparatively clean when he indulged himself only with such abandoned creatures as Lamia, Demo, and Antieyra.” He bestowed upon his principal wife the sacrilegious name of Dei-damia, or the Spouse of God.   <br>  <br>**Carthage**  <br>After the downfall of Carthage, Rome, whose dominion had hitherto been restricted to Italy and Greece, rapidly became a continental power.  <br>  <br>**Why Catholicism?**  <br>To keep together so vast an empire, to assimilate under one government such heterogeneous populations as had recently been brought under its sway; to command the respect of distant kings; to curb the ambition and repress the avarice of proconsuls who had become mightier than kings; and to preserve the private fortunes that had been carved out of the dying republic; some greater elements of power and authority and some more efficacious means of subordination were required to be wielded at Rome that those which had failed in the hands of Sylla and Pompey.  <br>  <br>The additional powers and discipline which for these reasons were needed to maintain the ascendancy of Rome were found in the peculiar organization and privileges of the Sacred College and in the mysteries of religion. These the ambitious and unscrupulous Caesar hastened to seize with the office of high-priest and the assumption of sacerdotal powers, which, in proportion as they exceeded the attributes of earthly kings, rivaled those of gods. To this discipline and subordination was added that moral influence which the church alone could wield, the influence of blind faith, of religious myths and superstition, the respect for ecclesiastical displeasure, the fear of committing sacrilege, and the dread of excommunication and anathema. These are elements of power and government which no statesman in any age, can afford to despise, and which we may feel assured were not permitted to lie unused by so profound a politician as Julius Caesar.  <br>  <br>**Winter Solstice BC 48**  <br>Julius Caesar is deified at the Temple of Jupiter Ammon. He was now the Son of God.  <br>  <br>**Caesar Augustus**  <br>When the tremendous commotion caused by the death of Julius Caesar had spent itself in civil wars, and in the firm establishment of the Messianic religion and ritual, Augustus ascended the sacred throne of his martyred sire and was in turn addressed as the Son of God, whilst Julius was worshiped as the Father. The flamens of the Sacred college erected and consecrated to the worship of Julius Caesar a magnificent temple in Rome…they organized a body of priests called the Julii, or the Juliani. These priests were selected from the most ancient order, the Luperci.  <br>  <br>**Emperor Tiberius**  <br>He refused to be deified as a god. Declaring himself to be mortal he was upbraided.  <br>  <br>**You Must Die!**  <br>When Caesar was assassinated, Augustus was still in his teens…One of the first acts of Augustus was the destruction of Perugia, a city which refused to acknowledge his authority. The fall of this place was followed by the sacrificial placation of Julius the Father. In this atrocious rite…the consul, Lucius Anthony (brother of Marc), besides Cannutius C. Flavius, Clodius Bithynicus, and the principal magistrates and council for Perugia, together with 300 senators and knights, were immolated as human sacrifices, upon the altar of Julius, erected for the occasion. The greater part of the abominable auto da fe was executed in the presence of Augustus himself, whose only reply to those who implored and shrieked for mercy, was; “You must die.”  <br>  <br>**The Real Massacre of the Innocents**  <br>When, before the Nativity, the divine oracle at Velitre predicted that “Nature was about to bring forth a prince over the Roman people,” the Senate passed an Act, A.U. 692, ordering that, “No male child born that year should be reared or brought up.” Thus, every boy born within the Roman pale was devoted to destruction, and a frightful Slaughter of Innocents would have ensued, had not those who expected children, removed the tablets of the law from the walls of the aerarium; and thus defeated the atrocious act.  <br>  <br>**Feudalism**  <br>…we trust to be able to show that the feudal system was connected and necessarily connected with the church; that it was a development of the Sacred constitution of the Roman Empire and legally expired with it; that it began with that constitution and its requirements; that it existed long before the establishment of the military tenures referred to…that feudal estates of land were not founded upon military services, but on the inalienability of lands belonging to the church.  <br>  <br> **Strange Separatism of the Emperors**  <br>The deified Julius appears in his statues and coins covered with a veil. Augustus was repeatedly absent in the provinces, whence he returned to Rome in a secret manner. In the city he dwelt in a retired portion of his palace, a lofty chamber, which he called the Syracuse, and he commonly supped alone.  <br>  <br>**Government by Proxy**  <br>To the last, the emperors of Constantinople lived in seclusion, governed the empire by proxy, and were to be approached only with difficulty, mystery and the most servile homage.  <br>  <br>**Hierarchies of Control**  <br>The exclusive relations thus established between the sacred monarch and the nobles or priests who surrounded his person, soon came to be repeated between those nobles and the rank next below them…Another barrier between the artificially exalted monarch and the artificially degraded people, another social rank thus had to be formed; and so it went on, until the lowest substratum of the civil order was reached...This is called the “Involution of rank.” No Gothic chieftain ever ruled by proxy.   <br>  <br>**Church Power**  <br>In the reign of Augustus some dying persons provided by will that an offering should be made to the church in gratitude for the signal favor that the Son of God, as they esteemed their emperor, had appeared on earth during their lifetime. From these and other superstitious sources the pagan church acquired immense landed estates in every part of the empire. These estates were worked by slaves.  <br>  <br>**Power Families of Rome**  <br>Anciani  <br>Bassi  <br>Paulini  <br>Gracchi  <br>  <br>**The Barbarians**  <br>…the barbarians did not receive Christianity as a gift from on high. To them it was a phase of the imperial power, and they never accepted it peacefully, nor without a valuable consideration. They had to be lured into it, coaxed or cajoled into it, tempted into it, married into it, bribed into it, or else forced into it. In all efforts the Church had to yield something of principle in return. The Christianity, as well as the Imperialism, of this period wore many coats, and underwent many mutations.|
