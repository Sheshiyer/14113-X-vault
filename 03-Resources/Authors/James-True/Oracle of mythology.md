[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] good morning everybody Welcome to the second day of Astron nois 2 it's going to be just as sizzling there was a time when you had no choice but to listen to your
[00:13] bones and the cave of Patriarchs is uh probably the perfect example of that it turns out that the second most uh reverent site in the world is holding bones and I think that the fact that
[00:26] Sarah Isaac Jacob uh Rebecca Leah all of them are in the same place because all of the information that we could ever want to know is there that's because your body is an
[00:41] oracle of Mythology and truth lies deep inside you and it's holograph out into the world in a firmament of synchronicity you feel this synchronicity and they scare the [ __ ]
[00:54] out of you it scares you so much that you push the truth of the world deep down inside you until you build an identity that can face
[01:09] it you are here or here or here I just want to remind you all that the concept of the Soul has been crafted and I think kind of congealed at a time before
[01:24] electricity the time before wireless communication that we all decided in our ancestors what the soul was before we even understood what a radio signal is and I think Now's the Time as modern
[01:38] gnostics if we can say that if we can call ourselves that to to reinvent the soul using what we understand now instead of back then what we know now is the body is a
[01:51] filament and you were submerged in an atmosphere of plasma and your posture is indicative of your charge it's not your attitude it's your charge you have an electrical
[02:03] attitude inside of you Consciousness I put forth is the beholding of awareness you behold your
[02:16] awareness when you're conscious and to recognize one as Consciousness you must cognize the awareness more than once the first moment you notice you are conscious you do not know you're
[02:30] conscious it requires two moments to recognize the fact that you are conscious so memory itself is more important than we may think Consciousness is the awareness of
[02:42] persistent memory light is the awareness of information darkness is the unawareness of information I wish I could use ignorant but we don't like the word ignorant now
[02:58] we don't like that because we come from a time when we do not like to admit we don't know things mystery is my favorite mistress and she scares the [ __ ] out of most men including
[03:10] me we don't discover the world we remember it and forget it and remember it and forget it this is called read write create and every single application on a computer has the
[03:24] ability to do just that so how does it work to be thoughtful I want you to hear I'm saying thoughtful to be thoughtful is to
[03:37] remember someone to remember someone is to keep a record written in potassium th records your first memory inside the zygote at the moment of your first osmosis it draws the waters into itself
[03:52] and these Waters give it the first salt which gives it the first ability to record what happened this is th and we have a tradition of
[04:05] saying th gave us the ability to remember because thth gave us the ability to remember we see these things we just don't tangibly touch them but
[04:17] they're there and we know this is gnosticism wisdom is that which is remembered Osiris is resting there's a baby there's the placent and the placenta gains something it
[04:32] didn't have before the placenta gains the ability to store memory this is why we have the stor it is this is why we associate the stor with a new life it's because the new
[04:46] life is the first memory of Consciousness so we announce a new baby with thought but we call it a stor so what is the soul I say to you whoops that the soul is
[05:00] coaxil I'd like you to imagine that every single connection that you have in the world is going to have two different ports and you've got a positive and negative you've got an intake and an outtake and that you are having a
[05:13] co-axial connection with the sun with Source I'm not asking you to worship the sun I just want you to know that when you stare into the Sun the reason why it hurts is because you're downloading
[05:25] information it's so fast it's burning a hole in your rouder this is a melano site melanocyte produces melanin melanin
[05:40] absorbs electricity melanin absorbs information all of you have pigments in your skin to absorb information I did not say digest I said absorb melanin protects you from
[05:55] information I could say so much more about this but there's just too much to do but mental note check it out it's a huge huge subject that means that
[06:07] atheism is privacy from God and this is very important we invented atheism to create privacy from God because only in privacy do we understand who we are if we knew God was watching we wouldn't
[06:23] play with ourselves we wouldn't feel shame we wouldn't feel remorse it is with the privacy of atheism that we are able to discover who we are which means that
[06:34] atheism theism and even scientism are all simply infl inflammatory responses we have to source and when you look at the world today everyone is living in an
[06:48] inflammatory State they have a uh DEC cardian view of materialism precisely because it's comfortable to have that so so let's go
[07:00] back let's think about what this really means when you were a zygote there was a time when you made your first memory what do you think that would be
[07:14] like when you have no concept of anything at all in the beginning there was only the one the father illimitable since there is nothing before it to limit it unfathomable since
[07:27] there is nothing before it to measure it it is unmeasurable it is invisible you guys know this quote and for the first time I maybe not the first time but for the first time for some of you I'd like for you to consider that this is the
[07:41] conceptual understanding when you were inside this world that you as the zygote are rendering your world from the moment you're allowed to record your thoughts so what did that look
[07:57] like the Gnostic text explains it saw its own reflection so what did the zygote do the zygote inside the womb looks at the
[08:10] waters and sees itself and it gets chills because it's never seen itself before and that moment that it saw itself for the first time was a huge
[08:22] colossal turn in its understanding of who and what it is this memory is pronoia or barbello and the concept of forethought
[08:35] is the concept of memory persisting over thought that that first concept of forethought was an invention because before the first forethought there was no such thing as forethought and that
[08:48] was huge it represented a giant leap in your Consciousness and why you're here I have to go over this this part quickly but I would like for you to imagine and research on your own that
[09:02] the story of the Titans is meosis the Titans have a tale that tells you that they were split by cutting their arms kids would come out cutting their heads kids would
[09:17] come out this is the process of meosis which is different than mitosis it's a very different processes meosis is a cleaving it would be taking me and dividing myself into two would maintain
[09:29] the same space but I would be two myosis would be to split me save my space and another would form right very different concepts and if you think about what the Titan story is telling you it's explaining to you
[09:44] meosis and it came long before we knew what meosis existed this is what I mean Zeus is cleaved in the head and out
[09:58] comes something different but that difference is who he is and that's Athena every single one of the Titans is a metic I don't even think that's a word but a
[10:11] meosis kind of uh kind of kind of Life epen epigenetics your epigenetics is a Wi-Fi password to your
[10:24] family Network that simply by having the Wi-Fi password all the information is available to you to download from Source right all of us can go to Google all of us get a different
[10:38] page same kind of concept here just as barbello had asked the one to give her new aons the son asked to be given another mind the father and mother
[10:52] agreed mind arose and glorified its father and mother right so you can start to understand this process the gnostics knew exactly what was happening and they didn't know it through science they
[11:07] understood it through intuition something about them their life had this information but there was no physical place that they could point to where it came
[11:22] from Truth Hurts truth hurts right gnostics know the language that we use we know we understand we know exactly what's going
[11:35] on I will most of my career involves me telling people that are listening to me something that they don't want to hear and them saying I don't want to hear you anymore this is the heart of truth truth
[11:50] is never easy truth is a download that must be decompressed and to decompress it you're going to need a certain amount of desktop space a certain amount of processing power Soul as source is an antenna not only well we see so little
[12:11] the spectrum because the spectrum is poisonous to your delicate senses think about it it's not a coincidence that infrared microwaves and radio waves are more dangerous it's not a coincidence that ultraviolet X-rays and gamma rays
[12:24] are more dangerous you're a filament and you can burn out and you burn out under the threat of too much information information right this is why we see such a tiny
[12:38] portion we have Fidelity which is good not bad what we see is an attempt to resolve a sensory puzzle that we've been laying out on the table since the day we're born and no one's giving us Clues
[12:53] there's not a box that shows us what it looks like right we're just doing the best we can what if I told you that we render reality inside Plato's Cave what if I told you that melanin and dopamine were
[13:08] used as paintbrushes to paint inside your eyes what if I told you that the amydala itself decides what your eyeball is going to render based on how much it would put you into shock that a deer in
[13:21] the headlights a possum plain dead a goat that faints all are showing you something that you are built in you have a built-in governor and the governor is the amydala the Magdalene as we will
[13:35] see soon some of you going to freak out because you never noticed this but why is there no commandment against lying to yourself but commandment nine no no no
[13:50] commandment nine says I cannot lie about you or you doesn't Why didn't it just say thou shalt not lie do you know how hard it was to carve this stuff right you need to
[14:04] lie I need to lie it's literally how we can stay in the world we lie to ourselves every moment we lie to each other every moment I'm lying to you right now look at this I'm all dressed up you didn't see me yesterday right
[14:20] we're supposed to lie it's one of the most creative Powers we have it's so creative that the place where we lie whoops that the place where we lie in
[14:33] the brain is the same place where we heal that Placebo and lying are the same thing exact same process and this is an important part of your creative Matrix
[14:46] you have the creative ability to form a sonar bubble of reality and everyone's going to tell you whether or not they believe it too that's a closer definition of what real really is I think
[15:00] think about it every field of professional study has fraud at the top look at these numbers right 30 billion everything is fraud and when you
[15:13] grow up you you many of us don't even come past the fact that that's bad news this is good news this is good news it's showing you how important the plasma of belief is for us to
[15:27] survive and thank goodness oh thank goodness that this betrayal fell to the reverence of Mythology if it were not for our reverence to myth to keep mythology pure
[15:41] all of this stuff would be covered up mythology would be full of of equality of of affirmative action there would be literally no way to even tell stories edus Rex are you kidding how are you do
[15:54] you even convey that to anyone this is why I call it the Oracle of Mythology there are two rules very simple one the truth is always in the
[16:07] room always always number two we dress the truth depending on how hard it is to swallow
[16:18] always no exceptions you can use these tools to discern reality you can see a lie and understand exactly what's on the the other side of it the LIE gives you more about the person who's lying to you
[16:33] than the truth the LIE tells you what they're ashamed of what they're insecure about what they're unsure of and that gives you more information in a way a lie is exposing the heart and only some
[16:47] of us know how to listen this is the purpose of oracles it's why we travel thousands of miles to see a virgin on a tripod it's why it survived for thousands of years
[17:04] right I'd like to show you this Oracle now you've already seen many examples I'm going to be jumping around a lot and I hope you understand that it's just back to this concept of the Oracle of Mythology let's start here in
[17:18] America it is is it a coincidence that the eagle is associated with the Aztec Soldier and the American serviceman is this quote an Aztec
[17:32] quote or an American Marine quote the point is is it's hard to tell it's an Aztec quote this is a thank you for your service in Aztec world the same Mantra is being
[17:47] repeated and it's coming up from the soil Temple mayor blue God red God God of rain God of War
[18:03] right anyone see any parallels with our current political system I'm sure it's a coincidence it's just a coincidence are you getting our system's so so uh stable right why is
[18:16] the plume serpent found in Egypt what's going on there why do we have the same flum serpent in two different places keep in mind I'm not the person that's going to tell you they secretly communicated but all of Academia didn't notice that's not what
[18:32] I'm saying at all I'm telling you the Oracle mythology is there and it resonates through the synchronicity of the scaffolding around you binary code is remembered not
[18:46] invented the union is at the heart of us all we were destined to be using ones and zeros because the Oracle and mythology told us so what is this it's a one and a zero
[19:00] right and we we consider that the most sacred Bond the bringing forth of the one and the zero we're going to get shameful and dirty now I'm sorry I need you to understand the shame
[19:15] that you may feel by watching this is exactly what I need to convey to you it's actually part of understanding why we will hide the truth because it's too shameful to understand
[19:28] o used to be sworn on the phus in the very beginning all of our belief went into the preus and these are just a few of the ripples that are still
[19:40] left we still have these Concepts today we used to worship Stones you used to go to the Parthenon and watch a girl who had been picking olives all day uh squeeze them
[19:54] put them into a liquid and stroke a giant Pole that was literally the birth of church and that's the beginning of preus but we don't know that because we're ashamed of it and that shame is a good
[20:09] thing this is I'm probably pronouncing right but this is a a Bel belight or this one says Bim but it's Bight and this is our first fetish when I say first you're someone's going to say I'm
[20:23] wrong that's fine but this is one of the earliest versions that we found where we started to fetishize what considered to be God and we would see these things in the ocean and go holy jez what's going on what is and we started to worship
[20:35] that why that why was the Egyptian god men associated with these guys right this phallic symbol which carries over to here which actually could be an
[20:49] umbilical but you're going to have to invite me back so I can tell you about that but that entire system is the Oracle of Mythology we found opalized segments of these and
[21:02] said oh this is this is even more God than the last one look at this thing and we sprouted we wanted to give God legs but we couldn't walk yet our
[21:16] Consciousness was not strong enough for God to walk God remained in the sea because you and I didn't have enough plasma to animize him onto the land all the salt
[21:28] in the ocean allows us to tap into that and keep God in a gestation chamber and so we did and so we
[21:42] did and so we did and this morning I worshiped her today at 500 am in arrais i i the key I want you to
[21:57] understand about brais is that we began to grow Consciousness enough that we could insert belief into letters this was a huge move we could now draw a
[22:11] letter and and like stick our plasma inside it and when you go see that letter you're like oh there's Plasma in that letter and that's and that was a huge move that was huge this is why we started with
[22:25] talismans the earliest church was worn on the wrist was a Talisman we didn't have enough plasma to put it in a building we had to carry it on our person because it needed us as a battery to stay alive this is the technology of
[22:41] belief these are more what happened is a conglomeration pipus turned into a [ __ ] do you see it pipus turned into a [ __ ] why because it was less shameful who's that guy over there his name's Bob
[22:56] he's pretty cool he works worship a preus though I don't think he's right for our family well John over here he worships he worshiped this guy right can you see the the politeness
[23:11] coming through this is how we lose mythology because everyone's got to be so polite all time and this is the birth of the all God and we we'll come back to this
[23:23] concept because from this we went from a brais to to gpan to pan to Capricorn to baffet just wait on the bomet I'll get there but this has been a a model of
[23:37] coming out of the water we have a concept of evolution because God evolved and yahwe for the first time grew little feet and now Yahweh can walk and look how short they are you see it's
[23:52] just all he could do is Shuffle I Am the Only God I am the only one right the Ark of the Covenant the ark the rod of Aaron two stone
[24:10] tablets the first Trinity right the female and the male United it's the Ark of the Covenant the
[24:24] ank the uh the and the Yoni the rod and the Almond it's all the same binary code before we had computers the Ashira pole a mixing of
[24:38] male and female I have blessed you Yahweh Samaria and Ashira the Tower of Babel translates to migdal migdal is another word for almond inside the Ark
[24:52] of the Covenant is an almond branch and two stones two very specific right it's never one stone it's two the Tower of battle is the
[25:07] preservation of Life the Tower of migdal is the preservation preus rises in the migdal tower of migdal right pipus rises in the
[25:23] Almond early churches were so dirty oh my God they were so dirty they were so dirty we don't even have records anymore we don't even have records anymore they were shameful they were hidden away and we missed it all that
[25:39] the first churches were brel of worship and that that's literally what was required to bring someone together I want to remind you I'm not making this up virgins would gather olives squeeze it into a paste
[25:52] and juice and stroke a pole and people would come for thousands of miles to go hey let's go to the pole the pole I don't know what they call it Jeremiah 111 moreover the word of the
[26:06] Lord came unto me saying Jeremiah what seest thou and I said I see a rod of an almond tree twins everything in mitosis and meosis is the twinning of something and within our cosmology we have a huge
[26:24] world of twins I could probably show you 7 slides just on this but I'm not because there's too many to do but if you'd like to look into that yourself I think you'll find it's not a coincidence that twins are such an important part of
[26:37] our early uh history that we're simply broadcasting something we've already known of course the 12 Titans were twins all of them had this similar kind of notion where they would seem to Spring forth from the body parts of
[26:53] another again just like neosis literally the founders of Rome or twins so something happened preus got a little bit too tall got a little bit too big for his
[27:10] Bridges and with that man gained a luxury and that luxury I call shame that shame is a luxury it's an electrical luxury that you have and there was a time when we didn't have shame in fact we're living in a world
[27:26] where some people don't and you see how that operates you see what that what that gets us the truth is is that this story of Jack and Gil actually goes back to the time where
[27:40] we were looking for cloistered nuns and in a time of syphilis if you could find a place that had a cloistered nun your chances of not getting syphilis in that nunnery were pretty good the
[27:54] entire pisan idea of waiting for a house was the concept of letting the magdalin wait for an entire month to
[28:06] cleanse themselves of all the sin that was brought into them in the prior month and thank goodness we developed this concept that you and I have this concept
[28:22] that anything from here to here universally is shameful and Courtney you have more right and that we all have these different portions of our body that we universally accept shame is there and if you could
[28:36] see the electrical field and welcome to Aquarius because you can you can see it right now because I'm lying to you in this part because Aquarius is the seeing of
[28:47] energy that was already there the flow is now seen because we understand it why do we understand it we can afford to to look at source if you want to catch more on this
[29:01] preus stuff um it's a great article two essays on the worship of pipus one of which is an interesting anecdote that I can find no no trace of it could be that he made it up or it could be that Academia decided we're not
[29:16] going to mention that anymore but a cash of 4,000 buried fallaces were once found in Rome so what happened out we get from 4,000 fallaces found in a Roman orgy pit to the Lord is
[29:31] my shepherd I shall not want that's a big jump man that is a big jump and why because we flipped priapus we took Shame Shame Rose from priapus and became the top it's a
[29:46] beautiful beautiful transition that we've done this is why the pulpit is basically the male and female organs combined this is the n and the Christ

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
30:02] o this is why Peter is crucified upside down his name Peter pus right his name is telling you what happened that our Oracle of Mythology had to record this somewhere
[30:17] and Peter fit the bill and so no matter what actually happened to Peter what I think the truth is is that no matter what actually happened to Peter we put him in a lane that fits our story as we do with all archetypes every archetype
[30:32] in the world is forced to fit and preus is still falling not only have we developed a giant uh industry for Viagra but even that industry is falling
[30:46] too this is the end of preus this is a desperate attempt we got to keep pre us up we got to keep pre us up we got to keep pre us oh [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it [ __ ] it now no no no I didn't mean to pun on that one that
[31:03] was people will argue about this I'm not a scholar I have a ba I don't think that even counts so through my lips but Elohim yolked to a singular Spirit over
[31:17] the waters the zygote is a singular Spirit over the waters and there's a reason why Elohim is
[31:29] plural zygote is the first cell of a new animal that contains a whole set of genetic material that there's a point in your life where everything you needed was one was the monad
[31:48] um in the beginning there was the one the father actually not going to read this because we have slides I know you guys have heard this before but there it is the Flaming sword in the Garden of Eden
[32:02] I want to remind you that we did not have microscopes we were not able to look at a fertilized egg and that for whatever reason we knew a long time
[32:13] ago that an egg was guarded by a flaming sword and at the moment of conception you'll forgive me the video isn't starting where I wanted it to but it will but at the moment of conception um an egg is
[32:27] uh lit with zinc that a zinc discharge occurs that a flaming sword is placed on that egg and a chimera is camped outside telling everyone else this
[32:40] Garden's taken buddy the virgin's not home and that we knew that before we knew that the father gazed into barbello and she conceived by him she gave birth to a spark of light similar to The Father's
[33:01] light this was the son who was also called autogenous self-generated since he was at bottom identical with the father he was further called Christ a name greater than every
[33:12] name that the son being born is your very first cell your very first cell that you made inside you that after meosis you gained
[33:25] enough power to MiFi a Son of God and this entire story is reflecting that this is a picture of the son of man
[33:38] 10 days old looking pretty dapper Enoch was the great male his name means great scribe the original copy Enoch was the ideas of Enoch tell you that he was uh
[33:56] in corruptible that he was pure in spirit and that he was taken he didn't die he was taken I think the reason why he was taken he didn't die is because the RNA
[34:10] transcription that takes place inside your cells every day takes place from the Enoch and that that Enoch is used to copy the next RNA transcription and what is the RNA
[34:23] transcription what what is actually happening when an RNA is copying itself it's saying I am I am I am I am I am I am I am as fast as it can that it's being fed through the loop and it's
[34:35] listening to itself say I am and it is describing who it is and in inserting it into the next one this is the formation of the Elohim in
[34:50] Genesis the blasticus creates the Titan walls the Titan builds the city City the Cyclops forges all these great tools and then he's
[35:05] gone and we have all these stories of the Cyclops being simpletons how could you have great power and be a simpleton it's because you were here when the Elohim was just for me the Elohim said we will create a
[35:19] city wall and that City wall will give us will give us life this is the Garden of Eden the garden's being tempted and the serpent enters the
[35:40] garden and gives an apple once it gets inside it gives Eve an apple and what does Eve do she bites the apple and she's cast out of the
[35:55] garden what what's in the garden the garden is uh the zygote without I mean the egg is lacks no male chromosome it's the only time in the body where you have a place where there's missing
[36:07] chromosomes this serpent fulfills that and that's why you have to leave that's why we're cast out of the garden right the tree of good and evil or the blood vessels that enter into the ovary the
[36:21] forbidden fruit is the liberated ovam that hatches from the Tree of what life think about it Tree of Life red tree of knowledge
[36:34] blue why is blue tree of knowledge think about it what did the blood learn by giving itself to the capillary as it returns to the heart what are the lessons that it thinks about what information is it bringing
[36:48] back to the heart to say you're not going to believe what happened to me right so all of this was known before it was known all of this
[37:03] was pregnancy looks like mitosis this is the very Act of separating life which takes us to Egypt placenta
[37:22] placenta carac where's carac all right K act's on here somewhere and that you were watching the birth of the of the newborn king the new
[37:37] son attached to the placenta and you're about to see just how far this analogy goes there's a reason why Egypt has these things and this is going to sound weird but you're
[37:51] Gnostic so I think you can handle it would like for you to imagine for a moment that you render your world would like for you to imagine that in order for you to install the mythology of placenta the truth has to be in the room
[38:06] and the truth has to be in the room that everyone can have a placenta and that's what Egypt is we have rendered our placenta in a place we call
[38:18] Egypt that the world that we think is the world is a rendered mythology that we broadcasted and shared with everyone around us this is
[38:31] reality this is why Out of Africa the land of the black the mystery this is why there's white a White Chapel actually up here the white umbilical cord there's so many things that tie into this and I don't even necessarily
[38:45] think that you would have to be conscious of them as you're building these places if you built them because I think they were rendered the bed of Egypt I have a new book called The Ark of baet
[38:59] it's going to explain what I'm going to try and cover here much better how does the night's Templar a group in quest for the Grail end up worshiping a
[39:12] baet and a lot of that has to do with shame that when you're living in a world that's so overcome by shame it becomes necessary to create a secret society and that inside that secret society you were sworn to an oath where you can be
[39:26] authentic with each other and that it required to be authentic with each other you would have to walk into the room and kiss a stuffed goat's head simply to prove to the other people that you're you can get past the shame and you can
[39:41] have a real conversation about gnosticism all we know of gnosticism is ridicule every single piece of literature that we've read on narcism is
[39:52] basically ridicule the truth is always in the room and anytime you find ridicule in history you're seeing a giant nugget you've struck gold and you have to get through the shame you have to get through the hate you have to get
[40:06] through the Prejudice to find it bamed is not going away and there's a reason why this is canum looks kind of similar to baet it's a creator of the bodies of human
[40:22] children the Lord have created things from himself very important Point here at dendara the bamet spins Adam on a wheel the bathat or canoe not saying they called him bathat I'm the
[40:37] only one calling him bat just so you know I don't want to not trying to say Egypt has been telling you it's bathat the whole time but I want you to see why baffet uh I mean b this is a banab jedit
[40:51] and bandup jedit was the four the foreheaded Ram or or would we'll call him ramod but he was actually based in meny's he was based in the center of the placenta okay a little bit different
[41:05] you're about to see why canum was in carac down below where the
[41:14] king's born one head while the bab jedit was uh was up in the placenta up top this is the original Lamb of
[41:29] God and it's not just in Egypt this is DCA in India same character same character DOA said you Daka was told you will populate the world Dasha goes no problem he goes out and has I think it's
[41:44] 20,000 kids and he gets mad at them because they won't reproduce they're just out playing he's like you guys are supposed to be having sex why don't you have sex he got so mad that he gave 20,000 more kids he spit them
[41:59] out and he tried it again you guys have to have to make whoe why did you need to jump start why would you need to jump start fertility B of
[42:16] jedit carrying three things the was symbol of power thean is symbol of fertility some of you will say life but I want you to understand that I think life is actually more about fertility it's okay for us to call it life but
[42:30] there was a time when life and fertility were were weren't necessarily clear that fertility was an invention that you did not know about until you did and that the truth in that room is here today and
[42:44] this is what's saying that that baffet is giving the power of fertility and memory the Jed pillar is memory to the king
[42:57] this is this is like my favorite thing so I think it was that uh giant circus guy forget his name right now who discovered stuff but uh you follow the
[43:08] hieroglyphs this way and so we're saying ban of jedit beget the Scarab which is fertility goat make
[43:20] fertility goat make fertility cane DOA fertility Bringers fertility
[43:34] Bringers the Waters of fertility why would a goat be associated with fertility do you understand we had emis guys Artemis nothing but boobs and we took that goddess and said no no no I
[43:52] don't want to do do you have anything in Goat do you have anything in Goat because that makes me think more about fertility than Artemis just like she couldn't even hold her arms down you know she was just like hello good to see
[44:07] you now it's Pan's the god of fertility right and something very special happened to Pam something very special that you may not have actually put this together yet Pan the son of Hermes and a wood
[44:22] nymph hermafrodit the son of from Aphrodite the name literally means all or to pasture and what what you don't know
[44:34] about pan or that you may not know was that he was the only Greek god who actually dies and why does he die because he invented
[44:48] fertility that if you can't die you can't have fertility so if you want to invent fertility someone got to Die the Oracle of Mythology is all
[45:00] around you that you learned of the concept of death and before you had that concept it wasn't there you had no clue we see in the Patriarchs over time
[45:17] a massive drop in age longevity that massive drop in longevity is the introduction of f this is the meosis this is the mitosis the truth is always in the
[45:38] room our very first successful genetic transplant from an adult embryo I believe that's the right way to say it is is Dolly and it turns out that
[45:52] sheep have this special sort of thing where they're just great for genetics that there's just something about that that bank that does so well to uh to store information some of you may not be aware
[46:08] of a concept called chimerism every one of you is a chimera no one's just had the heart to tell you that you you were a twin inside of a twin in fact only recently have we
[46:22] looked at genetic code and we understand that 50 places down in the middle of one message is a whole new person and the messages of that person is entwined in them and that you are the activation of
[46:33] the Chimera a twin of a twin living inside one body a twin of a twin how many is that four four I know you gnostics you know why I said four
[46:47] because it's giving you this clue even more we've understood our nature to have this builtin chimerism only now do we get that and that there is still a creature this guy's just
[47:02] having a total life the rivalus who can self himself right it's called selfing where he takes himself out to dinner and has a baby this is the four corners of your genes and that you will always be
[47:22] four and that you were simply a living Avatar of your entire genetic line and you're an ancestor built on top of a unit of ancestors you're the person you were yesterday is your ancestor and
[47:36] underneath that there's a shadow and some of you have gotten to know it that 50 places down in your genetic code is another person that has feelings wisdom thoughts it's all there
[47:48] you're carrying that person with you you could need him later we look at where we've come now with Zeno transplantation multiplet chimerism modeling humans all these
[48:02] things reminds me that the archons have bodies that are both female and male faces that are the faces of beasts thus they're not truly male nor female nor human nor animal the Ancients found this kind of boundary Crossing to be deeply
[48:15] threatening truth is in the room right Matthew Mark Luke John Aquarius Leo Taurus Scorpio the chimera will always be in the room and it doesn't matter how uptight you try and make your
[48:30] church it's still going to come through it can't stop it this is vetruvian adom before Adam and Eve there was a
[48:41] Edom AE D- M I call it the protoplast of the first formed he's the Primal hermaphrodite and the sacred andr androgine this is a complete man including the parts that aren't visible
[48:56] when you the perfect man in Da Vinci's drawing is seven heads high but he read this from Vitruvius and Vitruvius said eight he said eight heads high this is a
[49:10] chimera there is a one Chimera is living in a circle right here and the other Chimera is living in a square right here that these are the
[49:23] true essence of what man is and da Vinci knew this not because of genetics and that you and I resonate to this drawing we've resonated the whole time but it took James True to tell you
[49:37] why right that that this chimerism fits the bill and the truth has to be in the room so all of us will resonate to this the same way all of us will resonate to Egypt the same way all of us will resonate to the same things because it
[49:52] rings true this is unfortunate there's a layout problem here but you're missing the eighth sorry I need you to picture that it says
[50:07] testes down here and I want you to do some math so if you're a male you are seven heads High hypothalamus pituitary thyroid right all of these and then you stop it at testing and if you're a female you would change testes for
[50:21] ovaries so the perfect male what was the true is saying the perfect man is the hermaphrodite the perfect man has both right it's like the only room I can say that and people aren't like oh where's
[50:38] my pearls I must clutch them thank you for that a Edom is the Sun and the Moon United apocalypse Adam we'll I'm going to skip over that because I'm going to make sure I get to this other
[50:54] stuff we seen this Andrew dine uh whoops we've seen this um in in a lot of older statues we we might call this Janice I'm not trying to argue with you but I think that that's I think we choose Janice
[51:09] because it's like yeah that statue you got outside with a girl that's holding her skirt up and she's got a preus showing and they're like oh it's just Janice it's Janice it just means the end of the year that's all and I hope you
[51:22] can see that the politeness right that we employ that we have to slowly shame preus until it goes away and please keep in mind shame is good shame is important Psalm 1395 you have formed me
[51:36] before and behind it's it's a face inside of face it's not it's a face inside of face is what the Hebrew means and if you picture the Chimera it's not a face on the back
[51:51] it's two faces facing front and it could be divided down the line the Taylor person I showed you I show her all of you are Chimera she's not it's not special she's just uh what's that word demonstrating it that's not
[52:05] the right word but she's showing it and so half of her body is redder than the other you have that too some of you will see cats dogs that have this too it's two dogs living in
[52:16] one the side of Adam that it's actually not rib it's side and we're we're absolutely correct to call it rib it's fine but if you if you start to look at the side you start to get a little bit closer to what I'm
[52:31] trying to explain to you that he took one of his sides not ribs Adam is not used as a proper name until Genesis 4:1 it's actually referred to as a thing not a
[52:47] person and I think the reason why is because he hadn't been divided yet the truth is always always in the room Eve is referred to as a
[53:03] he either the he is an error or it should be she says one of the famous commentators in here it's not the only example of that Eve is a he here extra
[53:20] rib we have a cervical rib and in people that have larger physiologies this extra rib uh is present we call it a genetic defect but I think it's just a shadow it's just a shadow of an older version of who we
[53:35] used to be and this older version would be eight heads high and every single reptile that has this kind of cervical rib has it for one reason they have a lot more weight to carry above their
[53:49] shoulders and so the Giants lost the cervical rib and we see REM minutes of that today let me skip that for now sorry let see
[54:02] here here Rebecca is a young boy Noah her tent oh my gosh you guys are gonna freaking oh Genesis 9:21 is such a freaking gold mind it is such a gold M I don't even think I can do a
[54:18] Justice right now but I want you to picture that the entire story of Noah and going into the tent and seeing him naked could have been a
[54:29] hermaphrodite and that the reason why ham was trying to uh fertilize was because he felt that he was cursed and the reason why he was cursed is because
[54:41] he did not live as long as his father Noah and so he went to Noah when Noah was drunk and he knew him and you could only know Noah if Noah was a hermaphrodite I'd like for you to
[54:56] picture for the rest of this talk Noah as a baffet hermaphrodite I know it's weird but I want you to remember the mythology is is the truth not the actual pictured words it's the mythology that's
[55:10] showing you these things here's more examples uh of this gender mix uh Mark Samuels writes a book called The Secret name of God just an excellent resource I
[55:25] encourage you all to check that out if you want to know more about this Elijah Eliah my God Eli he is
[55:37] she atum Adam the complete one describes a a primordial self-created hermaphrodite what if God had boobs and balls sorry I just had to get that
[55:51] in right we see this in Aphrodite in fact uh the horn Venus is a picture of a woman that has a horn and it's interesting that we chose
[56:04] the symbol of a woman with a horn not the female male symbol combined we purposely said no no no it's a female with a horn and if you think about where that horn would be doesn't say
[56:17] horns but you can start to see this is the preus the shaming the covering up but we still need to keep the truth because the truth is always in the room highly recommend this read I think a lot
[56:29] of James Valentine stuff has probably been disproved by Academia I have to say disproved in quotes because I really think so much of what's happening is is that we're just trying to normalize our history and we just can't help it over
[56:43] time we just we find ourselves kind of being put into this groove and I think that's probably happened now but he has some fascinating looks at the rise of preus also and this idea of this uh this
[56:56] name of God elohim's pronouns are they and we yahweh's pronouns are that and I right I am that which I am but when you
[57:10] look at Elohim it's always we or or they and it's showing you this this concept of Consciousness itself uh this gentleman suffered a rough rough time because he decided to say what I just
[57:27] said and I just want to take a moment to say it's really great that you guys aren't killing me right now thanks a lot uh same for uh Lancy uh both these guys uh this guy was saying Christ was androgynous Pope was
[57:42] not happy about that this is the gentleman Valentine I recommend you check this out it's a really really fascinating uh look um about God being double sexed
[57:59] when souls in the Zohar when Souls issue from Heaven they issue male and female uh another one from the Zohar just as she is called by the name of the male so he is called by her
[58:12] name uh We rise in the presence of the sup superal King and male unites with female and my favorite Yahweh he
[58:23] she when you open the name Yahweh it's inside out that on the outside Yahweh says Yahweh but when you unfold the doors of the of the Torah you're looking at the Reversed image of
[58:37] Yahweh which is the fanatic of HEI the secret name of God I don't have to tell you as gnostics or fans of gnosticism how crucial it was to hide truth in plain sight and that I would
[58:53] argue to you that the most mystical things that we know are still hidden from us because quite frankly you would be killed if you dared to speak it here Adobe is subverting the dominant
[59:07] androgine what I mean by that is is that they've taken hoppy a traditional hermaphrodite and removed her breasts made them less made them more male and they're trying to standardize this idea but this is a

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
59:21] hermaphrodite and of course the ceremonial beard of Egypt keep in mind you would shave your face and then put on a ceremonial beard it was a necessary part to
[59:34] reinvigorate this concept their Chief is blind because of his power and his ignorance and his arrogance he said I am God there is no other before
[59:50] me this is the spine the Demi urge is a blind God he has every single uh archon Eon every single urge everything is happening inside of
[01:00:06] him when he said this he sinned against all the speech rose up to incorruptibility then there was a voice that came forth from incorruptibility saying you are wrong that is God of the
[01:00:20] Blind and when I say wrong you're looking at the rising of sentience my friends Consciousness itself rises in the spine and speaks and before it speaks we call that
[01:00:34] the Demi urge homunculus Earth is a cosmology that I've named because I want you to picture what it's like to live in the head of a
[01:00:50] dime that when you're here you start to build your entire world and you map it and you create Egypt you create uh Asia you create the rivers you build the
[01:01:03] mountains inside your world and you build all of the cities that you would go that you build homonculus Earth from the experiences you've had since you were a tho from your very very first
[01:01:19] moment know thyself right Temple of Deli the optic nerve aren't the Sun and the Moon simply positive and negative aren't we just having an electrical circuitry experience in this environment haven't
[01:01:37] we simply just painted the reality inside our eyeballs and that this reality allows us to work that it's a utilitarian idea of Truth meaning this is what works you are
[01:01:52] gastal incarnate it's literally who you are there's not one piece of who you are that can be pointed to in a Petri dish that every concept that you have of who you are is
[01:02:04] a meta circuit that's built on top of another meta circuit and that all of that is the neurons that run underneath what if you are
[01:02:19] Osiris what if this is the underworld right here in the story of Osiris he was chopped up into little pieces there's a huge argument over how many pieces Osiris was chopped up in some some
[01:02:33] insist 14 some insist it's 28 some say nine some say 13 I say it's 37.2 trillion that's how many cells are in your body and that's how many cells are conscious they have a sentience because
[01:02:46] they have to and that sentience conglomerates into a Yahweh there can be only one because your body can only only have one person in charge and that charge is literal in
[01:03:03] charge zygote becoming Elohim I want to point out that Adam and Eve and Osiris were both deceived and I'm arguing that it wasn't deceived they were
[01:03:20] uned uned that there was a remov or separation away from or out of being conscious of something and that the reason why we say that Adam and Eve were deceived is because they were removed of
[01:03:35] their seant right the seant that they had before they came was erased this is this entire rising of Consciousness the chief is
[01:03:48] blind homunculus Earth zetetic this is who you are synthetically this is what your body looks like this isn't a I'm not I'm not that perverted this is a scientific
[01:04:03] drawing showing you what your senses are really like how much of the world you actually perceive this should tell you alone that that our model for the for the world is built on something quite different this
[01:04:18] is towett and I want you to picture how this got here because there was a time when you were a chicken embryo and you had fish gills or close to it and that when you had fish gills you built a
[01:04:31] cosmology that put you as a fish and so you had a gpan you had all the concepts waiting for you there and that as you grew the transitory aspects of higher animals that you started to morph into
[01:04:43] different creatures different Chimera and that's what we know today in Egypt every single animal is expressed over the life of Osirus this is why we think tette is the
[01:05:00] creation deity because he was he was there was a time when this concept fit this is a lizard this is a
[01:05:13] human lizard human right I think it's an alligator forgive me maybe a crocodile so we've gone through all these animals
[01:05:27] we understand all these things we change our cosmology as we grow that all these are just different cosmologies that we've had to invent as we grow old this is the
[01:05:42] umbilical people call this Maya you enter in the Great Snake I'm sorry you enter into the Great Snake you are ingested by the giant snake of May
[01:05:55] and you live and if you're lucky enough to live long enough you reverberate what we call death the first thing that happens barbello the [ __ ] of
[01:06:09] Babylon Isis introduces you to memory fertility and Adam and Eve are born this is not Adam and Eve this is the actual family in the Tomb but they're the
[01:06:24] living embodiment of that the god of Judas explains that God is an essentially a luminous cloud of light who exists in an imperishable realm freaking Amazon web
[01:06:38] server that's God the Demi urge is your sense of agency we take for granted how we come to who we are that there's a battle that's
[01:06:52] happening every day between your archons to decide who's you and that that personality can switch at any time some of you are lucky enough to understand and believe and see that you have multiple personalities most of you don't most of
[01:07:08] you think no I'm just one guy I totally got this all under control there's four of you inside your genetic code they got something to say too
[01:07:18] right know move on here to make sure I get all this in this is the ego the ID the ego all these things are building up they're creating this concept of self and who you
[01:07:32] are that the Demi urge what is the Demi urge but the working of people the working of people why are the archons seem so evil because they got all these horns look at
[01:07:50] all these horns got a lateral horn we've got a dorsal horn we got ventral horn the horns of the demiurge Prince of
[01:08:05] Darkness five lower vertebrae 12 thoracic vertebrae right holy spirit father of greatness Prince of Darkness uniting in one remember Tower ated Earth demon dragon eagle fish lion that your
[01:08:19] cellular body went through all of these modes to be born I have scientism at the top this is not a an insult I I firmly believe that our Academia is just just another form of belief and that's not an insult it's
[01:08:33] just simply how our world works that everything we do is church seven archons would rule seven heavens and five in the abyss you have seven true ribs and five false
[01:08:50] ones the truth is always in the the room step away from the others and I shall tell you the mysteries of the Kingdom this really is at the
[01:09:04] heart of gnosticism that only by stepping away can you release yourself from the electrical charge of Shame and listen to the
[01:09:16] truth that you are here to unwrap your shame and find ways to perceive what's actually happening outside the confines of being burned at the stake or being
[01:09:29] chased down or being fired or losing subscribers right that what gnosticism is is the constant struggle to stare into the [ __ ] sun and not
[01:09:43] move that's why there's so little of us that's why we spent so much time unearthing literature that was just nothing but ridicule because we know that the truth is always in the room
[01:09:56] like to thank you guys for coming thank you for your time I appreciate it thank you for that can you guys hear me we'll take a few questions and uh go to the next one uh
[01:10:18] Mitch please uh state which one of the four of you is asking the question thank you that was really beautiful uh question on priapus I wondered if you could say a word about how the figure of
[01:10:31] priapus has been uh digested into um contemporary scholarship because chiefly uh preus is identified as a a sort of Backwater minor rural God and why do we
[01:10:45] not see more statuary and so on yeah I think it would be impossible to that the people who would see pipus wouldn't be allowed to have children because Society is constantly uh creating new modes that we can uh uh uh
[01:11:00] mate and that the ability to to court I should say to court and that Court courting requires a subtlety if you'll notice as animals learn to court they're actually showing off how much energy they have and that the one that usually
[01:11:13] wins is not the dude that's like full on he's the guy that is reserved and he's showing you the subtlety of the energy he has and I think that that just naturally turns us into this shame thing
[01:11:26] which makes it harder makes it more erect because the fetish itself is the power so you're looking at a capacitor that's compressing all that energy into a single place and we're either dealing

[ARTICLE SHOULD BE ABOUT]:
- The speaker discusses the significance of bones found in the Cave of Patriarchs, including those of Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Rebecca, and Leah, suggesting they hold valuable information about mythology and truth.

- They propose reinventing the concept of the soul based on modern understanding, emphasizing the body as a filament and consciousness as the beholding of awareness.

- Memory is highlighted as crucial for consciousness, with the assertion that it takes two moments to recognize consciousness, indicating the importance of persistent memory.
