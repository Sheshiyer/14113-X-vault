[04:33] Cage's son bro how How how Wild was that dude no I missed that one when did that come out an episode ago so episode 198 I had Weston cage on bro how did I miss
[04:47] that bro because I saw I think I saw that's probably the one I seen because I said I want to make sure he gets me on for 201 because I want to be the one that that brings some light and I don't that this will be 201 bro this will be
[05:00] event 20 that's that's what I wanted but I did not know that that was the interview because I heard you mention in space Man the video you covered that you probably he followed you or something like that or did did he follow your one
[05:14] of your social media platforms so I think I've talked about it on maybe behind the the wall and it'll be on episode 200 but it was weird because what
[05:28] happened was and the reason it sign ific is because he followed me the night I started which it's not out yet it'll maybe it might be out by the time this is out but I started a a show on
[05:41] reviewing Nick Cage movies called The Church of cage okay and that night mind you I haven't told anybody except me and my friend like we were doing this as like a fun little project like pop culture movies stuff like that we break down Nick Cage movies talk about the
[05:55] esoteric and oul themes in it if there is any and just have fun and that same night I went to sleep I woke up and homeboy was following me bro and i' I've been following this guy for like 2 and a half years so what are the what are the chances of that happening you know what
[06:09] I'm saying like what are the chances of that lining up the way it did that's crazy bro because let me tell you something Nicholas Cage movie colors out of space did you guys
[06:22] talk about that yo that was one of the most ult esoteric movies of all time bro if
[06:35] nobody has seen that movie well you I mean the movie may disturb you in some spots because y'all remember y'all covered The Spider and the the mother and the son became a spider yeah bro yeah I know it was trippy and it's funny you're bringing this up because it's got
[06:51] to do with what we're going to talk about today because that was an HP Lovecraft movie and it was it was a Lovecraft movie yeah it was Necronomicon yeah yeah exactly so I think bro that Nick Cage reveals a lot of things in his
[07:05] movies and again Weston was talking about how they own original copies of elus Levi Crowley all these books so again I'm
[07:16] just saying they know about it and I I believe Nick Cage Mr Nick Cage is into the Paranormal spirituality and and the Occult I mean there's a reason why they they he grew up and and they owned a lot of haunted
[07:30] locations bro wow he own one of the most haunted mansions in in Louisiana dude really yeah really yeah well it
[07:42] doesn't surprise me because he has so many movies with esoteric messages and for you to have that connection bro you know kudos to you your platform that [ __ ] get a lot of um get a lot of views
[07:57] bro I I got to check it out right after this man I'm excited to check out bro it was a synch it was a weird synchronicity and like I said I couldn't ignore it and I waited a few days and I hit him up and I was like hey bro would you come on immediately he wrote back it
[08:12] was the weirdest thing like immediately he hit me back up I'm like I don't know man so manifestation bro that it's time yeah no I'll tell you some stuff after the show that I can't reveal on there yet but tell you some stuff Annie where
[08:26] can people find you bro you got a podcast you got a YouTube channel where go yes come on come on over to YouTube at anaru you can follow me from the
[08:36] spiritual shade room on Instagram I also have a a great grow a great big growing with patreon right now patreon's growing uh patreon.com
[08:50] Thorp spiritual shade room is called the true Ault newspaper and we're we're growing as a community and understanding this science and I'm very proud with uh the information that people in the group
[09:04] are unveiling and the more we dig deeper to what's occurring in 2024 the Year of the Dragon awesome make sure to go follow Anie over there and dude I'm excited for
[09:18] this one when we had originally connected we pushed back the date because you wanted to talk about some stuff then you hit me up I think it was yesterday or something and you're like I got this this and this and I named until
[09:31] right now the show the Cletus The Cletus The cus the cus ritual Soul Elementals and interdimensional space travel now the reason that cedus is important is
[09:45] because it lines up with Florida bro Florida really is the transmutational FIS of the United States okay its birthday was also 33
[09:59] so it was the Last Frontier we have it's the Sunshine State Disney World the most magical place on
[10:10] Earth Coral Castle you have NASA space x x marks the spot so many so many many things Onie and when you said cus I was
[10:23] like and that ties into the lovecraftian aspect because according to lenda the marsh and the swamps and Florida is the best place to manifest the great old
[10:37] ones the Deep ones okay and this is this is directly from Peter leenda's work okay you had the KW cell workking rituals which I know that you're
[10:49] familiar with here in Miami Florida in 19 80 something I believe it was where the dude induced an abduction right he induced an alien abduction to
[11:02] extract some information from another realm okay so when you said cus I was like monster sea creature cthulu esque in a
[11:15] sort of way it's also on Old Florida maps as well I'll post them up here where there's a little cus on the on the corner of it and the constellation there's star Maps Old star
[11:28] maps that line up with and it would make sense because and I could be getting this wrong this is Narco Longo territory but I think that is Florida Pisces did I get that right let's see
[11:43] here let me let me double check was either the Pisces which is the portal I think it is so that would make sense because if it is yeah Pisces born on March 3rd
[11:54] symbolized by the fish so that would make sense that is a fish it looks like a fish I've heard I've heard people put it that it's the best place for manifestation cuz there's water on all sides and underneath us bro and you know
[12:09] that water retains memory so take it away Anie and I got some other stuff that once we get into the space travel and all that cuz space travel has to do with Florida as well we got NASA we got
[12:22] SpaceX we have Elon Musk here and I've got some connections on something I was digging in for a friend regarding one of my favorite topics which is Don D and
[12:33] Kelly when they were given the formula I guess to the athers and these athers are other dimensions okay that they never got to explore themselves but some things were revealed to them that happened before that that was
[12:49] interesting so take it away Anie like the the in noan Keys the talking about the E 328 okay yeah yeah there's a lot of uh interdimensional stuff speaking of Necronomicon astr Grim
[13:03] Wars uh is based upon these astr Grim Wars that lovecraft's father was collecting a lot of people don't know that he learned most of the names of the Great old ones from his father it's come
[13:16] from a Department of Defense documentation from a Liberian that that a military war like Liberian who was collecting these things and this the guy happened to work up under um Michael
[13:30] Aquino who's passed away now yeah first the guy who was in Church of Satan went the Church of set Don web and those guys came out of him now Don web yeah yeah
[13:44] the the P one eyebrows and everything so and his wife Lilith Lilith of queeno and Don web now owns the Lovecraft
[13:56] Library wait what hold on hold on yeah let me pull up this specimen of a man this guy here bro look at this dude's eyebrows son eyebrow game on point look
[14:09] at this the evilest eyebrows of all time so or repeat that again one one more time you said that yeah I can go real in real in depth about it
[14:25] how his father he was a traveling man M lovecraft's father and he contract he contracted tertiary syphilis syphilis and when he was going through
[14:39] that he would yell out these names Kulu y because he had these collection of of grim Wars from these Arabian dark magic
[14:53] priests and it was called the hayat Alim one of the original astr Rim Wars of the Stars how to connect with Cosmic intelligences and everything so he had that in his life he had a massive ult
[15:06] Library so when he died they lost all of their Fortune now but the library went the Lovecraft so he grew up reading these books but he would hear his father recite these names so basically make a long story short when Lovecraft got hit
[15:21] with his I don't know brain aneurism or whatever I think I think he was taking out personally but um l aino and Don web they now own the
[15:34] Lovecraft Library confirmed by a DOD Liberian won't put all of their information out there but uh yeah that's who owns the Lovecraft library but going back to what you were talking about the
[15:47] great old ones there's a lot of information on the on the great old ones and future alien Colts that Lovecraft warned about people becoming cultists
[15:59] not a cultist but cultist to alien god which which is what we're we're dealing with especially with the cedus is a whale but it's called the dragon
[16:35] fish and it's the Chinese year of the dragon you know so I I I couldn't help myself because I've been covering all these Dragon rituals you know they they just took out in
[16:47] gatria airat Toyama Dragon Ball Z creator dies a couple of weeks ago in the year of the dragon like come on man bro
[17:01] yeah look at this the Bayer flamy what is this even it's got 88 of those Stars the gates right there man I broke down this Bayer guy in my video The Reptilian
[17:15] myth oh my God you gotta you gotta look at look into that everyone I started watching that one I I I didn't finish it but I did start I know which one you're talking about I have to go back and revisit it gotta finish it gotta finish it because you know I usually get in the
[17:29] scholarship way deep in my videos people say I need to stop doing that but um okay so the seed is called the dragon fish right in Mesopotamia is called
[17:40] thite mes and that's the dragon goddess this is the original Dragon goddess of Sumeria that whole area is this constellation now why is this constellation important the eclipse this year the path
[17:56] of totality is the name of the eclipse it passes directly over a town in Texas called Jonah so this is the biblo mancy I I I speak about I don't know how these
[18:10] people do it because even the path of the eclipse from 2017 20 there was another one in like 2021 there was another one in earlier in 20 I mean late in 2023 now we have one
[18:24] coming it makes the Paleo hebraic um uh what you call it symbols of the word twab and Al in Hebrew it it literally
[18:40] makes the symbols I have you know photos and everything but the top of the eclipse is going to start in a town called Jonas and you know about the story of Jonas being
[18:53] trapped in the well then it's going to pass through seven and eight towns called Neva there's these towns relev to ninev in the Bible where in the Bible the town
[19:08] or the place of Nineveh I don't know if it's a town or I don't know what it was a country but it was given 40 days to repent and Jonah was the messenger so we have this whale constellation you know I speak
[19:22] about the supervoid um the super void information in the opening of the Cults spot out there and you you you highlighted it in that video you guys did on Space
[19:34] Spaceman the Adam Sandler movie that they had this open void out there of these what they call it Spectre right and it had particles from the beginning and the end of time did you watch that
[19:48] movie wow yeah I broke it down too yeah I want to get into some spider stuff is I got some stuff from Kenneth Grant that I used to look into that really sparked my mind when I saw you guys video I
[20:00] appreciate you guys for doing that but so this constellation cus the dragon fish in the year of the dragon there's also something called the devil Comet I don't know if you've been hearing about this but there's a devil Comet coming
[20:15] around the time of the eclipse and Revelations 12:9 talks about a star falling to the Earth while the sun is black speaking about the eclipse you got
[20:28] the Comet coming and there's these petroglyphs showing these entities with the seven headed creature that the Bible spoke about in Revelation is talking
[20:40] about the dragons the the whole Dragon thing which I know is esoteric but we can get into it so cedus is originally associated with the Mesopotamian Tiamat uh it's called cedus the sea
[20:54] monster it was slain in mythology by Perseus which which Perseus is a form of all of the other hero mythologies that came before like hu and all of that and
[21:07] he he save he saves this princess called Andromeda which is another constellation from Pan's wrath now the cedus constellation is a is in a
[21:20] pisan a pising area on the star Maps this area includes idonis Pisces Pisces ostrin and Aquarius it's called The Sea of the sky that's what
[21:36] it's called It's called The Sea of the sky and they're talking about Perseus helping Andromeda Escape Poseidon's wrath well when you think about Poseidon Poseidon is nothing but a form
[21:50] of inl you know the TR the Trident God remember we did the I don't know if you were on that video we did it yeah we did it with the Trident all the Trident rituals and how Biden name the a tupong trident is called a
[22:04] bident and then you have Ukraine symbol is a trident you know UK and the Kazarian Crest is a trident and Ukraine used to be a Kazarian region a lot of people
[22:17] don't know that and then you have the blue associated with the Israel flag and I did a video about how the blue on the Israel Flag represents the Waters above the firmament and
[22:31] Below when I get into The Shield information so it's comparative to all of this water symbology which is esoteric as well because there's a Astro
[22:46] etherical uh um interdimensional uh region of Consciousness that these are coaches enter into the sky or into out interdimensionally that we're going to speak about today interdimensional space
[23:00] travel how to project your conscious Fields out there in the Astro etherical spheres which is what all of these people are trying to do apparently so the C is recognized by all of these mythologist
[23:13] cedus has be has been depicted throughout history by many um whatever the name of the people who name the constellations and he's been he's been
[23:26] given several animal bodies was mainly a pisan body with animal different animal heads attached to his form so this led me to do some research
[23:39] so I'm typing stuff now and I come across this movie called Jona and I'm trying to figure out okay there's a movie coming out called Jonah it's a alien movie there's an alien
[23:51] movie it comes up and I said oh wow this is interesting this is cool so I click and I figure out the mov movie came out the day before you know I'm looking at it it's already out I know so I went and
[24:05] watched it I watched it a couple days ago I thought it I thought it was coming out oh okay okay yeah it came out like like when I saw it it was I say it's already out came out a couple days ago got a pyramid and everything up here J and what day did it release at what day
[24:19] was it that it released uh what was it was released on March 12 March 12 released on March 12 so 412 which 48 is the eclipse
[24:32] 48 is also the first day Crowley made contact and 410 was the F the first Contact that John deed had with nage which is the the
[24:45] tablet of Na the round tablet of navage that was the the precursor to the LI the Libra the Libra logga the speech of God that would bring forth the apocalypse and Ragnarok so all these dates are
[24:59] lining up around the same the same time that's interesting well it's more interesting that the eclipse is gonna in out of Crowley Texas it's going to empty out a Crowley
[25:15] Tech like come on man and you got all this Texas symbolism why do all these people have cowboy hats you got Beyonce and all these people put on cowboy hats I gotta break that the star bro the Lone Star it's the pentagram I mean it's the
[25:27] the had the five-pointed star isn't it a five-pointed star yeah it is it is the Lone Star State but um interesting you had the one of the actors up there his name
[25:39] is uh Ori Chow is one of the main actors in Jonah and there's another woman what was the woman's name in the
[25:52] movie whoever the woman is in the movie that the the actress yeah uh I think that's her right there that's her real son in the movie so I'm trying to find
[26:05] this kid the kid who plays Jonah CL no it's not her it's not her that's not it um their last name is um what is his last name I just had it up here we
[26:20] go CH Chow that's yeah that's the there there she go Elena Huffman Elena Huffman her son you see how the the Jonah is played by Lincoln Huffman down there okay see
[26:32] that's her that's her biological son so I couldn't find nothing on him and then I go on her page so she's the real mother in she's the mother to this boy who is abducted by aliens but in
[26:46] real life that's her real child so I'm I'm looking into this information and this guy okay so you might recognize her from Elena Huffman yeah she was in Super natural the Supernatural series you ever saw
[27:01] Supernatural with s Sam and Dean you know going Supernatural this one right here yeah right there this is a big show right
[27:14] here I've never seen it bro oh my God bro oh oh God you gotta go watch they hunt monsters right right but they they they they they interact with the angels and demons that

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
28:28] on April 8th so I'm like how are there how are they aligning these things so directly it almost made me question whether there is some blue beam going on
[28:40] is the eclipse real I'm starting to question stuff now but I'mma just assume that it is real and they've been calculating this way ahead of time and now they're rolling out the movies in
[28:53] the in the numerology to confirm their you know their uh future predictions of how this stuff goes but in the movie it's it's crazy bro I don't want to spoil it for everyone trying to find a
[29:07] picture of her son here I got the movie pulled up and I'm clicking through it just pull up just type in Jonah alien movie he should be I see him here so this is homeboy right here but he's he's
[29:20] in a wheelchair in the movie at first he's cool but then a a alien possess his body wow he's in a wheelchair and he's he's talking about
[29:34] the end of the world he's talking about what's bro he says in 2025 he names everything that's gonna happen to the world he said like yeah 2025 this this this is gonna happen this war is gonna
[29:46] pop off it's crazy bro it's crazy when you watch it and he really doesn't need the wheelchair they show that later in he gets up and walks and he really doesn't even need the wheelchair but
[29:59] this this guy in the movie orsi his character he was abducted when he was a boy when he was a little boy yeah the child guy he was adopted and what he
[30:11] he's a he's a film he's a film produc he has his film own film company and he travels around the world and gets these stories these strains of cult stories and someone wants him to do a alien one
[30:25] alien abduction story and he was like a that nobody's going to listen to that but then he has a dream and remembers that when he was young he told people that he was abducted too I don't mean I don't want to be mean
[30:40] but I don't want to be mean but this kid kind of looks like cedus he kind of looks like a sea monster right when you I'm just saying all right come on
[30:53] bro he looks a little he just here I'm gonna pull up cedus and I want you to see the constellation uhhuh and he looks like bro can't tell me doesn't look like
[31:06] that a little bit yeah I'm not hey I I get it bro hey it be it be Stranger than what you know though listen bro because listen listen Annie
[31:20] isn't there the story where who is the who's the character in mythology that is impreg the mother is impregnated by a sea monster what what mythology is that you know which I'm talking
[31:33] about she was impregnated by a sea monster yeah that it's not Greek mythology is it here let me look it up so mythology mother and
[31:44] pregnated by seated by sea monster so it is Greek mythology d d let's see here the only child
[32:02] so that's interesting here here here so all right here we go here we go hold on keto sometimes spell cedo is the goddess of sea monsters and other marine life according to Greek mythology she bore
[32:15] several monstrous children including forcity for fored for cities with her love her lover who the hell is this gu this guy SE moner yeah oh there you go he's he's like a
[32:30] freaking part primordial look at cthulu bro come on dog oh yeah you know you know he's going to pop up let's go look at this dude with his tentacle penis probably he's slanging that that cthulu dick
[32:44] [Music] bro you I got that cthulu [ __ ] on him bro ready dude just slinging that thing come on dude wow the other picture is wow too
[32:58] I wouldn't I wouldn't doubt it bro I wouldn't doubt it I'm I'm just right because we're talking about Bloodlines and like how these people kind of some people right again I'm just Nephilim all
[33:10] these weird Legends of these ultraterrestrials mating with humans and making this Offspring so what's to say that all right let's say that you talked about the sea in the sky and perhaps
[33:24] these extraterrestrials are from not out other planets but from the oceans I mean that's the whole theme of Lovecraft right and a lot of the the shadow over nsmith the freaking people that come out
[33:38] of the water the the what do they call them damn anyways you know which one I'm talking about where they crawl all the water and one of the things was they would offer up offerings to these things right the so again I'm just thinking
[33:52] outside the I'm not I'm not trying to be mean all right I know people are probably to cook me in the comments but I look you and I we look at symbolism and we see things right we see things a little bit differently cuz we're constantly looking at symbolism
[34:06] and that's what just popped out because what are the chances that the guy you said that the that the main guy in the in the movie really got abducted right
[34:16] and then that it's her biological son like what what's the again I mean I could say the same thing about Nick Cage and Weston like they both they're both actors but is there something more to it bro you know what I'm saying I'm not
[34:30] insinuating anything against anyone but I'm just saying like to keep it within the family lines in some sort of way but this topic that we're talking about now it's interesting I don't just trying to
[34:42] draw his name is is it is it Ori or or or but it was like a woman that the the Nazis had Maria Ori or something like that that do these Channel channelings but the the point I was making is
[34:57] strange Stranger than what you think because everything is waveforms and when we're talking metaphysics we're talking about the interactions of waveforms on subatomic level to third dimensional fourth dimensional up levels and when you said
[35:11] that the the people came out of the sea or these monsters came out of found it bro I found it here you go even even better bro we're talking about Bloodlines and all that stuff right ready sorry to cut you off Anie but here we go here we go were the marenian
[35:25] descendants from a monster meet the quinar so half man half B never mind quinar anyways but but in this line of thought in early Frankish history there
[35:37] was a beast of Neptune which was said to look like a creature called a quinar the mysterious mythical being only appeared in one text but he was said to have fed a line of Kings whose descendants still survive today and they even made an
[35:52] appearance in The Da Vinci Code so that the the same L of thinking of what we're talk what we were just talking about these Bloodlines not from from look at that I mean it's it's like a freaking who's
[36:06] this guy but affir mention the mysterious monster Beast of Neptune is a quinar half yeah quinar C monster yeah bro dog and this would make sense why all these Elites why they all have
[36:21] submarine licenses right yeah right here here we go look br I did a whole video on how gizen Maxwell she owns a company called
[36:34] teramac that's all about the submarine she owns submarine teramar my bad it's like submarine she had these submarine uh connections through her father who worked for the Messi the CIA intelligence of Israel and J uh Joe
[36:49] Biden's brother James Biden he owns water Island right next to Epstein Island and it used to be a submarine Bas yeah it was in the trust it's called water Island we're speaking about water and the name of the island is called
[37:03] water Island so um so but you're right you're right yeah I I didn't mean to cut you off but I knew this is what I was thinking about the marenian line because I was reading the we we know about TT and I was reading some of her work and
[37:18] she talks about the marians and we're talking about hidden hyperspace places right in other Realms other realities and how they're either trying to physically go there and manifest themselves there or they're trying to
[37:32] project their Consciousness there and what if Anie what if this is the missing link where you quite literally can't go there unless you're in some way different quite literally genetically
[37:46] like you have something and if you look at a lot of the and I've seen this on Twitter and and social media I'm not trying to be mean but people have been not complain in but pointing out these similarities in all these women in
[38:01] Hollywood coming out with like the really spaced out eyes right where they all kind of look similar in a weird sort of way we know that these family Bloodlines look at the hapsburgs right
[38:14] to to bring in John D and and Prague and all these guys that were talking to the ofen and right these how you're talking about these Celestial Galactic beings that man I'm bro I'm just like like
[38:31] everything no no because there's a genetic you talking about genetic access code there's a woman on Instagram I want you guys to follow I think her name is like Claire nchra it's like NRA vadic astrology and she does videos on those women with the eyes or or specific
[38:46] cheekbones she goes through all the Hollywood women and she shows like a deity compared to very astrology to the constellations of where why do they have this type of face like how do we get our
[38:57] genetic imprints is all related to the starfields of the the way that we look I'm talking about how your face your cheekbones your lips all of this is all astrological you know and and yeah
[39:10] there's a genetic access code I speak about the first Zar coats or the first men that ate meat the Zar coats there's a book on them called Zar coats the alien wounds because their women they said their women used to get pregnant
[39:25] with aliens and stuff you can look up the book um donut found the book well donut gave donut the book he put it up he was like where do I find what's the name of it it's like just type in z z
[39:36] Colts alien womb Z Colts alien womb now we're getting into Moon children right homunculus maybe I don't know bro yeah you yeah yeah yeah right
[39:52] there I gotta weave on this entire thing that we're on right now because the the marenian dynasty was the ruling family of the Franks from around the middle of the fifth century until 7
[40:04] 751 they first appear as the kings of the Franks in the Roman army of North Gaul so we're on the topic of movies all right and I just seen this because I'm a
[40:18] I'm a big alien fan okay and they just dropped the trailer for alien romalis oh oh let me tell you what that's about but go ahead go ahead well I mean
[40:32] romalis right the the founder of Rome that was born from what huh like a she wolf or something or other I mean shef I've been do that's been my research I've been
[40:46] talking about it bro I've been talking about how the harbar brothers and the and Joe Joe Biden and his brother Joe Biden's real name is Joseph his brother name is James and check
[40:58] 8 16 24 8 + 8 is 16 8 + 16 is 24 so they got this jamatri going on here too bro 81624 wow I'm G have to look into that I didn't know this this trailer came out it dropped today I think oh it came out today that's why I told you bro we're
[41:17] cooking dog we're cooking right now we're cooking with gas dude we're we're going people are like let him talk have you seen Prometheus did you see Prometheus before one of my favorite movies bro oh my God yo I'm I'm I'm into that too
[41:30] though bro I like breaking down like the mythology of the xenomorph did the did the engineers create them or did the xenor create the crazy it's wild it's wild but um
[41:42] yeah but the the story um about ramus and Remis two brothers right this is gonna blow your this is gonna blow your mind the brothers are battling over the new world this new kingdom they're going to control whoever
[41:56] control or whoever wins this little bet they have the kingdom has to be named after their name so obviously we obviously we know rhal is won because his name Rome that's the name of the new world Kingdom so he's battling with his
[42:10] brother and guess what the reason why ramus decides to kill his his twin brother is because his BR he he built a wall around
[42:25] his little new country called Rome and his brother kept jumping Remis kept jumping over the wall doesn't that sound like the whole Trump Biden little war
[42:37] over the wall you see what I'm saying I see what you're saying Alien Invasion bro I don't know illegal aliens you know this is crazy bro this
[42:52] is crazy but um yeah I did a lot of research with the wolf as well because in the uh Championship the football championship it was the Huskies a wolf genus type of uh you know dog or whatnot
[43:06] going against the wolverines wolverines all and you know the Wolverines won of course but also there's a story pull up this story real quick um Kamala and
[43:19] Amala is another wol story it's yeah Cala like Kamala Harris and Amala and you probably don't know who Amala is but tell FAL children yes these two girls so
[43:34] you got two boys that was raised by wolves he also pull up yeah pull up the show Raised by Wolves after that it's a uh it's a crazy so let me read this a feral child is a human child who has
[43:47] lived away from Human contact from a very young age and has little or no experience of human care loving or social behavior and crucial human language feral children are confirmed by humans often parents raised
[44:01] by animals or isolated in the wild probably the best known story of pharaoh CH children is that of two girls Amala and Kam Kamala that's like Kamala Harris
[44:13] right who were raised by a She Wolf what bro I never heard about this dude and you said bro that's her there's a series there's a series called Raised by Wolves
[44:27] it's a Alien series about this AI that goes to a future planet and and has to raise these children this AI robot of a woman who got these ult abilities is crazy yeah yeah that's
[44:41] that's her right here yeah and it's the whole uh Genesis story they're robots and yeah that's the guy of the Mithra cult this this stuff gets crazy bro like you gotta watch this show if y'all haven't watched it you have to watch
[44:56] it's one of the top I heard it's the top Sci-Fi TV series of all time I've seen that in a lot of uh different you know little articles but there's that Eclipse right there Raised by Wolves there you go but the interesting thing who is a
[45:10] who is Amala if we have Kamala the real name of Doja cat is Amala and she came out with the song paint the town red and we had two red teams in the Super
[45:24] Bowl wow bro yeah the red alchemical marriage and Alchemy that's what that was all about the rubo yeah yeah yeah yeah bro what are you so all
[45:38] right golly Man 42 minutes in I feel like we I feel like we've we've been to the moon and back so oh we haven't been nowhere man we haven't even talked about anything I mean we just been just
[45:52] spitball so man that that movie I got I got to go check that check out that trailer all right all right which one the the alien one right the the right yeah yeah you got be excited with that yeah know and and let me read the the
[46:05] alien the like the the movie description cuz it's it's where we're talking about Bloodlines and all this crazy stuff so alien romalis or ralis however you say is an upcoming American Science
[46:19] Fiction horror film and the seventh installment of the alien franchise a standalone inter qu set between the events of aliens 1979 and Aliens
[46:33] 1986 and it is it says the story go the story sees a group of young people on a distant world who find themselves in a confrontation
[46:44] with the most terrifying life form in the universe bro so again it's going to be and and it was interesting that spider movie and if you know that the that the face huggers are like little
[47:00] spiders right they they start like little spiders it's interesting that in that movie Spaceman the way that they that they describe so Spaceman Adam
[47:13] Sandler the way that they describe the movie is half a year into a solo mission on the edge of a solar system an astronaut concern is helped by an ancient creature he discover covers in the
[47:27] bowels of a ship so ancient creature and right there that it's like how long has this thing even been around like it's like ancient creature plus it's like giving him wisdom in some sort of weird
[47:41] way they're hermetically sealed but it was still in there with him like why it was psychospiritual because I don't even know if it even existed was it a subconscious manifesting that's what I was wondering too bro that's what I I I
[47:55] think I said that on the show I was like was was it a hallucination the entire time because we see these movies over and right like these typical movies over and over again where the Entre like Fight Club like that's one of my favorites where it's like it always catches you off guard at the end like it
[48:08] wasn't even him it was projections of himself the entire movie right so yeah I I was wondering the same thing as you bro was it real was it not but the fact that it took him
[48:21] to the Alpha and the Omega is that maybe perhaps what the higs on is Onie like this the particle that is representative of right isn't the LF isn't that a story
[48:34] by George Lu Borges where it's like it's the beginning and ending in all of knowledge and all of the universe and all of reality in one little pin drop one little point and maybe that's why
[48:49] they go to so many extents here at CERN and all these different places because that's what that represents they tell us it's one thing but we know that's the exoteric we got to think above and beyond we're talking about people who run the world let's be honest they run
[49:04] the world right they're they're in power they got they got they got power so what if that's what the higs ban represents the beginning the end of all all of knowledge everything in one little just one
[49:17] little drop there's a subatomic it's very subatomic it's like um yeah the B the bosonic strings in physics it's like the smallest atomic
[49:32] structures that that that we can't even see and and they talk about how many dimensions like 20 22 23 Dimensions o explaining that yeah and borous Story the ALF is a point in space that
[49:46] contains all other points anyone who gazes into it can see everything in the universe from every angle simultaneously without distortion overlapping or
[49:58] confusion bro I got I got you pull up Madam well with talking spiders pull up Madam well she was she's like this um she's like okay the movie she's with
[50:13] Peter Peter Parker's uh Uncle Uncle Ben when he's young and she yeah it just came out the movie just came out it just came out a couple of weeks ago called Madam
[50:24] well and and yeah she she has this ability because she was bit by this spider in Peru this magic or this a cult spider I don't know this crazy spider she can go to the Future bro she can go
[50:39] she can go all the way to the Future and and and she can change the F she can change the past and she can change the future because she connects to the webs the destiny threads of the universe
[50:51] which are these webs that she can shoot she can shoot it out her heart and change your your damn future and [ __ ] whoow so I I also talked about how in
[51:04] every different spider verse the spider that bites that particular Spider-Man gives him a different Power every different Universe has its different spider so yeah that's why all the Spider-Man all have their own thing and
[51:19] they quite literally rule the Universe I mean they're they're overwatchers of the Multiverse I mean they're the ones that watch over it right they're the ones that are going in and helping stop things essentially and if you think
[51:33] about it's almost like a secret society because only a certain few were select that's why they left that one kid out they're like yo don't tell them about our group over here and they're like you guys didn't invite me like he was all pissed off about that but it's like cuz they're initiated and they all have
[51:47] their own thing within that other realm but I I know Multiverse they're in a Multiverse right so then other multi-dimensions and you remember doat had the spider on her
[52:01] Scarlet album and and um the interesting thing is is that in a uh Ken of Grant's book he
[52:12] speaks about nzi or Nazi one of the original Spider Gods is a African guy called n he's the god of stories and remember at the end of Loki I don't know if you seen Loki but he had has these
[52:27] webs at the end and he becomes Loki becomes the god of stories at the end of the series the last episode he becomes the God of all the entire Multiverse so the next Avenger movies Loki is going to
[52:41] be directly connected he he's he became a good guy fin one here yeah there there you go he sits with all these threads coming out of wow yeah and he he controls the Multiverse now he sits on a throne he can't move no more he
[52:55] sacrifices being like the Raven in in in the Game of Thrones right he kind of did something sort of the same where he sat like in the tree or something was it I don't remember but I mean it was something like that where he sacrifices something
[53:09] to be the R I think it was his eyesight or something where it's like what are you will it's almost like a FY imp P what are you willing to give up in order to be this overseer of reality in some
[53:21] sort of way exactly so it's always a sacrifice you know it's always sacrifice so he has to sacrifice that now he becomes the god of the he becomes God of stories but a n the original god in
[53:35] mythology is a a trickster deity who acquires the later form of jouti so so azi is a later form of jouti which is th you heard of th before the
[53:49] book of th and EM Emerald Tablets and th is the god of magic and wisdom the gods of magic so maybe all of these you know compared to the spiderverse the different Spider-Man that got all these
[54:03] Powers is it this yeah that's uh yeah is jouti no no no no no no no no uh uh it's a i it's uh jouti is is is th
[54:17] with a ey you can just type in uh oh th with an ie those like no no no no it's um no it's not that it's um jouti is spelled with a I not a y at the end but you can type in th they'll show you the

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
54:31] original name no you spelled it the right way the first time it's like d h e j some they'll show it in there yeah they'll have the name in there but uh F original yeah you see it right there you see it
[54:45] um no above in the italic or whatever it is says jouti the name of the the Egyptians jouti the Y yeah so it's also a God it's not just you know a a king or
[55:00] a place it's it's the god th this his original comedic name th is his Greek name it later becomes Hermes so oh yeah yeah yeah yeah Hermes and jeudi same
[55:14] person they're the same person the Ibis bird and look he's the god of writing science magic Art and judgment and he is he represents the higher consciousness of man he act he
[55:29] represents the magical consciousness of man and Ken of Grant was speaking about these these these connections to th all of The Magicians talk about th because
[55:40] th is one of the only deities in Egypt that predates all the way to Atlantis in The Emerald Tablets they speak about th all the way in Atlantis along with b and set and these other
[55:55] ones so so uh yeah it's it's crazy and I think you're right there's magical lineages you know going on did you see the movie Devil conspiracy this is a crazy one bro devil conspiracy the movie
[56:09] the movie came out at the end of last year it's called the devil conspiracy the devil conspiracy and it is about the Angel Michael locking Lucifer down in this
[56:22] realm and then these scientists in the VA there's the scientists working in the Vatican and they're trying to turn the shroud of Torin you know the Shroud they said Jesus yeah was printed on they're
[56:36] trying to take the DN DNA from the Shroud of Turin and and generate a clone of Jesus so Lucifer can inhabit the body of what what but look before you get to
[56:51] that they were showing how they they they were taking the greatest philosophers of all time bro they were naming some of your guys bro they're naming these Greek philosophers and they cloned them and made them into children
[57:03] in 2023 like there's one of the kids right there he was made from the DNA of one of the greatest violin musicians of all time iot the name of them and they
[57:16] they were selling the kids in front of this audience this billionaire audience they were going up it was like uh they were doing auctions 20 million 25 million 30 million selling these kids they're doing this in real life bro
[57:30] that's what I'm trying to tell you they're doing this 100% I'm trying to tell bro what yeah you bro you got a lot of time to be watching all these movies dog I actually I haven't even been watching a lot of
[57:43] movies bro I I kind of slacked off I've been like I'll be typing at work while looking at my tablet watching a movie all at the same time while reading something on another screen I'm trying to like multitask to be able to cram in all this stuff that I've been doing
[57:57] yeah I've been slacking bro honestly I used to watch at least five movies a month so here let's let's make it all right where do we even go back to bro so we
[58:10] got I feel like donut with so many shout outs to Donut with all these freaking tabs at the top there but let's all right so we got cetus we got the cedus ritual right maybe perhaps
[58:24] it's got something to do with how you're saying there's a new void that we talking about the void can we talk about that and then maybe is that what they is maybe the eclipse how you said isn't an eclipse and maybe
[58:39] something's going to open up figuratively or maybe literally or metaphysically like who who really knows I mean anymore but you talk about this this void or whatever it was that you
[58:51] had what was it you said in the text you said all right my next topic the bo is it boates or boot yeah yeah yeah boes and the cus constellation called the whale and it's connected to
[59:05] the story of Jonah biblically so we talked about that movie Jonah which I'll probably check it out and then I wanted to show you this yeah here we go here we go now now let's get back on track bro so the ancient Florida Mountain sites
[59:16] Mark stars of of cedus and here the this star map and it bro it lines up with and if you look at Ford it's like a little fish you know it does so it does look like a fish so the people in Florida were in the know they they were in the
[59:30] know about this the whole constellation everything and I'm a Pisces so it's like crazy and the Pisces the Pisces is the the portal isn't it it is it's the final It's the final
[59:44] zodiac but um yeah the 12th zodiac so the connection I made to super boy B Bo it's all polar symbolism shout out to Mario symbolic study it's all polar
[59:57] symbolism because the the ccus area it's like the darkest region of from what we can see from a human perspective the darkest region has the the Seven Sisters of pleades in the middle has Sirius has
[01:00:11] sirious star which is representative of the third pillar in Freemasonry the third pillar is the Sirius Star or the the interplanetary logos Consciousness the godhead is through the serious star even
[01:00:25] in the the when they show the UFO the tractor beam the the tractor beam represents the pole star is symbolic to the godhead which is the UFO ship which in hebraic text they always speak about
[01:00:40] these these type of ships called the yahita that everyone has their own sort of like ship or they it's not really it's like a vessel a a astral vessel that we have that that our soul connects
[01:00:53] to so there's this thing in in the out there there's B constellation in the center around um this new supervoid that they discovered over the past 10 years so it's this they call it the cold
[01:01:08] spot and the whole ritual with Israel was over this this uh concert called supernova supernova parallel and the concert was done by a
[01:01:20] group called Universe parallel and they're saying that this cold spot is is basically a parallel universe that has opened you know in this Dimension and now they're calling
[01:01:35] that region where the cold spot is by boes cedus is Bo cedus lyen and uh Draco it's like Draco cedus lyen and it's uh I can't remember the other one but they're
[01:01:48] calling it the the the the the um the the Babylonian [ __ ] of Revelations what it's called the lady of Revelations basically the Scarlet woman the Scarlet woman that's what they're calling the cold region now yeah
[01:02:03] they gave it a Biblical yeah yeah you can get this research you can um you can look into uh what his name Christopher the secret Sun Institute secret Sun Institute never
[01:02:17] heard of him oh man he's deep Bro uh I got his books forgot his name man but but shout out to him secret Sun Institute and and he he he gives the the breakdown of how these constellations is
[01:02:31] the reason why we going to these wars it's the reason why certain rituals have to go down you always hear these these names and these characters connected to a certain time frame which deals with the starfields and the lay lines below
[01:02:45] because just like you have these starfields above we have a system of spirituality within us the Kundalini the planet has a Kundalini there's the these
[01:02:56] bices these opening of portals that they build certain towns like the Township in different cities always have this polar this pole symbolism there's always a pole near the township which is giving
[01:03:11] reverence to the pole region that these constellations surround so all of the constellations surround this Center pole region where the Seven Sisters of the plates in the Syria star is and developing right next to this is this
[01:03:26] big open cold spot or super boy and they did a lot of rituals with this Israel war pertaining to the void that opened up in space so now everything is being
[01:03:41] reverenced to the Year of the Dragon this year and in the Bible the woman of Babylon rides the dragon the [ __ ] of Babylon rides on the dragon you remember and she gives birth
[01:03:55] to the Antichrist you know it's all bibliomancy is connected so and also see is called the dragon fish inadvertedly I don't know but it's it's it's a lot of
[01:04:07] reference to it do you think that because you're talking about pretty much Astro theology in some sort of way
[01:04:19] right because I and I for one and I don't think it's it's it's I'm not saying it's not a possibility but it's not as interesting when people break something down as
[01:04:32] simple like oh it's it's because of this it's because right the it's a it was a grand plasma event and that's what it looked like and that's why we have that sign I'm not saying it can't be that and the the plasma universe is one of my favorite theories all right I'm just
[01:04:47] saying I think it's something about that and plasma plasma entities which we'll get into here soon and while you're talking here I'm going to I'm going to look for a book that actually let me see if I have a copy of it somewhere but
[01:04:59] it's called the I think you have it the elanic language yes yes yes yo yo that was crazy the elanic language which it's it's about here y so let me pull it up here yeah pull that up pull a picture
[01:05:14] anyway I need to go back into that thank you for remind so this one the elanic Revelation which is Vincent Bridges and he even talked about right so we have these stories where like oh the plasma event that's why we
[01:05:29] have that sign which I'm not saying that's wrong but he talked about these ofanim which were again angels and he describes them as
[01:05:41] plasma based entities and there is this one lecture that he's doing in Prague where let's get into this here so all right all right how do how do I
[01:05:56] break this down I just my my mind is going a million miles an hour right now so we have these entities right and I and I think this is what was going on with Edward Kelly and John D because they were being presented this information and let me pull up here
[01:06:11] because it's all and it what made me think of it was this when you're talking about the supervoid I I Googled supervoid and it came up with this picture here right of this this void and
[01:06:22] it's making me think of so an noan handbook Vincent Bridges it's connected because John Dean John B and Edward Kell Kelly they were stying through these
[01:06:36] crystals crystals store photons and there's a a lantean theory of a ontological presence of uh DNA plasmas uh photons is a quantum
[01:06:51] entanglement in memory of communication to specific information or vast distances out in space so plasmas are entanglement machines basically so what they
[01:07:04] are I love Vincent Bridges now it's very advanced stuff and it's kind of complicated but essentially he breaks everything down
[01:07:17] when it comes to in noan as that the these entities were showing John deward Kelly how to piece together this hyper cube right yeah that they were then able to the
[01:07:32] language was to activate the the language is not only in your DNA and it's activated through your DNA what you were saying earlier about this genetic memory in some sort of weird way and that's the whole thing with I was playing Assassin's Creed the other night
[01:07:47] bro that's like the whole thing where like oh we're going to tap into your genetic memory and project you to that point in in time and you're going to be your ancestor bro what like
[01:08:00] yeah yeah yeah that's that's real stuff in this elanic Revelation there's another book too I got it I got it here too where he's talking about
[01:08:12] how the enoan language that is a real language by the way it's not constru it's a real language with you can translate and everything like it's been analyzed by linguist and all that and
[01:08:25] he's about how it's in our DNA encoded and these entities are able to extract this thing and and there are points in time where there right the Angels were like yo you got you got to make sure
[01:08:38] that you memorize the the alphabet next time we come back and then they hadn't he hadn't memorized Edward Kelly so he says that out of nowhere he's like clenching his head on the ground he's like my head is on fire my head is on
[01:08:52] fire and he feels like he's being squeezed and what happened was that the angel squeezed him and when he let him go Edward Kelly already knew the entire alphabet so it's
[01:09:05] like they could manipulate his DNA in some sort of way to activate this language within it okay and this this book is about that entire thing so Angelic science and end of time and the
[01:09:17] Libra the Libra loga which were the the the keys that were given to Dean Kelly by the angel noage and that's where you get the round uh tablet of naaj this is April 10 so 410 again that that date he
[01:09:32] came to him looking like an elizabethian Sun King holding a golden rod and standing on a crystal edge with his round table and the keys were given to them right the this this entire system of the athers which they never got to
[01:09:46] use as far as we know because we don't have those records we lost a lot of Records uh they were they were given this entire system now or they was stolen well yeah there
[01:09:59] yeah and so he was given to by nage and what was interesting about it was that this Libra logga is called it transfers to the speech of translates to the speech of God right and it's it's
[01:10:13] supposedly the original Book of Enoch of like the true enoan language the language that God used to create the universe itself like that was like the original thing and this is what they were being given
[01:10:26] now now vaj was like yo I got I'm going to tell you guys these and it's right here I'm going to tell you guys this this language right the the these things but here it is
[01:10:39] right here this isage uh also in receiving of the calls this is to be noted that they are to be uttered of me backward and of view and practice forward and this is Little
[01:10:52] Triangle John D these These are from directly from the a tribulation of Dr John D's actions by merri casabon this is the guy that found the stuff in the bottom false drawer of this cabinet bro
[01:11:06] after the maid had apparently burned all the other one that sounds like the nagamati and the Dead Sea Scrolls like somebody always finds it they need Kindle for their fire and they're just like I'm just burning these old tchs are
[01:11:18] you bro right so this is from that and merri casaban actually ended end up publishing this to discredit John D as like this which you know typical cultist Necromancer and he ended up putting all
[01:11:34] the stuff and that's what I got back here this is in physical form with all the tablets and everything three huge uh TS of all these conversations
[01:11:46] now D go I understand it for the efficiency of them else all things called would appear he's talking about the apocalypse if there were if the angel would have
[01:12:00] given it to them forward okay read reading it he would have brought forth the apocalypse okay from how powerful this text was and so and so hinder are
[01:12:15] proceeding and learning and this is just them going back and forth and it was a a painstaking process now here's another one where is talking
[01:12:25] to them here it is Mystical mystical call which follow in the practice of for the moving of the second table the Kings the ministers government so they were also being revealed how to quite literally manipulate governments in
[01:12:41] different parts of the world bro by using this these magic tablets again wild stuff so delivered by the spirit to render obedience and faithful Society wherein they will open the mysteries of their creation as far as shall be
[01:12:55] necessary and give you understanding of many thousand Secrets wherein you are yet but children for every table hath it his key every key open his gate and every gate being opened give giveth
[01:13:07] knowledge of himself of entrance and of the mysteries of those things where of he is an enclosure where in the Palaces you shall find things that are power as
[01:13:20] well to speak as to do for every Palace is above his City and every city above his entrance what does that sound like to you bro every Palace is above his City and every city is is above his
[01:13:34] entrance that sounds like we were talking about these hidden hyperspace palaces pal it's called them palaces in case some anyone's watching you know what I'm saying so the and this
[01:13:47] is bro this is this entity noaj that gave to them this essentially once once they put everything together all these tablets they start to form this hyper cube of some sort and then every different point
[01:14:00] of that hyper cube is a different again it gets very convoluted but they they're talking about Angelic science and this is Vincent Bridges I really wish I would have got to talk to him about all this
[01:14:12] stuff but this is what he claims to have used by the way and experienced the ofanim these entities and again I mean it's one of my
[01:14:25] favorite subjects but Vincent Bridges took it above and beyond so the Ed the the John de and Ed Kelly stuff is really fascinating and it's really complicated
[01:14:39] but this dude took above and beyond and now while you're talking I'm going to look for something that's going to tie all this in together bro yeah I mean yeah I think it it is real and the
[01:14:51] plasma or the Sciences of our our DNA having Angelic type of um resonances to what's above above us because these
[01:15:06] starfields are are intelligences of that whole Angelic Abode and there's classes of the Angelic AB abold that different people were able to make contact with so
[01:15:19] the old the old fanic you know classes of it they were called the s if you look into it the opan the gnostics called them called them the opans and you have the ofic they were called the wheels
[01:15:33] because in these planes when they communicated with them they took on the the shape of these spear these burning Spears or whatnot from what I read and it's just it's like a a transmittance of of information just
[01:15:49] like you said that there was a contraction with him and all of a sudden he knew the entire enochian Alpha that I think there is a way for them to pass these entities to pass information to us that would take us literally our
[01:16:03] lifetime in one instance so I got this here I've talked about this before it's one of my favorite parts of the John D
[01:16:16] enoan bro I don't know why they haven't made a freaking movie about these dudes bro like it's coming trust me bro I want like I honest honestly if I had the
[01:16:26] money bro starring Nick Cage as John D that would be the the and you know you know what's the craziest part that I could actually inquire about that like I could actually like I I I probably know
[01:16:41] the people right if only we knew somebody who knew to who knew Nick Cage right like I could probably inquire about like yo how much would it be to have Nick Cage be John D like man bro that would be something that would be
[01:16:55] something right there I wonder who's going to play Queen Elizabeth that'd be wild right that'd be wild so here we have this now vage guy again and so this is Friday
[01:17:08] April something April is right yeah yeah and they're having all these crazy crazy visions and they're being taken to this
[01:17:21] other spot and they are shown God okay they are shown God but God isn't the regular God that we all know and love Sky daddy sitting on a throne
[01:17:36] no God is a whale with many eyes the prophet took them up for they were they were become as dead Okay mind you and think about all these stories that this lines up with right all the stories that
[01:17:50] this lines up with now now now now now they were very religious there's thousands of well not thousands but numerous theories as to John de and or Kelly and you know Elly was a charlatan and
[01:18:05] they were all you know making all this up but bro there's so many records of this but anyways the prophet took them up for they were become as dead and suddenly the firmament and the waters
[01:18:17] were joined together and the whale came like unto a legion of storms or as the bottomless Cave of the north talk about the North Pole portals
[01:18:31] and all these different things when it is opened and she was full of eyes on of every side the prophet said stand still but they trembled the water sank and
[01:18:44] fell suddenly away for that the whale lay upon the hill roaring like a cave of lions and the prophet took them by the hands and led them to the wh's mouth
[01:18:55] saying go in but they trembled veniant he said unto them the second time go in and
[01:19:05] they dirt not dirt dirt not bro dirt [Music] not bro what dirt not bro there's no way what is
[01:19:21] that that's a d Ur s Durst n bro why' you have to kill the moment Anie we're getting to the juice D bro hold on I gotta you killed the moment Durst not no
[01:19:35] that's not even a word dir dir yeah I don't know they dirt not they're dirt not whatever who cares that that word if anyone knows what that means and he
[01:19:46] SW he swear unto them and they entered in so he's like yo get in [ __ ] right so and they entered and he lifted up his voice and cried mightily come away and
[01:20:00] lo they floated before him richer than an Emperor's throne for unto him that was naked were clothes given unto him was that was a child and a man where 12
[01:20:13] gates opened so bro they're going to this whale and reality is UN folding before them the gates have been
[01:20:29] open right when they go into this whale and they're H but dude like were they on on substances when they were experiencing this because this is this is really psychedelic bro you really think about it but I mean there's

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:20:43] something about prayer Anie whether you're Christian or not meditation let's call it that and these dudes were entering deep states of meditation out hours upon end I mean that's what he
[01:20:56] needed to do to be able to scry okay so 12 gates open and the prophet cried mightily and said this whale cannot die and lifted his voice again and said
[01:21:09] within this whale are many chambers and secrets Dwelling Places which I will divide be betwix you on the right side unto which was a child and
[01:21:22] now see here and now next page did it skip a page bro here we go and now you see this is bro this is original stuff right we're reading directly from the source dog
[01:21:36] like this is wow some good stuff bro right here so and now a man there are 12 open but unto thee that hath provided strange garments for thyself magical underwear maybe perhaps I don't know and
[01:21:48] not such as men used to wear I will give thee head heart and left side whole PL are 46 you shall enter and be possessed this day together we're
[01:22:02] talking about the Divine Androgen coming together right the opposite so be possessed this day together and behold the sun shall return again 21 times and in one year but not
[01:22:17] all at one time you shall depart hence into a dwelling that shall be all one where there is no end the place of comfort and inspe Glory I have said and then this is John D riding back but
[01:22:30] think about that this almost sounds like the the one the beginning and the end the one place and time it sounds like the movie Spaceman like when he gets to that one spot the Alpha and the Omega so
[01:22:43] John D replies as you have delivered us a parable Enigma or Prof prophecies f f i beseech you for the setting for of God
[01:22:55] his honor and glory to expound what is meant by the whale the naked man and the child the prophet in his name the naked man is D the child is Kelly the prince
[01:23:07] is the devil the hill is the world the waters are the bosom of God the four beasts are the four elements the 12 trees are the 12 parts of the heavens the whale is the spirit of God the
[01:23:21] chambers are the degrees of wisdom the Thunders and the winds are the ends of God his will and judgment so bro bro W
[01:23:34] always say man this this stuff gets me excited bro like the eso terorist he even breaks down like the esotericism here like it's crazy you know and even
[01:23:48] with you know he speaks about the elements I was just reading some theosophical text that reference the well and and you know the whole Blas thing yeah and the Elementals but it
[01:24:01] goes more in the Hindu Direction They Don't call them Angels they call them Davis you know the angels and Davis they're the same thing you know Angels or deavas and whatever Sanskrit language
[01:24:14] that is but whoa whoa so the spirit of God is the well and and also the and depending on which translation you read the first animal that the the first thing that was
[01:24:30] created here let me find it goly anyways I can't I try to click this one and God created the great whales in every living moving creature which the waters brought forth according to their kind this is Genesis 1:21 so
[01:24:43] that the King James version and God created the created great whales in every King James our boy King James and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged foul
[01:24:56] after his kind and God God saw it was good so Genesis bro God created the whales first and then here we have this entire thing which again this is just
[01:25:10] one little piece dog I mean i' dude I've I've spent hours and hours and hour and every time I go back look this this is all this is all their their their mystical I've spent hours bro reading
[01:25:23] and every time I pick one random spot it's like something wild I'm like what nobody's made bro I too bro I'm G reach out I'm gonna make this happen John D Edward
[01:25:35] Kelly starring Nicholas Cage and we'll find out who Edward Kelly can be all right right but find a coar bro that that's gonna be dope yeah man put that strip together bro put that strip
[01:25:48] together bro like for real that that'll be crazy they because they they made a movie of the AUA I think it was the Aubra melon ritual they made a movie about that the Aubra melon yeah Aubra
[01:26:01] melon ritual movie in that now the abelon the M the sage abber oh yeah I do remember that mov I haven't seen it I haven't seen it but they told me about it the ritual perform the movies is the
[01:26:14] Aubra melon operation a cult right attempted by gnostics such as Alistar Crowley so that's what that's it colors out of space that's with the girl she was doing an abraic ritual in the beginning of the
[01:26:27] movie was she I got I gotta Yeah Yeah by the by the by the late the the first scene in the movie as soon as the movie coming on she's doing an abraic ritual right yeah yeah yeah yeah yes yes
[01:26:42] she says it she said I got a and she had the ne namicon book with the with the angel names because the angel names are what activate the the Sanic language so these translations they were slowly
[01:26:55] dictated Etc ET I don't have the the screenshot but check this out so within the 49 Pages the Logan now V explained were contained the mystical and holy voices of the Angels these tables were to be written by Galva and this is another entity Within These tables would
[01:27:10] be numbered the entire world and all its creatures to be delivered in five spans of this time this would be true the true cabala of nature or real cabala spoken of by by name by nage which D had long
[01:27:23] hypothesize cuz John D was asking him about a a book that he had if it was legitimate but right obviously wasn't so again bro this is this is wild and when
[01:27:36] you mentioned the whale stuff I was like I got something for you bro and that was great bro one of my favorite parts of the John D where it ties into with the whale and if you think about the whale
[01:27:49] and the story of Jonah right it's a it's an alchem vessel and what I was told shout out to Joel Thomas from free the rabbit podcast he told me that there's descriptions of
[01:28:04] the of the fish and it was actually transparent and it wasn't a fish it was it was a creature specifically made for Jonah right in that whole story I'd have to get the whole breakdown from him but
[01:28:17] he's told me about it before and it's like it's how chemical look at the whole Pinocchio story one of the movies he's in the in the whale right he got followed up by a whale one of the original movies I
[01:28:33] remember I don't know if it's comparative but I think uh you know over there they got the whale the whing wall maybe the the whing or the you know what is that the whing wall over there is that in Israel I I don't know what they
[01:28:47] got but maybe it is compared to something esoteric because I look at the whale and the swallowing of Jonah stayed up in there for what a week or something you know you know me personally days oh
[01:29:00] was three days well personally I think it it's it's esoteric you know maybe to me it's about three days three nights okay it's a swallowing
[01:29:12] of the spiritual World becoming physical that is is that esoteric to that or is it comparative to Jesus going three nights three days and his res Direction you
[01:29:26] know well and let's not let's not forget too we're missing one very important important movie that was all about what and we're talking about James Cameron inventing
[01:29:40] quot what the heck hold on whoopsies here we go now I was like looking at something complet so let's we're we're missing a very important movie you have James Cameron and what happens with the whales the whales are
[01:29:54] which they just communicated with they just came up with AI that was able to decipher whale and I think they were able to communicate with whales too I'm not I'm not sure about that but the the whales in this movie
[01:30:07] had an entire religion and they were being hunted for this anti-aging substance that was extracted from their brains which is if you it was
[01:30:21] the most valuable substance on Earth in in the movie and they were again it's very sounds like that stuff that rhymes with Google Chrome that they use right and
[01:30:35] that and essentially this stuff that they were extracting from these whales was here's the scene where they're hunting have you seen this movie yeah yeah I've seen it yeah yeah so the obviously they're great great great
[01:30:49] great thinking of that I I didn't even think about the whales up in there we had the whale with this guy what was that movie about cuz I I grew up watching monkey bone oh that the guy
[01:31:00] that that was in um monkey The Mummy yeah yeah yeah he the guy in The Mummy what what is his name again this day this is by a24 too Bren
[01:31:12] Frasier Brenan Frasier and it goes back to El Elizabeth Frasier too I I I'll have to break that down the whole CYO information constellations but wasn't this movie about him being so fat that he that he had to lose some weight or something like that yeah I thought it
[01:31:28] was going to be something that's so ter it probably is bro but it is it is I just saw Thomas in it it was something about Thomas and you know Thomas means twin was it Mo dick yeah yeah oh he saw
[01:31:41] he saw a bright look look look at look at the last line be dick bro right look at that last line look at that last sentence he said uh he be Charlie begins to float and he's engulfed by a a bright white light I haven't seen it so again I
[01:31:55] just know it was named whale it's by a24 which a24 has done a lot of ult movies okay we're talking about hereditary everything everywhere all at once which was super bizarre we have Midsummer x
[01:32:10] makina a whole bunch of different movies that uncut gems right we're talking about Adam Sandler and the whole thing I mean this movie was amazing uncut gems I yeah uncut G yeah that was a good movie I really liked it I mean that that was a really good movie but I think a24 is in
[01:32:24] that realm of cursed movies uh that they that they're able to tap into the occult but yeah the whale symbolism of in this movie really stood out to me how whales have this
[01:32:37] entire mythology and religion and they're able to live an entire life right and the fact that the substance was the elixir of
[01:32:52] Life essentially is what it was it was it was rejuvenating people and it was the most expensive on Earth so I don't know what to make of any of this dude like I said free Willie free
[01:33:07] Willie now we got to do Illuminati whales oh God we got we got we got to do that with donut bro Illuminati whales free Willie doing the the oneeyed symbolism over
[01:33:19] here yikes dude listen bro what what else speak speaking of that you seen that that Nickelodeon documentary come out I did see something about that I haven't watched it but yeah I did see about I I
[01:33:33] can't watch that stuff but um freaking out yeah I've seen a lot of symbolism with with with with that and I learned some crazy stuff we have probably talk about that off air but the Dan Schneider
[01:33:47] dude you know he's I don't know if he's if he's with the you know the J o I'm not sure if he is maybe Marvel guy no Dan Schneider was like the guy
[01:34:01] overon you know yeah he was a guy that was pulling all the streams and everything I think you're talking about Z is it the the what's the Zack Schneider you talking about the Justice League guy yeah that guy yeah n Dan
[01:34:15] Schneider was the guy over Nickelodeon and they figured out that the word Nickelodeon means um I don't care about God did you hear did you see that I saw you post that I think yeah and you remember when all of the kids I'm just
[01:34:31] talking about from the free Willie thing I don't know if was free Willie on Nickelodeon I think I saw that on Nickelodeon I think it was a separate movie company but uh these kids that play in these movies like a lot of them they were forced to do these roles
[01:34:45] that's that's coming out in documentary they didn't want to do the roles so it goes back to the devil conspiracy that most of these kids I don't know if some of them are randomly selected or maybe just like in the show did you see the
[01:34:57] boys yet I said we to Haven bro bro you got to see the boys man you have to see the boys and it was a spin-off to the boys where they showed how these people get their powers the government comes in
[01:35:11] and offers their parent a a big check they get this check and basically yeah they get this lump lump sum of cash then their kids are injected with this chemical and then then the kid get these powers
[01:35:26] and then they sent them to this this school the boys about that yeah the boys all of the super characters in there but there's another spin-off that just came out called Generation V I think Generation V is the
[01:35:40] spin-off you got to see watch the boys first the new season about to come out in a couple of months and then watch Generation V gen V I think it's called gen V and it's going to show the backstory to how the kids get their
[01:35:54] powers and it makes me think of the same devil conspiracy that maybe some there's there's some intelligent agencies of occult secret societies investing in DNA from specific people that can be paid I
[01:36:10] don't know if they're in Hollywood I don't know if there're that's what the NFL is all about the nefm NFL right the nefl you know that whole thing I and I was talking about this when I whenever I
[01:36:24] went on the confessionals is is the overtime episode we got into that whole thing where some of these sports leagues these people are different right not not different like they're bigger statue they're they're more athletic they're the perfect
[01:36:38] soldiers maybe right like like the perfect specimen if you will look at LeBron bro LeBron still looks good bro he and how old is he now like he's he's got to be an alien or clone or something
[01:36:50] bro he's like 40 he like 40 years old still dunking like look at Mike Tyson the hunkules bro bro right yeah he looks like a freaking nature dude and mind you that Tyson fought a good amount of his
[01:37:04] career under hypnosis okay so he's like straight up M yeah 100% MK that's why he went off the rails when I think it was Constantine I think is the name of the the his his
[01:37:17] coach died right so bro I'm just saying yeah well his name was was please don't tell me that so hold on I'll tell you right now what his name was Mike
[01:37:29] Tyson train was something Constantine so oh Lord KZ de Amato Constantine KZ de Amato his name was Constantine bro again I'm just I'm just I'm just here to make connections dude I'm not here to say
[01:37:43] nothing his name is Michael like the angel I'm just here to stay I'm just here to say stuff Anie I'm not here to do anything else bro whatever you want to do with this information it's up to you it's up to you bro okay but mind you
[01:37:58] the Golems what's what's the Golems aren't that bright and I'm just saying right I'm just saying bro I'm not trying to be mean on this episode I've said a lot of mean stuff on this episode I'm not proud of it but that's hilarious
[01:38:11] Mike's not that bright all right that's just no he's not no no no he's not he's not I mean we all we all thought something was you know a cup of strews was loose looking a little bit like ice spice if you get I'm what I'm saying
[01:38:24] here in this picture okay I'm just you know the whole conspiracy has been going around with ice spice and yeah oh my God you're you're hilarious bro I'm just I love I love watching old
[01:38:38] Mike Tyson videos right in his prime dog it was just I love boxing just but this dude was hypnotizing him before every fight we just did a video on hypnotism and the study of mesmerism on the Illuminati vampire it's going to come
[01:38:54] out soon and how it goes back to the Jesuits you know those Jesuit people even there's a picture of of the original Constantine he looks like the head of NASA like the head of NASA might be a clone of Constantine literally I got a picture if you line them up was that whole movie you just showed me bro
[01:39:09] that they were doing what they were taking the DNA and making the kids bro yeah and we keep saying you know they call them Time Travelers you know they' been showing these pictures of people you know these celebrities look just like these people from the past you know
[01:39:23] Keana Reeves looks like uh not Michelangelo but there's like pictures of him looking like these famous artists from back then like he looks just like them bro and they're like is he a time

[01:39:48] um AI created version of his of his face really yeah I think I could pull it I could send it to you but it's like a AI uh version of his face that been circulating the internet and everything
[01:40:01] people was like yo this dude look just like the guy he looks just like uh the head of NASA which is what you were which is what you were saying bro it's not too far away from the truth like the truth is Stranger Than Fiction quite

 … [05:55] esoteric and oul themes in it if there is any and just have fun and that same night I went to sleep I woke up and homeboy was following me bro and i' I've been following this guy for like 2 and a half years so what are the what are the chances of that happening you know what
[06:09] I'm saying like what are the chances of that lining up the way it did that's crazy bro because let me tell you something Nicholas Cage movie colors out of space did you guys
[06:22] talk about that yo that was one of the most ult esoteric movies of all time bro if
[06:35] nobody has seen that movie well you I mean the movie may disturb you in some spots because y'all remember y'all covered The Spider and the the mother and the son became a spider yeah bro yeah I know it was trippy and it's funny you're bringing this up because it's got
[06:51] to do with what we're going to talk about today because that was an HP Lovecraft movie and it was it was a Lovecraft movie yeah it was Necronomicon yeah yeah exactly so I think bro that Nick Cage reveals a lot of things in his
[07:05] movies and again Weston was talking about how they own original copies of elus Levi Crowley all these books so again I'm
[07:16] just saying they know about it and I I believe Nick Cage Mr Nick Cage is into the Paranormal spirituality and and the Occult I mean there's a reason why they they he grew up and and they owned a lot of haunted
[07:30] locations bro wow he own one of the most haunted mansions in in Louisiana dude really yeah really yeah well it
[07:42] doesn't surprise me because he has so many movies with esoteric messages and for you to have that connection bro you know kudos to you your platform that [ __ ] get a lot of um get a lot of views
 … [09:04] are unveiling and the more we dig deeper to what's occurring in 2024 the Year of the Dragon awesome make sure to go follow Anie over there and dude I'm excited for
[09:18] this one when we had originally connected we pushed back the date because you wanted to talk about some stuff then you hit me up I think it was yesterday or something and you're like I got this this and this and I named until
[09:31] right now the show the Cletus The Cletus The cus the cus ritual Soul Elementals and interdimensional space travel now the reason that cedus is important is
[09:45] because it lines up with Florida bro Florida really is the transmutational FIS of the United States okay its birthday was also 33
[09:59] so it was the Last Frontier we have it's the Sunshine State Disney World the most magical place on
[10:10] Earth Coral Castle you have NASA space x x marks the spot so many so many many things Onie and when you said cus I was
[10:23] like and that ties into the lovecraftian aspect because according to lenda the marsh and the swamps and Florida is the best place to manifest the great old
 … [12:33] Kelly when they were given the formula I guess to the athers and these athers are other dimensions okay that they never got to explore themselves but some things were revealed to them that happened before that that was
[12:49] interesting so take it away Anie like the the in noan Keys the talking about the E 328 okay yeah yeah there's a lot of uh interdimensional stuff speaking of Necronomicon astr Grim
[13:03] Wars uh is based upon these astr Grim Wars that lovecraft's father was collecting a lot of people don't know that he learned most of the names of the Great old ones from his father it's come
[13:16] from a Department of Defense documentation from a Liberian that that a military war like Liberian who was collecting these things and this the guy happened to work up under um Michael
[13:30] Aquino who's passed away now yeah first the guy who was in Church of Satan went the Church of set Don web and those guys came out of him now Don web yeah yeah
[13:44] the the P one eyebrows and everything so and his wife Lilith Lilith of queeno and Don web now owns the Lovecraft
[13:56] Library wait what hold on hold on yeah let me pull up this specimen of a man this guy here bro look at this dude's eyebrows son eyebrow game on point look
[14:09] at this the evilest eyebrows of all time so or repeat that again one one more time you said that yeah I can go real in real in depth about it
[14:25] how his father he was a traveling man M lovecraft's father and he contract he contracted tertiary syphilis syphilis and when he was going through
[14:39] that he would yell out these names Kulu y because he had these collection of of grim Wars from these Arabian dark magic
[14:53] priests and it was called the hayat Alim one of the original astr Rim Wars of the Stars how to connect with Cosmic intelligences and everything so he had that in his life he had a massive ult
[15:06] Library so when he died they lost all of their Fortune now but the library went the Lovecraft so he grew up reading these books but he would hear his father recite these names so basically make a long story short when Lovecraft got hit
[15:21] with his I don't know brain aneurism or whatever I think I think he was taking out personally but um l aino and Don web they now own the
 … [17:29] scholarship way deep in my videos people say I need to stop doing that but um okay so the seed is called the dragon fish right in Mesopotamia is called
[17:40] thite mes and that's the dragon goddess this is the original Dragon goddess of Sumeria that whole area is this constellation now why is this constellation important the eclipse this year the path
[17:56] of totality is the name of the eclipse it passes directly over a town in Texas called Jonah so this is the biblo mancy I I I speak about I don't know how these
[18:10] people do it because even the path of the eclipse from 2017 20 there was another one in like 2021 there was another one in earlier in 20 I mean late in 2023 now we have one
[18:24] coming it makes the Paleo hebraic um uh what you call it symbols of the word twab and Al in Hebrew it it literally
[18:40] makes the symbols I have you know photos and everything but the top of the eclipse is going to start in a town called Jonas and you know about the story of Jonas being
 … [19:48] movie wow yeah I broke it down too yeah I want to get into some spider stuff is I got some stuff from Kenneth Grant that I used to look into that really sparked my mind when I saw you guys video I
 … [23:13] cedus has be has been depicted throughout history by many um whatever the name of the people who name the constellations and he's been he's been
[23:26] given several animal bodies was mainly a pisan body with animal different animal heads attached to his form so this led me to do some research
[23:39] so I'm typing stuff now and I come across this movie called Jona and I'm trying to figure out okay there's a movie coming out called Jonah it's a alien movie there's an alien
[23:51] movie it comes up and I said oh wow this is interesting this is cool so I click and I figure out the mov movie came out the day before you know I'm looking at it it's already out I know so I went and
 … [35:11] that the the people came out of the sea or these monsters came out of found it bro I found it here you go even even better bro we're talking about Bloodlines and all that stuff right ready sorry to cut you off Anie but here we go here we go were the marenian
[35:25] descendants from a monster meet the quinar so half man half B never mind quinar anyways but but in this line of thought in early Frankish history there
[35:37] was a beast of Neptune which was said to look like a creature called a quinar the mysterious mythical being only appeared in one text but he was said to have fed a line of Kings whose descendants still survive today and they even made an
[35:52] appearance in The Da Vinci Code so that the the same L of thinking of what we're talk what we were just talking about these Bloodlines not from from look at that I mean it's it's like a freaking who's
[36:06] this guy but affir mention the mysterious monster Beast of Neptune is a quinar half yeah quinar C monster yeah bro dog and this would make sense why all these Elites why they all have
 … [38:31] everything no no because there's a genetic you talking about genetic access code there's a woman on Instagram I want you guys to follow I think her name is like Claire nchra it's like NRA vadic astrology and she does videos on those women with the eyes or or specific
[38:46] cheekbones she goes through all the Hollywood women and she shows like a deity compared to very astrology to the constellations of where why do they have this type of face like how do we get our
[38:57] genetic imprints is all related to the starfields of the the way that we look I'm talking about how your face your cheekbones your lips all of this is all astrological you know and and yeah
[39:10] there's a genetic access code I speak about the first Zar coats or the first men that ate meat the Zar coats there's a book on them called Zar coats the alien wounds because their women they said their women used to get pregnant
 … [44:41] that's her right here yeah and it's the whole uh Genesis story they're robots and yeah that's the guy of the Mithra cult this this stuff gets crazy bro like you gotta watch this show if y'all haven't watched it you have to watch
[44:56] it's one of the top I heard it's the top Sci-Fi TV series of all time I've seen that in a lot of uh different you know little articles but there's that Eclipse right there Raised by Wolves there you go but the interesting thing who is a
[45:10] who is Amala if we have Kamala the real name of Doja cat is Amala and she came out with the song paint the town red and we had two red teams in the Super
[45:24] Bowl wow bro yeah the red alchemical marriage and Alchemy that's what that was all about the rubo yeah yeah yeah yeah bro what are you so all
[45:38] right golly Man 42 minutes in I feel like we I feel like we've we've been to the moon and back so oh we haven't been nowhere man we haven't even talked about anything I mean we just been just
[45:52] spitball so man that that movie I got I got to go check that check out that trailer all right all right which one the the alien one right the the right yeah yeah you got be excited with that yeah know and and let me read the the
[46:05] alien the like the the movie description cuz it's it's where we're talking about Bloodlines and all this crazy stuff so alien romalis or ralis however you say is an upcoming American Science
[46:19] Fiction horror film and the seventh installment of the alien franchise a standalone inter qu set between the events of aliens 1979 and Aliens
[46:33] 1986 and it is it says the story go the story sees a group of young people on a distant world who find themselves in a confrontation
[46:44] with the most terrifying life form in the universe bro so again it's going to be and and it was interesting that spider movie and if you know that the that the face huggers are like little
 … [51:33] about it's almost like a secret society because only a certain few were select that's why they left that one kid out they're like yo don't tell them about our group over here and they're like you guys didn't invite me like he was all pissed off about that but it's like cuz they're initiated and they all have
[51:47] their own thing within that other realm but I I know Multiverse they're in a Multiverse right so then other multi-dimensions and you remember doat had the spider on her
[52:01] Scarlet album and and um the interesting thing is is that in a uh Ken of Grant's book he
[52:12] speaks about nzi or Nazi one of the original Spider Gods is a African guy called n he's the god of stories and remember at the end of Loki I don't know if you seen Loki but he had has these
[52:27] webs at the end and he becomes Loki becomes the god of stories at the end of the series the last episode he becomes the God of all the entire Multiverse so the next Avenger movies Loki is going to
 … [56:22] realm and then these scientists in the VA there's the scientists working in the Vatican and they're trying to turn the shroud of Torin you know the Shroud they said Jesus yeah was printed on they're
[56:36] trying to take the DN DNA from the Shroud of Turin and and generate a clone of Jesus so Lucifer can inhabit the body of what what but look before you get to
[56:51] that they were showing how they they they were taking the greatest philosophers of all time bro they were naming some of your guys bro they're naming these Greek philosophers and they cloned them and made them into children
[57:03] in 2023 like there's one of the kids right there he was made from the DNA of one of the greatest violin musicians of all time iot the name of them and they
[57:16] they were selling the kids in front of this audience this billionaire audience they were going up it was like uh they were doing auctions 20 million 25 million 30 million selling these kids they're doing this in real life bro
 … [01:05:14] anyway I need to go back into that thank you for remind so this one the elanic Revelation which is Vincent Bridges and he even talked about right so we have these stories where like oh the plasma event that's why we
[01:05:29] have that sign which I'm not saying that's wrong but he talked about these ofanim which were again angels and he describes them as
[01:05:41] plasma based entities and there is this one lecture that he's doing in Prague where let's get into this here so all right all right how do how do I
[01:05:56] break this down I just my my mind is going a million miles an hour right now so we have these entities right and I and I think this is what was going on with Edward Kelly and John D because they were being presented this information and let me pull up here
 … [01:13:47] is bro this is this entity noaj that gave to them this essentially once once they put everything together all these tablets they start to form this hyper cube of some sort and then every different point
[01:14:00] of that hyper cube is a different again it gets very convoluted but they they're talking about Angelic science and this is Vincent Bridges I really wish I would have got to talk to him about all this
[01:14:12] stuff but this is what he claims to have used by the way and experienced the ofanim these entities and again I mean it's one of my
[01:14:25] favorite subjects but Vincent Bridges took it above and beyond so the Ed the the John de and Ed Kelly stuff is really fascinating and it's really complicated
[01:14:39] but this dude took above and beyond and now while you're talking I'm going to look for something that's going to tie all this in together bro yeah I mean yeah I think it it is real and the
 … [01:15:33] because in these planes when they communicated with them they took on the the shape of these spear these burning Spears or whatnot from what I read and it's just it's like a a transmittance of of information just
[01:15:49] like you said that there was a contraction with him and all of a sudden he knew the entire enochian Alpha that I think there is a way for them to pass these entities to pass information to us that would take us literally our
[01:16:03] lifetime in one instance so I got this here I've talked about this before it's one of my favorite parts of the John D
[01:16:16] enoan bro I don't know why they haven't made a freaking movie about these dudes bro like it's coming trust me bro I want like I honest honestly if I had the
[01:16:26] money bro starring Nick Cage as John D that would be the the and you know you know what's the craziest part that I could actually inquire about that like I could actually like I I I probably know
 … [01:18:05] they were all you know making all this up but bro there's so many records of this but anyways the prophet took them up for they were become as dead and suddenly the firmament and the waters
[01:18:17] were joined together and the whale came like unto a legion of storms or as the bottomless Cave of the north talk about the North Pole portals
[01:18:31] and all these different things when it is opened and she was full of eyes on of every side the prophet said stand still but they trembled the water sank and
[01:18:44] fell suddenly away for that the whale lay upon the hill roaring like a cave of lions and the prophet took them by the hands and led them to the wh's mouth
[01:18:55] saying go in but they trembled veniant he said unto them the second time go in and
[01:19:05] they dirt not dirt dirt not bro dirt [Music] not bro what dirt not bro there's no way what is
[01:19:21] that that's a d Ur s Durst n bro why' you have to kill the moment Anie we're getting to the juice D bro hold on I gotta you killed the moment Durst not no
 … [01:20:29] open right when they go into this whale and they're H but dude like were they on on substances when they were experiencing this because this is this is really psychedelic bro you really think about it but I mean there's
[01:20:43] something about prayer Anie whether you're Christian or not meditation let's call it that and these dudes were entering deep states of meditation out hours upon end I mean that's what he
[01:20:56] needed to do to be able to scry okay so 12 gates open and the prophet cried mightily and said this whale cannot die and lifted his voice again and said
[01:21:09] within this whale are many chambers and secrets Dwelling Places which I will divide be betwix you on the right side unto which was a child and
[01:21:22] now see here and now next page did it skip a page bro here we go and now you see this is bro this is original stuff right we're reading directly from the source dog
 … [01:22:55] his honor and glory to expound what is meant by the whale the naked man and the child the prophet in his name the naked man is D the child is Kelly the prince
[01:23:07] is the devil the hill is the world the waters are the bosom of God the four beasts are the four elements the 12 trees are the 12 parts of the heavens the whale is the spirit of God the
[01:23:21] chambers are the degrees of wisdom the Thunders and the winds are the ends of God his will and judgment so bro bro W
[01:23:34] always say man this this stuff gets me excited bro like the eso terorist he even breaks down like the esotericism here like it's crazy you know and even
[01:23:48] with you know he speaks about the elements I was just reading some theosophical text that reference the well and and you know the whole Blas thing yeah and the Elementals but it
[01:24:01] goes more in the Hindu Direction They Don't call them Angels they call them Davis you know the angels and Davis they're the same thing you know Angels or deavas and whatever Sanskrit language
 … [01:35:40] spin-off you got to see watch the boys first the new season about to come out in a couple of months and then watch Generation V gen V I think it's called gen V and it's going to show the backstory to how the kids get their
[01:35:54] powers and it makes me think of the same devil conspiracy that maybe some there's there's some intelligent agencies of occult secret societies investing in DNA from specific people that can be paid I
[01:36:10] don't know if they're in Hollywood I don't know if there're that's what the NFL is all about the nefm NFL right the nefl you know that whole thing I and I was talking about this when I whenever I
 … [01:36:38] soldiers maybe right like like the perfect specimen if you will look at LeBron bro LeBron still looks good bro he and how old is he now like he's he's got to be an alien or clone or something
[01:36:50] bro he's like 40 he like 40 years old still dunking like look at Mike Tyson the hunkules bro bro right yeah he looks like a freaking nature dude and mind you that Tyson fought a good amount of his
[01:37:04] career under hypnosis okay so he's like straight up M yeah 100% MK that's why he went off the rails when I think it was Constantine I think is the name of the the his his
[01:37:17] coach died right so bro I'm just saying yeah well his name was was please don't tell me that so hold on I'll tell you right now what his name was Mike
[01:37:29] Tyson train was something Constantine so oh Lord KZ de Amato Constantine KZ de Amato his name was Constantine bro again I'm just I'm just I'm just here to make connections dude I'm not here to say

[26:05] this kid the kid who plays Jonah CL no it's not her it's not her that's not it um their last name is um what is his last name I just had it up here we
 … [30:11] he's a he's a film he's a film produc he has his film own film company and he travels around the world and gets these stories these strains of cult stories and someone wants him to do a alien one
[30:25] alien abduction story and he was like a that nobody's going to listen to that but then he has a dream and remembers that when he was young he told people that he was abducted too I don't mean I don't want to be mean
[30:40] but I don't want to be mean but this kid kind of looks like cedus he kind of looks like a sea monster right when you I'm just saying all right come on
[30:53] bro he looks a little he just here I'm gonna pull up cedus and I want you to see the constellation uhhuh and he looks like bro can't tell me doesn't look like
[31:06] that a little bit yeah I'm not hey I I get it bro hey it be it be Stranger than what you know though listen bro because listen listen Annie
 … [35:52] appearance in The Da Vinci Code so that the the same L of thinking of what we're talk what we were just talking about these Bloodlines not from from look at that I mean it's it's like a freaking who's
[36:06] this guy but affir mention the mysterious monster Beast of Neptune is a quinar half yeah quinar C monster yeah bro dog and this would make sense why all these Elites why they all have
[36:21] submarine licenses right yeah right here here we go look br I did a whole video on how gizen Maxwell she owns a company called
[36:34] teramac that's all about the submarine she owns submarine teramar my bad it's like submarine she had these submarine uh connections through her father who worked for the Messi the CIA intelligence of Israel and J uh Joe
[36:49] Biden's brother James Biden he owns water Island right next to Epstein Island and it used to be a submarine Bas yeah it was in the trust it's called water Island we're speaking about water and the name of the island is called
 … [41:30] though bro I like breaking down like the mythology of the xenomorph did the did the engineers create them or did the xenor create the crazy it's wild it's wild but um
[41:42] yeah but the the story um about ramus and Remis two brothers right this is gonna blow your this is gonna blow your mind the brothers are battling over the new world this new kingdom they're going to control whoever
[41:56] control or whoever wins this little bet they have the kingdom has to be named after their name so obviously we obviously we know rhal is won because his name Rome that's the name of the new world Kingdom so he's battling with his
[42:10] brother and guess what the reason why ramus decides to kill his his twin brother is because his BR he he built a wall around
[42:25] his little new country called Rome and his brother kept jumping Remis kept jumping over the wall doesn't that sound like the whole Trump Biden little war
[42:37] over the wall you see what I'm saying I see what you're saying Alien Invasion bro I don't know illegal aliens you know this is crazy bro this
 … [45:52] spitball so man that that movie I got I got to go check that check out that trailer all right all right which one the the alien one right the the right yeah yeah you got be excited with that yeah know and and let me read the the
[46:05] alien the like the the movie description cuz it's it's where we're talking about Bloodlines and all this crazy stuff so alien romalis or ralis however you say is an upcoming American Science
[46:19] Fiction horror film and the seventh installment of the alien franchise a standalone inter qu set between the events of aliens 1979 and Aliens
[46:33] 1986 and it is it says the story go the story sees a group of young people on a distant world who find themselves in a confrontation
[46:44] with the most terrifying life form in the universe bro so again it's going to be and and it was interesting that spider movie and if you know that the that the face huggers are like little
 … [51:33] about it's almost like a secret society because only a certain few were select that's why they left that one kid out they're like yo don't tell them about our group over here and they're like you guys didn't invite me like he was all pissed off about that but it's like cuz they're initiated and they all have
[51:47] their own thing within that other realm but I I know Multiverse they're in a Multiverse right so then other multi-dimensions and you remember doat had the spider on her
[52:01] Scarlet album and and um the interesting thing is is that in a uh Ken of Grant's book he
[52:12] speaks about nzi or Nazi one of the original Spider Gods is a African guy called n he's the god of stories and remember at the end of Loki I don't know if you seen Loki but he had has these
[52:27] webs at the end and he becomes Loki becomes the god of stories at the end of the series the last episode he becomes the God of all the entire Multiverse so the next Avenger movies Loki is going to
 … [54:03] Powers is it this yeah that's uh yeah is jouti no no no no no no no no uh uh it's a i it's uh jouti is is is th
[54:17] with a ey you can just type in uh oh th with an ie those like no no no no it's um no it's not that it's um jouti is spelled with a I not a y at the end but you can type in th they'll show you the
[54:31] original name no you spelled it the right way the first time it's like d h e j some they'll show it in there yeah they'll have the name in there but uh F original yeah you see it right there you see it
[54:45] um no above in the italic or whatever it is says jouti the name of the the Egyptians jouti the Y yeah so it's also a God it's not just you know a a king or
[55:00] a place it's it's the god th this his original comedic name th is his Greek name it later becomes Hermes so oh yeah yeah yeah yeah Hermes and jeudi same
[55:14] person they're the same person the Ibis bird and look he's the god of writing science magic Art and judgment and he is he represents the higher consciousness of man he act he
[55:29] represents the magical consciousness of man and Ken of Grant was speaking about these these these connections to th all of The Magicians talk about th because
[55:40] th is one of the only deities in Egypt that predates all the way to Atlantis in The Emerald Tablets they speak about th all the way in Atlantis along with b and set and these other
[55:55] ones so so uh yeah it's it's crazy and I think you're right there's magical lineages you know going on did you see the movie Devil conspiracy this is a crazy one bro devil conspiracy the movie
[56:09] the movie came out at the end of last year it's called the devil conspiracy the devil conspiracy and it is about the Angel Michael locking Lucifer down in this
[56:22] realm and then these scientists in the VA there's the scientists working in the Vatican and they're trying to turn the shroud of Torin you know the Shroud they said Jesus yeah was printed on they're
[56:36] trying to take the DN DNA from the Shroud of Turin and and generate a clone of Jesus so Lucifer can inhabit the body of what what but look before you get to
[56:51] that they were showing how they they they were taking the greatest philosophers of all time bro they were naming some of your guys bro they're naming these Greek philosophers and they cloned them and made them into children
[57:03] in 2023 like there's one of the kids right there he was made from the DNA of one of the greatest violin musicians of all time iot the name of them and they
[57:16] they were selling the kids in front of this audience this billionaire audience they were going up it was like uh they were doing auctions 20 million 25 million 30 million selling these kids they're doing this in real life bro
 … [01:06:36] crystals crystals store photons and there's a a lantean theory of a ontological presence of uh DNA plasmas uh photons is a quantum
[01:06:51] entanglement in memory of communication to specific information or vast distances out in space so plasmas are entanglement machines basically so what they
[01:07:04] are I love Vincent Bridges now it's very advanced stuff and it's kind of complicated but essentially he breaks everything down
[01:07:17] when it comes to in noan as that the these entities were showing John deward Kelly how to piece together this hyper cube right yeah that they were then able to the
[01:07:32] language was to activate the the language is not only in your DNA and it's activated through your DNA what you were saying earlier about this genetic memory in some sort of weird way and that's the whole thing with I was playing Assassin's Creed the other night
 … [01:14:00] of that hyper cube is a different again it gets very convoluted but they they're talking about Angelic science and this is Vincent Bridges I really wish I would have got to talk to him about all this
[01:14:12] stuff but this is what he claims to have used by the way and experienced the ofanim these entities and again I mean it's one of my
[01:14:25] favorite subjects but Vincent Bridges took it above and beyond so the Ed the the John de and Ed Kelly stuff is really fascinating and it's really complicated
[01:14:39] but this dude took above and beyond and now while you're talking I'm going to look for something that's going to tie all this in together bro yeah I mean yeah I think it it is real and the
[01:14:51] plasma or the Sciences of our our DNA having Angelic type of um resonances to what's above above us because these
[01:15:06] starfields are are intelligences of that whole Angelic Abode and there's classes of the Angelic AB abold that different people were able to make contact with so
 … [01:15:33] because in these planes when they communicated with them they took on the the shape of these spear these burning Spears or whatnot from what I read and it's just it's like a a transmittance of of information just
[01:15:49] like you said that there was a contraction with him and all of a sudden he knew the entire enochian Alpha that I think there is a way for them to pass these entities to pass information to us that would take us literally our
[01:16:03] lifetime in one instance so I got this here I've talked about this before it's one of my favorite parts of the John D
[01:16:16] enoan bro I don't know why they haven't made a freaking movie about these dudes bro like it's coming trust me bro I want like I honest honestly if I had the
[01:16:26] money bro starring Nick Cage as John D that would be the the and you know you know what's the craziest part that I could actually inquire about that like I could actually like I I I probably know
[01:16:41] the people right if only we knew somebody who knew to who knew Nick Cage right like I could probably inquire about like yo how much would it be to have Nick Cage be John D like man bro that would be something that would be
[01:16:55] something right there I wonder who's going to play Queen Elizabeth that'd be wild right that'd be wild so here we have this now vage guy again and so this is Friday
[01:17:08] April something April is right yeah yeah and they're having all these crazy crazy visions and they're being taken to this
[01:17:21] other spot and they are shown God okay they are shown God but God isn't the regular God that we all know and love Sky daddy sitting on a throne
[01:17:36] no God is a whale with many eyes the prophet took them up for they were they were become as dead Okay mind you and think about all these stories that this lines up with right all the stories that
[01:17:50] this lines up with now now now now now they were very religious there's thousands of well not thousands but numerous theories as to John de and or Kelly and you know Elly was a charlatan and
 … [01:31:41] he saw a bright look look look at look at the last line be dick bro right look at that last line look at that last sentence he said uh he be Charlie begins to float and he's engulfed by a a bright white light I haven't seen it so again I
[01:31:55] just know it was named whale it's by a24 which a24 has done a lot of ult movies okay we're talking about hereditary everything everywhere all at once which was super bizarre we have Midsummer x
[01:32:10] makina a whole bunch of different movies that uncut gems right we're talking about Adam Sandler and the whole thing I mean this movie was amazing uncut gems I yeah uncut G yeah that was a good movie I really liked it I mean that that was a really good movie but I think a24 is in
[01:32:24] that realm of cursed movies uh that they that they're able to tap into the occult but yeah the whale symbolism of in this movie really stood out to me how whales have this
[01:32:37] entire mythology and religion and they're able to live an entire life right and the fact that the substance was the elixir of
[01:32:52] Life essentially is what it was it was it was rejuvenating people and it was the most expensive on Earth so I don't know what to make of any of this dude like I said free Willie free
[01:33:07] Willie now we got to do Illuminati whales oh God we got we got we got to do that with donut bro Illuminati whales free Willie doing the the oneeyed symbolism over
 … [01:40:57] stormor as well as boom and I hit him with all the different links and this one was in Israel think about it because I just did a go I just did a Golem video and Israel Israel scientists create

[04:19] thumbs up subscribe all that good stuff and today we have Anie joining us again what up bro what up bro what's been going going on you se you seen my episode with Nick
[04:33] Cage's son bro how How how Wild was that dude no I missed that one when did that come out an episode ago so episode 198 I had Weston cage on bro how did I miss
 … [05:55] esoteric and oul themes in it if there is any and just have fun and that same night I went to sleep I woke up and homeboy was following me bro and i' I've been following this guy for like 2 and a half years so what are the what are the chances of that happening you know what
[06:09] I'm saying like what are the chances of that lining up the way it did that's crazy bro because let me tell you something Nicholas Cage movie colors out of space did you guys
[06:22] talk about that yo that was one of the most ult esoteric movies of all time bro if
[06:35] nobody has seen that movie well you I mean the movie may disturb you in some spots because y'all remember y'all covered The Spider and the the mother and the son became a spider yeah bro yeah I know it was trippy and it's funny you're bringing this up because it's got
[06:51] to do with what we're going to talk about today because that was an HP Lovecraft movie and it was it was a Lovecraft movie yeah it was Necronomicon yeah yeah exactly so I think bro that Nick Cage reveals a lot of things in his
[07:05] movies and again Weston was talking about how they own original copies of elus Levi Crowley all these books so again I'm
[07:16] just saying they know about it and I I believe Nick Cage Mr Nick Cage is into the Paranormal spirituality and and the Occult I mean there's a reason why they they he grew up and and they owned a lot of haunted
[07:30] locations bro wow he own one of the most haunted mansions in in Louisiana dude really yeah really yeah well it
[07:42] doesn't surprise me because he has so many movies with esoteric messages and for you to have that connection bro you know kudos to you your platform that [ __ ] get a lot of um get a lot of views
 … [09:04] are unveiling and the more we dig deeper to what's occurring in 2024 the Year of the Dragon awesome make sure to go follow Anie over there and dude I'm excited for
[09:18] this one when we had originally connected we pushed back the date because you wanted to talk about some stuff then you hit me up I think it was yesterday or something and you're like I got this this and this and I named until
[09:31] right now the show the Cletus The Cletus The cus the cus ritual Soul Elementals and interdimensional space travel now the reason that cedus is important is
[09:45] because it lines up with Florida bro Florida really is the transmutational FIS of the United States okay its birthday was also 33
[09:59] so it was the Last Frontier we have it's the Sunshine State Disney World the most magical place on
[10:10] Earth Coral Castle you have NASA space x x marks the spot so many so many many things Onie and when you said cus I was
[10:23] like and that ties into the lovecraftian aspect because according to lenda the marsh and the swamps and Florida is the best place to manifest the great old
 … [12:33] Kelly when they were given the formula I guess to the athers and these athers are other dimensions okay that they never got to explore themselves but some things were revealed to them that happened before that that was
[12:49] interesting so take it away Anie like the the in noan Keys the talking about the E 328 okay yeah yeah there's a lot of uh interdimensional stuff speaking of Necronomicon astr Grim
[13:03] Wars uh is based upon these astr Grim Wars that lovecraft's father was collecting a lot of people don't know that he learned most of the names of the Great old ones from his father it's come
[13:16] from a Department of Defense documentation from a Liberian that that a military war like Liberian who was collecting these things and this the guy happened to work up under um Michael
[13:30] Aquino who's passed away now yeah first the guy who was in Church of Satan went the Church of set Don web and those guys came out of him now Don web yeah yeah
[13:44] the the P one eyebrows and everything so and his wife Lilith Lilith of queeno and Don web now owns the Lovecraft
[13:56] Library wait what hold on hold on yeah let me pull up this specimen of a man this guy here bro look at this dude's eyebrows son eyebrow game on point look
[14:09] at this the evilest eyebrows of all time so or repeat that again one one more time you said that yeah I can go real in real in depth about it
[14:25] how his father he was a traveling man M lovecraft's father and he contract he contracted tertiary syphilis syphilis and when he was going through
[14:39] that he would yell out these names Kulu y because he had these collection of of grim Wars from these Arabian dark magic
[14:53] priests and it was called the hayat Alim one of the original astr Rim Wars of the Stars how to connect with Cosmic intelligences and everything so he had that in his life he had a massive ult
[15:06] Library so when he died they lost all of their Fortune now but the library went the Lovecraft so he grew up reading these books but he would hear his father recite these names so basically make a long story short when Lovecraft got hit
[15:21] with his I don't know brain aneurism or whatever I think I think he was taking out personally but um l aino and Don web they now own the
 … [17:29] scholarship way deep in my videos people say I need to stop doing that but um okay so the seed is called the dragon fish right in Mesopotamia is called
[17:40] thite mes and that's the dragon goddess this is the original Dragon goddess of Sumeria that whole area is this constellation now why is this constellation important the eclipse this year the path
[17:56] of totality is the name of the eclipse it passes directly over a town in Texas called Jonah so this is the biblo mancy I I I speak about I don't know how these
[18:10] people do it because even the path of the eclipse from 2017 20 there was another one in like 2021 there was another one in earlier in 20 I mean late in 2023 now we have one
[18:24] coming it makes the Paleo hebraic um uh what you call it symbols of the word twab and Al in Hebrew it it literally
[18:40] makes the symbols I have you know photos and everything but the top of the eclipse is going to start in a town called Jonas and you know about the story of Jonas being
 … [19:48] movie wow yeah I broke it down too yeah I want to get into some spider stuff is I got some stuff from Kenneth Grant that I used to look into that really sparked my mind when I saw you guys video I
 … [23:13] cedus has be has been depicted throughout history by many um whatever the name of the people who name the constellations and he's been he's been
[23:26] given several animal bodies was mainly a pisan body with animal different animal heads attached to his form so this led me to do some research
[23:39] so I'm typing stuff now and I come across this movie called Jona and I'm trying to figure out okay there's a movie coming out called Jonah it's a alien movie there's an alien
[23:51] movie it comes up and I said oh wow this is interesting this is cool so I click and I figure out the mov movie came out the day before you know I'm looking at it it's already out I know so I went and
 … [35:11] that the the people came out of the sea or these monsters came out of found it bro I found it here you go even even better bro we're talking about Bloodlines and all that stuff right ready sorry to cut you off Anie but here we go here we go were the marenian
[35:25] descendants from a monster meet the quinar so half man half B never mind quinar anyways but but in this line of thought in early Frankish history there
[35:37] was a beast of Neptune which was said to look like a creature called a quinar the mysterious mythical being only appeared in one text but he was said to have fed a line of Kings whose descendants still survive today and they even made an
[35:52] appearance in The Da Vinci Code so that the the same L of thinking of what we're talk what we were just talking about these Bloodlines not from from look at that I mean it's it's like a freaking who's
[36:06] this guy but affir mention the mysterious monster Beast of Neptune is a quinar half yeah quinar C monster yeah bro dog and this would make sense why all these Elites why they all have
 … [38:31] everything no no because there's a genetic you talking about genetic access code there's a woman on Instagram I want you guys to follow I think her name is like Claire nchra it's like NRA vadic astrology and she does videos on those women with the eyes or or specific
[38:46] cheekbones she goes through all the Hollywood women and she shows like a deity compared to very astrology to the constellations of where why do they have this type of face like how do we get our
[38:57] genetic imprints is all related to the starfields of the the way that we look I'm talking about how your face your cheekbones your lips all of this is all astrological you know and and yeah
[39:10] there's a genetic access code I speak about the first Zar coats or the first men that ate meat the Zar coats there's a book on them called Zar coats the alien wounds because their women they said their women used to get pregnant
 … [44:41] that's her right here yeah and it's the whole uh Genesis story they're robots and yeah that's the guy of the Mithra cult this this stuff gets crazy bro like you gotta watch this show if y'all haven't watched it you have to watch
[44:56] it's one of the top I heard it's the top Sci-Fi TV series of all time I've seen that in a lot of uh different you know little articles but there's that Eclipse right there Raised by Wolves there you go but the interesting thing who is a
[45:10] who is Amala if we have Kamala the real name of Doja cat is Amala and she came out with the song paint the town red and we had two red teams in the Super
[45:24] Bowl wow bro yeah the red alchemical marriage and Alchemy that's what that was all about the rubo yeah yeah yeah yeah bro what are you so all
[45:38] right golly Man 42 minutes in I feel like we I feel like we've we've been to the moon and back so oh we haven't been nowhere man we haven't even talked about anything I mean we just been just
[45:52] spitball so man that that movie I got I got to go check that check out that trailer all right all right which one the the alien one right the the right yeah yeah you got be excited with that yeah know and and let me read the the
[46:05] alien the like the the movie description cuz it's it's where we're talking about Bloodlines and all this crazy stuff so alien romalis or ralis however you say is an upcoming American Science
[46:19] Fiction horror film and the seventh installment of the alien franchise a standalone inter qu set between the events of aliens 1979 and Aliens
[46:33] 1986 and it is it says the story go the story sees a group of young people on a distant world who find themselves in a confrontation
[46:44] with the most terrifying life form in the universe bro so again it's going to be and and it was interesting that spider movie and if you know that the that the face huggers are like little
 … [51:33] about it's almost like a secret society because only a certain few were select that's why they left that one kid out they're like yo don't tell them about our group over here and they're like you guys didn't invite me like he was all pissed off about that but it's like cuz they're initiated and they all have
[51:47] their own thing within that other realm but I I know Multiverse they're in a Multiverse right so then other multi-dimensions and you remember doat had the spider on her
[52:01] Scarlet album and and um the interesting thing is is that in a uh Ken of Grant's book he
[52:12] speaks about nzi or Nazi one of the original Spider Gods is a African guy called n he's the god of stories and remember at the end of Loki I don't know if you seen Loki but he had has these
[52:27] webs at the end and he becomes Loki becomes the god of stories at the end of the series the last episode he becomes the God of all the entire Multiverse so the next Avenger movies Loki is going to
 … [56:22] realm and then these scientists in the VA there's the scientists working in the Vatican and they're trying to turn the shroud of Torin you know the Shroud they said Jesus yeah was printed on they're
[56:36] trying to take the DN DNA from the Shroud of Turin and and generate a clone of Jesus so Lucifer can inhabit the body of what what but look before you get to
[56:51] that they were showing how they they they were taking the greatest philosophers of all time bro they were naming some of your guys bro they're naming these Greek philosophers and they cloned them and made them into children
[57:03] in 2023 like there's one of the kids right there he was made from the DNA of one of the greatest violin musicians of all time iot the name of them and they
[57:16] they were selling the kids in front of this audience this billionaire audience they were going up it was like uh they were doing auctions 20 million 25 million 30 million selling these kids they're doing this in real life bro
 … [01:05:14] anyway I need to go back into that thank you for remind so this one the elanic Revelation which is Vincent Bridges and he even talked about right so we have these stories where like oh the plasma event that's why we
[01:05:29] have that sign which I'm not saying that's wrong but he talked about these ofanim which were again angels and he describes them as
[01:05:41] plasma based entities and there is this one lecture that he's doing in Prague where let's get into this here so all right all right how do how do I
[01:05:56] break this down I just my my mind is going a million miles an hour right now so we have these entities right and I and I think this is what was going on with Edward Kelly and John D because they were being presented this information and let me pull up here
 … [01:13:47] is bro this is this entity noaj that gave to them this essentially once once they put everything together all these tablets they start to form this hyper cube of some sort and then every different point
[01:14:00] of that hyper cube is a different again it gets very convoluted but they they're talking about Angelic science and this is Vincent Bridges I really wish I would have got to talk to him about all this
[01:14:12] stuff but this is what he claims to have used by the way and experienced the ofanim these entities and again I mean it's one of my
[01:14:25] favorite subjects but Vincent Bridges took it above and beyond so the Ed the the John de and Ed Kelly stuff is really fascinating and it's really complicated
[01:14:39] but this dude took above and beyond and now while you're talking I'm going to look for something that's going to tie all this in together bro yeah I mean yeah I think it it is real and the
 … [01:15:33] because in these planes when they communicated with them they took on the the shape of these spear these burning Spears or whatnot from what I read and it's just it's like a a transmittance of of information just
[01:15:49] like you said that there was a contraction with him and all of a sudden he knew the entire enochian Alpha that I think there is a way for them to pass these entities to pass information to us that would take us literally our
[01:16:03] lifetime in one instance so I got this here I've talked about this before it's one of my favorite parts of the John D
[01:16:16] enoan bro I don't know why they haven't made a freaking movie about these dudes bro like it's coming trust me bro I want like I honest honestly if I had the
[01:16:26] money bro starring Nick Cage as John D that would be the the and you know you know what's the craziest part that I could actually inquire about that like I could actually like I I I probably know
 … [01:18:05] they were all you know making all this up but bro there's so many records of this but anyways the prophet took them up for they were become as dead and suddenly the firmament and the waters
[01:18:17] were joined together and the whale came like unto a legion of storms or as the bottomless Cave of the north talk about the North Pole portals
[01:18:31] and all these different things when it is opened and she was full of eyes on of every side the prophet said stand still but they trembled the water sank and
[01:18:44] fell suddenly away for that the whale lay upon the hill roaring like a cave of lions and the prophet took them by the hands and led them to the wh's mouth
[01:18:55] saying go in but they trembled veniant he said unto them the second time go in and
[01:19:05] they dirt not dirt dirt not bro dirt [Music] not bro what dirt not bro there's no way what is
[01:19:21] that that's a d Ur s Durst n bro why' you have to kill the moment Anie we're getting to the juice D bro hold on I gotta you killed the moment Durst not no
 … [01:20:29] open right when they go into this whale and they're H but dude like were they on on substances when they were experiencing this because this is this is really psychedelic bro you really think about it but I mean there's
[01:20:43] something about prayer Anie whether you're Christian or not meditation let's call it that and these dudes were entering deep states of meditation out hours upon end I mean that's what he
[01:20:56] needed to do to be able to scry okay so 12 gates open and the prophet cried mightily and said this whale cannot die and lifted his voice again and said
[01:21:09] within this whale are many chambers and secrets Dwelling Places which I will divide be betwix you on the right side unto which was a child and
[01:21:22] now see here and now next page did it skip a page bro here we go and now you see this is bro this is original stuff right we're reading directly from the source dog
 … [01:22:55] his honor and glory to expound what is meant by the whale the naked man and the child the prophet in his name the naked man is D the child is Kelly the prince
[01:23:07] is the devil the hill is the world the waters are the bosom of God the four beasts are the four elements the 12 trees are the 12 parts of the heavens the whale is the spirit of God the
[01:23:21] chambers are the degrees of wisdom the Thunders and the winds are the ends of God his will and judgment so bro bro W
[01:23:34] always say man this this stuff gets me excited bro like the eso terorist he even breaks down like the esotericism here like it's crazy you know and even
[01:23:48] with you know he speaks about the elements I was just reading some theosophical text that reference the well and and you know the whole Blas thing yeah and the Elementals but it
[01:24:01] goes more in the Hindu Direction They Don't call them Angels they call them Davis you know the angels and Davis they're the same thing you know Angels or deavas and whatever Sanskrit language
 … [01:35:40] spin-off you got to see watch the boys first the new season about to come out in a couple of months and then watch Generation V gen V I think it's called gen V and it's going to show the backstory to how the kids get their
[01:35:54] powers and it makes me think of the same devil conspiracy that maybe some there's there's some intelligent agencies of occult secret societies investing in DNA from specific people that can be paid I
[01:36:10] don't know if they're in Hollywood I don't know if there're that's what the NFL is all about the nefm NFL right the nefl you know that whole thing I and I was talking about this when I whenever I
 … [01:36:38] soldiers maybe right like like the perfect specimen if you will look at LeBron bro LeBron still looks good bro he and how old is he now like he's he's got to be an alien or clone or something
[01:36:50] bro he's like 40 he like 40 years old still dunking like look at Mike Tyson the hunkules bro bro right yeah he looks like a freaking nature dude and mind you that Tyson fought a good amount of his
[01:37:04] career under hypnosis okay so he's like straight up M yeah 100% MK that's why he went off the rails when I think it was Constantine I think is the name of the the his his
[01:37:17] coach died right so bro I'm just saying yeah well his name was was please don't tell me that so hold on I'll tell you right now what his name was Mike
[01:37:29] Tyson train was something Constantine so oh Lord KZ de Amato Constantine KZ de Amato his name was Constantine bro again I'm just I'm just I'm just here to make connections dude I'm not here to say
