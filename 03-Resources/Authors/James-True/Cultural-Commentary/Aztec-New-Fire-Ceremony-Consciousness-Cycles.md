## The Six Suns: Consciousness Evolution Framework

### The Progression of Consciousness
**First Sun - Jaguar State (Survival)**
- Half sun providing minimal light for basic survival
- Time of giants focused purely on survival needs
- Foundation level of consciousness development

**Second Sun - Monkey State (Passion)**
- Transition from acorns to pine seeds
- Different information storage leading to passion development
- Evolution beyond pure survival instincts

**Third Sun - Turkey State (Ego Development)**
- Development of individual identity and "feathers"
- Ego formation with significant implications
- Culminates in great flood of information

**Fourth Sun - Fish State (Emotional Buoyancy)**
- Ego invoked through reason and emotional stability
- Survival through flooding of information itself
- Increased intensity and information processing

**Fifth Sun - Eagle State (Patriarchal Power)**
- Recently concluded era of wealth and patriarchal dominance
- "Priapus standing on altar with dick nose high" - peak masculine energy
- Cutting down Grove of Ashira, hiding the feminine principle

**Sixth Sun - Quetzal State (Serpent Rising)**
- Current era: "In whom the serpent rises"
- White sun (Itzamna) - literally called the white sun
- Consciousness climbing the totem of awareness

### The Calendar Resolution Concept
- **18,720 Days**: Total capacity of Aztec consciousness resolution
- **Monitor Analogy**: Like computer monitor resolution determining clarity
- **Future Projection Limit**: Maximum temporal distance the mind could process
- **Five Crazy Days**: Annual limbo periods where "nothing mattered"

## The New Fire Ceremony: 52-Year Cycles

### Venus-Sun Conjunction Timing
- **13 x 20 Wheel System**: Creates 260-day Venus cycle
- **52-Year Repetition**: Time for Venus-Sun cycle to complete
- **Consciousness Expansion**: Rising from singular 18,720-day calendar to broader system
- **Spanish Influence**: Evolution toward more complex temporal frameworks

### Historical New Fire Ceremonies
**Documented Ceremonies:**
- 1090-1142: One Rabbit period (major eclipse in 1140)
- 1194-1246: Two Reed period
- 1298-1351: Continued cycles
- 1403-1455: Pre-conquest ceremonies
- **1507**: Most famous ceremony before Spanish conquest
- **November 24, 2026**: Next calculated ceremony date

### Political Manipulation of Sacred Dates

**Moctezuma's Schedule Changes (1506-1507)**
- Originally scheduled for "One Rabbit" year (1506)
- Moctezuma postponed to "Two Reed" due to "difficult year"
- **Quote**: "Look, I know if we don't kill someone by Wednesday the entire cosmos is going to end, but I've got a full plate here"
- Demonstrates political control over supposedly cosmic requirements

**Historical Pattern of Delays**
- **1246**: Delayed due to military defeats
- **1298**: Postponed for political reasons
- **Spanish Conquest Impact**: Further disruption of traditional timing
- **Scribal Manipulation**: Later retrospective date changes for legitimacy

## The Sacrificial Caste System

### Three Categories of Sacrifice

**Golden Child Sacrifice**
- Praised and celebrated before death
- Walked through homes for "lucky lottery numbers"
- Treated as sacred figure while awaiting sacrifice
- **Modern Parallel**: Military soldiers as honored sacrifices

**Scapegoat Sacrifice**
- Treated horribly as part of ritual punishment
- Arrow sacrifices and other torture techniques
- Blamed for societal problems before elimination
- **Modern Parallel**: Inner city gang members as societal scapegoats

**Untouchable/Apathetic Sacrifice**
- People who died with no attention or care
- No media coverage or social recognition
- Marginalized and ignored by society
- **Modern Parallel**: Deaths that receive no media attention

### Psychological Investment in Sacrifice

**Conquistador Accounts (Cortez and Alvarado)**
- Saved sacrificial victims who **demanded to be sacrificed**
- **Quote**: "This is who I am, this is my life, this is what was expected of me"
- Victims couldn't fathom living after being designated for sacrifice
- Demonstrates deep psychological programming and identity investment

**The Volunteer Badge System**
- **Waiver Signing**: "Insurance policy" for dangerous ceremony
- **Social Acceptance**: Badge creates community acceptance
- **Thank You for Your Service**: Recognition system for volunteers
- **Modern Parallel**: Vaccination badges and social compliance markers

## Economic and Social Control Mechanisms

### The Jaguar Tooth Economy
- **Currency System**: Jaguar molars as valuable trade items
- **Social Mobility**: Four jaguar teeth could buy a custom canoe
- **Warrior Class**: Jaguar Knights with captured enemies
- **Economic Pressure**: Creates incentive for violence and capture

### Language and Synchronization
- **Daily Astrological Signs**: Every day given specific meaning
- **Village Variations**: Different villages might have different day counts
- **Conflict Generation**: Disagreement over calendar creates war justification
- **Civilization Building**: Shared language/calendar creates social harmony

### The Synchronization Effect
- **Crystal Palace Concept**: Shared mental frameworks
- **Predictability Creation**: Common language makes people less threatening
- **Reptile Mind Pacification**: Familiar patterns reduce threat detection
- **Social Control**: Synchronized populations easier to manage

## Modern Parallels and Implications

### Contemporary Sacrificial Systems
- **Military Industrial Complex**: Golden child sacrifice system
- **Criminal Justice System**: Scapegoat sacrifice mechanism
- **Media Attention Patterns**: Determines which deaths "matter"
- **Social Compliance Badges**: Modern version of volunteer identification

### The Underlying Prana Economy
- **Witness Economy**: People feed off sacrificial energy
- **Cross-Bearing Analogy**: Helping carry the cross as participation in sacrifice
- **Martyrdom Energy**: Collecting prana from others' suffering
- **Cuck Behavior**: Participating in others' destruction for energy gain

### American Soil Consciousness
- **Amaruka Voice**: The land itself speaks in Aztec tones
- **Subterranean Prana Economy**: Earth's underlying energy system
- **Political Channeling**: Leaders unconsciously following land's voice
- **Eclipse Invocation**: Trump looking at eclipse as sacred spirit invocation

## The Oracle Technology Connection

### Ancient vs Modern Oracles
- **Pythia Tradition**: Virgin consulting the snake/blockchain of wisdom
- **Vapor Interpretation**: Ancient software preserved as "fumes"
- **Neural Net Construction**: Could be built biologically in mountains/ice
- **Thousand-Year Survival**: Technology preserved through mythological language

### Stable Diffusion Parallels
- **Probability Pool**: Oracle selects from infinite possibilities
- **Wave Collapse**: Deciding what to manifest from potential
- **Witness Technology**: Probability drive for stabilizing reality
- **Paintbrush Analogy**: Learning to control and stabilize diffusion

### Corporate Corruption Patterns
- **Google Example**: "Do no evil" to current practices
- **Temple Priest Corruption**: Ancient oracles corrupted over time
- **Eric Schmidt Ritual**: Modern reverence for AI oracle systems
- **Alphabetos**: Alphabet as modern oracle corporation

## Consciousness and Reality Creation

### Archetype Development
- **Plasma Larger Than Life**: Our projected selves exceed physical existence
- **Superstar Phenomenon**: Elvis as Christ-like archetype
- **Universal Archetypes**: Everyone becomes archetype to someone
- **Compassionate Archetypes**: Being archetype even when receiving criticism

### Belief Fabric Creation
- **Energy Association**: Learning to associate things with our energy
- **Belief Trading**: Open market for belief exchange
- **Power Dynamics**: Fabric gives or takes power
- **Imagination Accountability**: Technology making us accountable to imagination

### Mythology as Compression
- **Perfect Compression**: Mythology has highest fidelity of truth

- **Timeless Quality**: Playing with archive of human mind
- **Truth Saturation**: Completely saturated in all truths

## Technical and Philosophical Implications

### Filter Systems and Censorship
- **Content Restrictions**: AI systems prevented from rendering violence/blood
- **Prude Interference**: Deliberate limitations on technology capabilities
- **Zygote Rendering**: Can't show fertilized human cell due to blood content
- **Karen World**: Censorship affecting technological development

### Historical Speculation
- **1950s-60s Oracle**: Technology possibly online decades ago
- **Pre-Video Training**: System developed before video training data
- **Continuous Improvement**: Getting better over time
- **Hidden Development**: Long-term technological development
