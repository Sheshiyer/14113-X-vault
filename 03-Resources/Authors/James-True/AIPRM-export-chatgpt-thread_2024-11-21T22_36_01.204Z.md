[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] I want to start with fast brain slow brain uh tonight what is a pretty famous book actually called uh Thinking Fast thinking slow I believe is what it's
[00:13] called and it basically uh breaks down this this concept of the two different brains that are that are living inside of you uh and when I say two I I literally do mean too uh we can definitely talk about multiple
[00:27] personalities later it's a really important factor to a lot of what's going on but I want you to know that your equipment itself that there's a piece of thinking equipment inside your brain sort of like a mobile phone and that that this mobile phone this device
[00:40] that's plugged into your bios into your body has two very distinct operating systems that that rarely meet each other that are completely independent of each
[00:52] other have their own history have their own uh vitality and sense of uh retribution engines of of things that they that they're looking for their own quests their own Destinies and that
[01:05] these could be uh seen the Shadows can be seen through this concept of fast brain slow brain and the thinking fast is this reptile brain but it's it's when I say reptile I really mean more your motor
[01:20] brain the cerebellum the very base root of your brain many of of uh the thinking about what intell Ence is seems to dismiss a lot of the cerebellum because they call it well
[01:34] this is just your motor cortex so there's no Destiny inside of here and that there's no free will inside of here but really all the you could look at the base of your brain the very root of your
[01:48] brain is is that all the wisdom that's carmalized over eons and that that wisdom is just so tried and true that it gets put in this SP special place which is directly next
[02:02] to the phalus directly next to the primary control mechanisms of your entire system why are they next to it because they have been
[02:15] granted Faith your body believes in your Mastery of your motor functions so much
[02:26] so that it says no neocortex you were not capable or equipped for doing the kinds of things that I already know how to do far better than you could ever even
[02:40] imagine and so we end up placing these things that we are the best at at at our core level at our most core root so the reptile is a kind of
[02:55] perfection it's a kind of energetic Perfection the coldblooded mammal is coldblooded because it would be perfect if it could exist in any
[03:09] environment and that the only way it could perfectly exist in any of these environments is by matching the temperature but still finding a way to sustain its memory its Consciousness its
[03:21] thoughtful day-to-day processes through the treacherous changes of temperature as we've discussed before warm-blooded invention is an invention
[03:33] of your ecosystem of your sematic system that said hey if we are arrogant enough to think that we can create our own [ __ ] ecosystem inside our
[03:47] arms and that we can carry warmth in our arms 247 with so much fortitude so much Perfection that it gets built into the nosis of our sarabellum and that's what
[04:02] you've done you've carried this warmth with you for this eons and it's gotten so thick and such an essence of you that it has become this separate entity this fast
[04:16] brain 2 plus two is a fast brain response 2 plus two is four it's a fast brain response there's
[04:27] no reason or or waste of time needed to send that information farther up the chain of command no reason to do it in fact if
[04:40] you do it you're violating the protocol of our bureaucracy you do not bring a complaint about the cafeteria to the CEO you don't do it it's not going to work
[04:53] but the CEO should care no no I no it's not how you do it this is a giant Oyen Corporation and you are lost in the
[05:08] bureaucracy of the vastness of your own soul the intricacies of Euros siren life are so huge so vast that you require a
[05:21] natural biological guia AI intelligence g a a intelligent bureaucracy to dictate how you will even communicate with your own body this gives you an asynchronous
[05:36] connection to the entire network from a single IP so it's not even a bad thing and how this system works is going to be through your Triune brain through these three brains that we've been discussing
[05:50] and the quickest way to recognize and understand the Triune brain in you is to see it Shadow and to watch it work 2 plus 2 that that's you that's your
[06:02] ID your psychological ID the fist in your brain the fist that's inside your brain right this is the father of Prometheus
[06:14] this is the brother of Atlas this is the essential now there is no past there is no future there is ID and it says 2 + 2 is four there is not experience that led
[06:28] you to the neurological Trail to divulge the truth that 2+ 2 is four because there is no longer a need to have a neurological map to build you a journey
[06:41] from 2 plus 2 is four why because it's happened so many times you've been asked so many times your brain has rewarded you so many times with the same amount of dopamine that the concept of gambling
[06:55] itself has reduced that answer to a motor response and this is why we lose the essence of identity by dismissing it as reflex
[07:13] reflex is nosis reflex is not the loss of Free Will reflex is the Perfection of
[07:25] decision it's very difficult to understand how this works from a free will perspective because you're looking at the record needle and the record and they're both
[07:39] exactly in the same place at all times and so you have no choice but to insist that the record must be predestined the needle that the record is guiding the needle through its grooves and that the
[07:52] needle has no choice but to play it sound this is a natural inclination of believing in the HUD that surrounds you you are immersed
[08:06] inside one of the most intricate living situations that we've ever
[08:17] seen the vast nature of where you live is so complex that there is this neurological Highway and that this highway has three
[08:31] different systems built into it that give you directions into a bureaucracy that is your body it's a bureaucracy you can't even
[08:43] have a neocortex decision about something without every single chemical in your body weighing in on it first these kinds of things make it harder for you to see your reptile
[08:57] because you think that your repti tile is somehow invisible in the needle of now but this fist this Central you this
[09:10] fast brain is so in tune with Destiny that the needle will always be where the record plays it's why you trust that part of you the most you trust that part of you the most because you know it
[09:24] finds the most symbiosis by riding the grooves of time itself why because that would be the most coldblooded [ __ ] thing you could do think about it you is the needle playing yourself
[09:40] through time the most coldblooded Gnostic I'm here I [ __ ] accept it all thing you could do is just write it out no matter how cold no matter how hot no matter how
[09:52] loud no matter how bumpy no matter how Honky Tonk the music is you're there for it this is the ID of you the ID does not
[10:06] have a desire to change the ID finds you having a desire to be one of the worst wastes of resources and time that you could ever
[10:19] imagine the ID is insisting why are you turning your back on weather on strife and on the noise itself that is
[10:31] reality why are you so insistent that the sounds that you hear sound like more like babbling Brooks instead of screaming children burning in a fire right that all these preferences that
[10:44] you have are so intrinsically anti-id that the ID can never even fathom this mishmash of ghosting that you think you are and so it doesn't it literally says
[10:57] I'm not you you're not me both of you make a mutual decision to decide I don't know who the [ __ ] you are and it looks like 2 plus 2 is four and it looks like 17 time 24 what's 17
[11:11] time 24 H like probably one of you is like way to go but most of you were like I my Sarah Bellum doesn't have that answer my reptile doesn't have it you
[11:25] know what the reptile says who cares who the [ __ ] cares why do you want to know what 17 time 24 is when when is that going to happen when and you're like well hypothetically
[11:38] you could have 17 grasshoppers but but you but you're going to you've been asked if you could eat those 24 times because if you eat 17 grasshoppers 24 times your your meal's free and you're like if that the reptile's like if that happens I will be
[11:53] fine I do not need to have this formula worked out go away the is dismisses rejects the slow
[12:05] brain the fast brain is fast it is automatic It Is frequent it is stereotypical it is unconscious what do I mean by stereotypical it is the Candy
[12:17] Crush cellulose version of everything right the surfer boom you just had an image boom there's fast brain Valley
[12:30] Girl boom just had an image fast brain right Nazi boom fast brain okay these pulses these pulses are are cortical uh responses
[12:44] right are motor responses to the reflexology not of the rejection of whether or not something's true this is the movement of where we put our muscle in response to this
[12:57] reality that we will never qu question we will never question this the ID and your reflexes have a tighter alious I mean have a tighter Alliance than you
[13:10] do your it and your reflexes in the now are the rails on the train tracks in life right now they do not trust you at all and you see this Behavior every day and it's fine it gives you this beautiful kind of
[13:25] Freedom Fast braing says the object is at a greater distance than an another right crucial for hunting for gathering for foraging for meeting a lady for whatever it is that you need in
[13:40] in in your life to to respond to survival right your fast brain has a solution for it that it believes is the best because it's been tried over time and it insists this is what I think is going to work you have the ability to
[13:53] change what is installed in the fast brain but it is a long bureaucratic process that's going to involve you sending your changes to the House of Representatives having those looked at having those then sent over or maybe
[14:07] tabled to the Senate having the bipartisan [ __ ] happen back and forth and the entire time your neurological bureaucracy is arguing over whether or not this new trait should be allowed whether or not we really need to
[14:21] help this neocortex have more or less Donuts this is a huge decision it's so big and and you have these separate
[14:34] systems precisely because you cannot be trusted with all these things you can't you you used to eat your boogers some of you still do you cannot be trusted with these kind of things and it's
[14:48] okay it's it's why we were given this car right you come to Disney World you do not know have to know how the bumper cars work you don't you just you just
[15:00] get in it just works right it's it's it's very much like that the source of a specific sound the phrase War and Peace right the display of seeing a gruesome image this is very important believe it
[15:15] or not your facial uh signals are fast brain they're fast brain in fact when you're looking at actors you're looking at people that are
[15:29] simply sprinting neocortex sprinters that's what acting is acting is is I have to run and cover the face that's already there the moment I notice that I feel something that's what it is it's
[15:44] noticing I feel something and being embarrassed about it and running to cover the face so an actor isn't necessarily someone who's skilled at anything else except for running to their face and stopping whatever's
[15:56] already there this is fast brain this is fast brain and the reason why your face reacts before your mind does is part of the beauty of being symbiotic it's part of why your destiny
[16:11] is so difficult for so many of us including myself to to swallow the symbiosis is terrifying for us it's terrifying because it's pushing us into that rail into that that
[16:25] needle where it feels like we don't have free will where it feels like we're reflexing to the now and to what's happening because we're symbiotically just living in a giant chemical chamber and all the liquids that are
[16:40] being dumped from all the chemicals from all the aminos from all the proteins that is us we we could predetermine what would happen because you know what happens when you mix all this stuff together if you do enough math if you do
[16:53] enough simulation you know the only thing that's keeping this interesting is we don't exactly know yet thank God we're not that precise yet at predicting exactly what's going to happen if you put James in a room with this person or this person or that person if we knew
[17:06] all that I think this whole place would be over be no sense in having having anything at all so at the heart of of who you are is
[17:20] this mirrored Shadow Self between you and your Ed you and your Ed and even you is hard to to find because it's this past and this future machine and both of most of those past right the hindbrain and the forebrain the future are
[17:34] insisting that neither of them is the Ed so it's it's instead of three Spider-Mans pointing at each other it's three Spider-Mans pointing at at not each other at insisting it's not me well it's not me it's not me it's not me it's
[17:49] not me it's not me it's not me it's not me it's not me and we just created an I Am engine we we just [ __ ] created an I Am engine it's weird how it works that way but that's what happened slow brain
[18:01] is effortful it hurts 17 time 24 oh god oh 17 let's just say 20 times 24 okay so there's four but then there's gon to be two zeros that's four z z and you're you're burning calories you're burning plasma and you're instantly thinking do
[18:17] I even need to know this why why am I doing this this is stupid where's my cell phone it's all about calories you're calculating you're conscious of how much you're calculating you're not not giving a response you're
[18:30] generating a response do you realize how important this is remember when we talked in part two about the the the Star of David RAF rfam
[18:44] rimam the uh inside your spine is you have the the the AER and efferent moving up and down up and down
[18:57] up and down and that each of those each of those neurological rivers are entities what happens when you
[19:11] feel you you are reacting you are fast braining oh that hurt oh that's that feels good oh that feels good oh that feels bad oh that
[19:23] tastes good oh that tastes bad these are instant effect e fent fast brain reptile feels reptile feels reptile feels mammal
[19:37] afference he acts he motorized all right now all of us motorize from the ID on up your ID gets to motorize First your hindbrain gets to
[19:50] motorize Second your forbrain gets to motorize third your forb brain's like this is not going to work your forbrain will do everything to manipulate the ID and the high
[20:03] brain to try and get ahead not this time but next time next time the neocortex technically only comes online when it realizes it's not in
[20:16] control it's so weird that when you lose Flow State the first thing your neocortex does is start to say I'm bored hey I'm not in charge I need to fix that and you start to punish or
[20:29] disassociate or to remove yourself from this different bureaucratic system you declare it wrong you declare it untrustful you place all the psychic bandages that you can to separate yourself from that which you feel you cannot
[20:44] control you create this relationship with yourself and all this is good this is the Triune brain baby this is this is important any Corporation would tell you this is card compartmentalization and you know who
[20:58] gets get a key to the safe just the treasurer but but all of us are a family I know and just the treasurer gets the safe key that's all but we're all a big happy yes we're all a big happy family but none of you get the key to the safe
[21:11] except for the treasurer it's just that's how our body's going to work makes sense to do it this way so as you look out in the world and you start to uh see the world and I know we've all been through this you know oh
[21:25] the world's this and blah blah blah BL you're just looking at your body you're just looking at your body even the bureaucracy when you're in the DMV you're looking at at why you can't just say I want more dopamine I want
[21:38] more dopamine I want more dopamine your brain's like your epinephrine social credit score is not good enough my friend we're going to stop your dopamine Supply and you're like you you're doing
[21:51] this to torture me you're a youth and istics B it's like all that's true all that real and all of this is exactly how you would only be able to relate to your
[22:05] entire system is that you would have to have this Triune separation from it all so I want you to know that to not know yourself is to know yourself I think that's probably at the heart of of
[22:19] of where I'm getting at here so when we look at our systems and we think about what's coming online and what's not we've got the sympathetic nervous system the parasympathetic nervous nervous system and you have these dorsal and ventral systems your ventril is the
[22:33] front of your house the front of your boat this is where you place place the the the the the lady under the ship and and she's just tits out just embracing the the sea like you know I'm completely
[22:46] vulnerable because I desire contact I'm not afraid I desire contact I'm not afraid she says as she's launched herself on the on the bow of your ship that your vental system and if she gets hit with too many seagull poops she's
[23:00] going to go underground she's going to go inside and go I'm not I'm [ __ ] you guys I'm I'm not I'm not hanging out on the front of your boat anymore and it changes the entire Vibe no one wants to they're like I don't want to sail this isn't even fun anymore so your vental
[23:13] system shuts down and your ship starts to turn itself more into a submarine why because you go into this sympathetic system and you say look we're not going to have ventral system right now it's just not going to happen and I'm reminding you of the question that that I asked you earlier
[23:28] to today I I I and and please keep writing down if you think about these things because there was a time in my life where I thought that I had an allergy a food
[23:39] allergy and ladies and gentlemen I was around someone that was shutting down my ventral system and I was not digesting why was I not digesting
[23:52] because you have to feel safe to digest and if you're not feeling safe and you're putting food in your mouth you're not going to digest it so what does it do it just inflames it's foreign
[24:03] material that's blocking your intestinal tract your intestinal tract is not open right now because it is not safe for them to be open so it shuts itself
[24:16] down so many of the allergies that we see that we encounter that we have could simply be looked at as your parasympathetic system is not open for business and there's a reason why
[24:31] someone's loitering someone's shoplifting someone's vandalizing and the person in charge you is not watching the gate it's
[24:43] not and so the other systems kick in and they have their they have the exact same access as you're about to see is what your mind does your mind tells you it's an allergy your sympathetic system says it's not safe to
[24:56] eat that's all how do I get it safe to eat you realize that cilantro and bleach have the exact same chemo signal except for like one little bit of protein is just
[25:10] slightly and the reason why many of you hate cilantro you find it disgusting you actually don't you love cilantro you love it you think it's amazing and you eat food that has it and you know you love it but when I tell you this you get mad no I hate cilantro James I hate it
[25:26] because when I cut it I hate it and you do that that because your sympathetic system says dude I don't know if we can trust this this chemo signal is so close to bleach and I don't know if I have enough
[25:40] faith in you to distinguish the difference man I don't know if you are you sure you got this and you're up there going dude it's safe I can totally I don't know if I trust you you literally reading your boogers three years ago right it's that same kind of
[25:53] relationship you have and so our allergies are This brilliant bumper car right utilizing its own AI to put on its own own uh brakes why because of our bureaucracy our sematic say it with me
[26:08] sematic bureaucracy isn't that beautiful there is a sematic bureaucracy at work and it causes these systems to come on or offline and you do not know until you in touch with your body whether or not these things even
[26:24] work it is a special thing about humans that we secrete tears when we are emotionally sad scientifically we've yet to to find another species that actually
[26:39] demonstrates tear duct secretion as an emotional response to being sad please note I didn't say that other animals do not show sadness they definitely do I'm just explaining to you that the lacrimal
[26:52] the the glands that we use in our tear ducts uh have a special use case for humans we use them for a very special case which is the expression not
[27:05] actually of sadness at first you might think oh tears are about sadness and they certainly are but tears are about something even more profound and it's called the pag and in order to get to
[27:18] the pag we have to uh follow this spinal cord and realize what this happens but before we get there I want you to understand that samples of women showed that protein
[27:32] concentrations of emotional tears was 24% higher than that of irritant induced tears so dust secretes a certain kind of tear in
[27:48] the emotional test subject I mean in the test subject but an emotional response to something that is sad also produces a tiar however the tiar
[28:02] has 24% more protein the tear has a different flavor so we cry for two reasons we certainly cry to drain our ducks to to clear out uh some sort of
[28:17] Spore that we think is attacking our system but but above all that we also utilize tears as a kind of signaling um I think a good way of looking at this

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
28:32] is that there is emotional fat that gets burnt and that emotional fact gets burnt in a huge event in some kind of large
[28:44] way um the guy Dr Fry here says he also feels that the levels of prolactin in one system provide a threshold effect affecting how easily emotional tears are shed in response to given stimul Imus
[28:59] meaning that as we look at when and how we shed our tears we're noticing that it's not just about it sad it's whenever there's a certain threshold of
[29:10] qualia is reached your pag comes online if you missed last week's episode qualia is this idea of the conscious flavor of a moment not necessarily a moment but more of the ingrams that your brain
[29:26] records about something that just happen to you the things that store themselves longer in your memory will have a a more potent qualia and as we start to understand what Consciousness really is
[29:38] we need this qualia quotient to to even analyze the potency of the brw you could grab a a beer or a bottle of wine and it will tell you the alcohol content and I'm telling you that the experience as
[29:52] it happens to your brain has a certain potency very much the same that the flavor that poten is going to determine how drunk you are by the ghosted memories of those neurons that will haunt
[30:05] you through your nostalgic uh life force right as you remember things you're retting the qualia so just to get you back to this idea of qualia so the emotional fat that
[30:18] we burn is an excess of qualia that we find a little bit too much for us it's the way that the body is able to communicate systematically like systemwide throughout the entire body that hey guys the emotional Timber of
[30:34] what we just felt is a little bit extreme over here and we're just letting you know that that's what these tears are and they're communicating not just to each other because tears do something really fascinating but we're
[30:46] communicating that to our to our body if you notice that you catch yourself crying have you noticed that it's true you catch yourself you're like what okay I'm crying oh my God you
[30:59] notice it like it's raining you catch you're not like Martha I'm going to cry now what you've just said is very disturbing here it comes in three two before I cry Martha I just want to say I really think we need to rethink what
[31:17] we're you know it doesn't doesn't work that way you notice why because a beacon has been sent out a PSA right an amber alert has been sent on your phone acly saying hey guys a
[31:29] little bit too much notice that during a an increase in prolactin levels is observed in healthy men and women following an orgasm so it's not just about oh this is too devastating it's about oh this is
[31:43] too ecstatic the Ecstasy is too much in here I'm G to cry right the sorrow is too much in here I'm going to cry now this is this is Shamu about tell you this is how the
[31:59] Orca think because you and I think that there's this this ex height that says all emotions that are above this ex are good and all the emotions that are below it
[32:10] are bad and orca is like me want all emotions me want all emotions and the laca tells you that the orc is right the laca tells you
[32:23] James the Ecstasy of the orgasm and the pain of the loss of your favorite pet or the S qualia it's the same and it's
[32:37] true the losses that I have are so monumentally meaningful to me and that the qualia that I have in them I find soulless in that qualia I find soulless in that quala and some of you do too that's why we're brothers I
[32:53] [ __ ] swear that's why we're brothers because we've seen that we've been there we I like this taste this is Savory and we've just invented a new pallet that didn't exist before it's
[33:06] like well you can't call that savory that is stringently potent no it's Savory no it's stringently potent and after a few Beyond stringently potent becomes Savory and you're eating [ __ ] tobasco sauce like a
[33:20] madman why because you've understood right you've understood this this cycle the cycle is a go so the orgasm and the tragedy are the
[33:30] are the same and that the pag is this special special spot you guys this spot is GNA blow your mind I I literally mean
[33:42] that I literally the per uh the per aqu aqueductal gray is an area the top of your brain stem it's a little triangle you'll see it here in the diagram which your gray
[33:58] matter is going to be more neurons your white matter is going to be more more uh roadways and so in the hard of your gray matter you have in the center you have this cerebral Aqueduct this period
[34:12] ductal gray it's the production of emotional tears um as we said before is uniquely present in Homo sapiens and they come from the pag that the tears that you ex Street technically are the pag climaxing that there's a part the
[34:26] central U the central inness of you itself is climaxing we cry when we're really happy or when we're really sad we cry when we're really moved think about how different those feelings are but you're still secreting
[34:40] the same lacal emotional uh red flags right guys this is really intense I know it's really intense I agree it's really intense I agree it's really intense and that's that's what tears
[34:54] look like tears are made of salt and potassium both of which are tied to memory as you know the very first time that you're able to learn a
[35:08] memory is the very first time through osmosis you're able to pull foreign water in from from your Blas assy as you're developing and that and that your brain this thoughtful water chamber is
[35:20] not even a thing it's a living liquid of water we're going to get to this when we talk about the liquid uh I swear we're going to get to that the liquid mine but but the the so the essence of who you are is built into memory and the memory
[35:34] itself is built in the salt and pottassium that are found in water and that the water themselves is the sh the very essence of shio that sacred aquafer that's deep deep underground that's
[35:46] telling you who you are who the essence of you is and you know what that sounds to me like sounds like the ID sounds like Gia's ID the entire time is this
[35:59] concept of shol and what would shol be but cranial spinal fluid all the way down at your sacrum right the deepest parts of your cave are full of water and that water never sees the light of day sounds like she old
[36:13] me the protein concentration of emotional tears is 20% greater I told you that than irid induced tears sorry for repeating myself and emotional tiar generate testosterone and estrogen when secreted publicly on a lyic network
[36:28] I I really want to send this home I so there's like oh free energy free energy free energy the saying is free
[36:39] energy free energy but when a woman cries it's a free energy device hear me out this is pretty amazing when you do the
[36:51] math my estrogen I said estrogen my estrogen goes off the [ __ ] charts when a woman cries every man in here that happens
[37:03] to when a man cries a woman's testosterone goes off the [ __ ] off the charts here's what's interesting a non-free energy advice
[37:18] would mean the momentum right we're on a train we're going to hook we're in an electric car we're going to hook a generator up to the electric car we have a free energy device we brilliant right no right because the lag you know you've
[37:32] got the drag and the the drag loses the energy well well there's no lag here because one woman cries if 60 men hear a woman cry all 60 systems all 60
[37:46] sympathetic systems secrete something if 10,000 people saw the same woman cry then 10,000 systems would secrete something we are living in a free energy
[37:59] device and it's only free energy through symbiosis this is what's so mindblowing about this concept that the concept of free energy exists only through our symbiotic nature that the fact that we are all have this reactionary think
[38:13] about what the it is living in the precipice of that reactive State and that it turns out that the free energy device that we literally find in our in in symbiosis itself is simply pointing
[38:26] back at that reactive state of that pure state of reaction reaction free energy free energy woman cries a thousand men build a bridge thousand
[38:38] men it's endless there's no limit to that so little pull I wrote here tears make eggs drop sperm grow and milk flow all of the
[38:53] secretions that we use from these tear ducts are some sort of like massive power device where we're bringing each other online either through the fear of
[39:08] Tears or through the power of knowing that you can make them either show up or go away and this is the squeezing of the pag which is why I think this pag thing
[39:21] is bigger than we think it is I think it's even bigger um um yeah I already showed you although as you go up the spine I want you to notice these look like little fingers this is an anatomically accurate
[39:36] version of the uh nervous system and these are fingers on the spine just had to point that out thought that was really cool there let me make sure miss okay good good so in order to
[39:52] explain I want to talk about L lordosis in the pag okay so lordosis is a uh proning of the
[40:06] spine and that when uh when the spine is placed in a certain pronic position to present itself that a ton of chemicals start to secrete automatically and then if
[40:23] you really want or like really desperate to pick someone up if you go to a yoga class you're probably going to find a woman that is secreting chemicals that are not her fault meaning that she's
[40:36] placed herself into a mood of sorts am I sharing my screen so you guys can see this she's placed herself in a mood of sorts I I realize men do yoga please forgive me for the generalization here but but that that the the concept of
[40:50] being in cow pose literally secretes and stimulates the pag and places your body your entire physiological body into a state of parasympathetic
[41:05] ecstasy and that just as you can hold the victory pose just as you can wear a smile and suddenly become cheerful you can put yourself in cow pose and arouse yourself and the reason why
[41:18] you're arousing yourself is because the lordosis the state that you have is stimulating the pag it's squeezing the pag the very very tip of this brain stem it's very much like petting the the head
[41:32] of your ID right think about that the top of your ID would be the top of this brain stem and that if you were to go oh it's okay little pig it's okay that that would stimulate your pag and your pag would be
[41:44] like and be would be happy at that point so this creature has its own its own uh doorway very different doorway in fact
[41:58] and you know when you going to hold a snake say a deadly venomous snake or even a snake with big teeth is not venomous you're gonna you're going to grab it right by the pag why because if
[42:11] you squeeze the pag it limits the options of the snake's limic choices and the snake decides that the best course of action for me to have in this situation is to open my
[42:26] mouth and that every second that the snake has while you gripping him by the pag the snake is going through this decision of what's the best decision I should make I should open my mouth what's the best decision I should make I should open my mouth okay what about now we should open our mouth what about now we should open
[42:41] our mouth what about now we should open our mouth you have hacked the snake you have hacked the snake by squeezing the pag and this doesn't just happen on snakes but before we go on let me read this to you dorsal pag neurons are
[42:55] activated during various defensive behaviors stimulations can provoke defensive responses characterized by freezing immobility running jumping tacac cardia you know just like speeding up your heart rate blood pressure and
[43:09] muscle tonis in contrast stimulation of the codal ventrolateral pad can result in an immobile relaxed posture known as quesence whereas its inhibitions lead to increased local motor
[43:21] activity literally telling you that the pag has two gears and if you squeeze on the front you're going to fire and if you squeeze on the back you're going to break it's like a jet
[43:38] fighter and in the middle of your legs you're holding the joystick of your it and if you place your fingers on the front of that joystick you've got a trigger and you can fire things and if you push the pag boom you bullets come
[43:51] out big [ __ ] bullets come out boom boom and if you stroke the back all the piece comes out the most relaxed thing you could ever imagine comes out it's two
[44:05] gears two gears both gears are fast brain slow brain but full on you think about it that's what you're doing for the pag you're saying I want you all
[44:19] fast and all slow at the same time and it remember the uh pose I showed you last time the sorry I can't remember the name but the the there's a pose that if there's certain things that if you press
[44:34] in certain uh pressure points that you're going to enter into this Lazarus pose that's it the Lazareth pose and that it looks like a sarcophagus almost like a a pharaoh that's been buried in sarcophagus that it that just by
[44:46] squeezing on the neck you go and and there's two ways this way then there's like this way and that these characteristics I was trying to explain to you are this this would be our Pure reflex of self and our reflex of self is
[45:01] entering into the shape of the [ __ ] ID it's literally placing itself back into the shape of the brain stem and why would it do that because it doesn't e arms and legs why does it not
[45:16] e arms and legs because it's reactive it's not aactive it's reactive right I should say proactive but I'm saying say aactive because of I
[45:28] want you to think about AER versus eer reactive versus reactive raw Ray the two concepts of sun oh my God we'll talk about that later but this this this this
[45:43] idea of a purely reactive State doesn't necessarily need the psychological negativity that we automatically place with that that a reactive state would be a symbiotic State and it's difficult to
[45:57] really distinguish the difference between these two things when you really really Place yourself in the moment remove all the victimhood saying I shouldn't be here or this doesn't happen or this shouldn't be happening or something's not right or and you realize no this is
[46:11] just this is what the needle feels this is what the needle feels all the time and it never wants anything else that's the ID 2 plus
[46:24] two 2 plus two so it's even easier than you think the pag has buttons it's got buttons people there are literal buttons
[46:40] inside that pack that you can stimulate with electrodes and you can pull out a reaction now the the I know you guys don't believe me anymore I don't blame you but you used to believe me when I said I have a new book coming out and
[46:56] that and and the the the the the poel the the not the prequel but the sequel uh to Quantum Rapture deals with this pag device because when you do the math on
[47:09] this thing you are looking at a collar a neurological collar that can be placed inside the
[47:21] brain and literally pull any kind of emotional response you want want out of that physiology there are tumors there are paralysis patients that have been tested
[47:38] on where the pag has been stimulated in various ways and the patient will just start laughing hysterically or start crying or uncontrollably or grow emotionally the
[47:52] most angry hate-filled person you can imagine like in a second and I want you to know this because I want you to take a moment to
[48:07] disengage from the association you have with your feelings being who you are because when you start to understand the pag from this perspective that I'm telling you
[48:22] about you're looking at a world where it would be very easy for you to have some sort of PAG stimulus device on you right
[48:33] now and that you would never know it was there I don't mean this in a paranoid way I mean this in a Gaia God way I mean this in a much more profound way than just
[48:49] paranoia that there is a process there is an override that is even inside of you that you can be hacked just like every other thing that you hack yourself you hack
[49:02] squirrels we hack cows all the time we turn them into stake because we hack them we hack them we can convince them to go from point A to point B the entire time we're hacking the entire
[49:15] environment is one big gigantic hack gardening hack right making kids hack building a business hack you're hacking the
[49:29] environment the reactive state is almost like a prime motivator for you to develop hacking skills it's almost like the Reon deetra
[49:43] as as they say to why you're actually here if you don't believe me I want you to look at this kitten because this kitten had its its
[50:01] hag its pag hacked that when you grab a kitten by the hind quarters like or by the by the oh God what's it called all right you guys know what I'm talking about when you buy by that that
[50:16] thing Scruff SC nape of it's the nape of the neck I believe thank you when you grab him by the nape you're actually uh stimulating the pack believe it or not you're entering into an involuntary reflex much like the much like the Lazarus reflex I was discussing earlier
[50:31] where the body just goes into a state of submission why because it's the kitten's hacked the kitten got hacked by its mom and you can be hacked too in the same way um lesions on the codal
[50:45] ventrolateral pag can greatly reduce conditional freezing whereas lesions of dorsal aspects can reduce inate defensive Behavior virtually taming the animal simply by stimulating the pack when I see stimulating I do not mean
[50:58] like massive surgery I literally mean a tiny electrode just oh my God I'm pissed or oh my God I'm horny and so you could picture a one of the reasons why I think we're we're pretty safe when it comes to like a
[51:13] prison planet is because we're not all wearing pack Tacs like th th this would be so easy I'm not making this up this would be so easy and I I think you're looking at the future of Mecha suits right you know I know RoboCop really set
[51:28] us back because everyone's like oh I don't want to be a Robocop but the the story of Robocop the idea of paralytic patients being able to walk again is a reality and it will be a reality because of the pag it will be because of the
[51:40] pag because the pag has the ability to open up oh [ __ ] no one has a carburetor anymore but it's it's the idea that you could open the hood of a car and you could you could rev the engine from the car simply by pulling the
[51:53] switch that you could kill the engine simply by closing the butterfly Bel that there are certain ways to operate the vehicle without actually being behind the driver's seat and that those ways actually are a lot more efficient actually they're even more convenient
[52:07] than you could ever imagine and then those systems give you an even better clue of what else is out there of what what what actually is going on and and I don't know I don't I don't think we do
[52:18] know I only know how easily I am hackable that's what I know and I know that through my pack at any point in time I think an enti could walk in this room and literally just pause me and I'd just be paused and that whatever could
[52:33] happen during the pause and then I could be unpaused some of you might be why are you talking about this it's okay I think this is fun but uh but seriously when you understand that that's how hackable you are I just think it becomes easier
[52:43] to disassociate from that raw feed feed of who you are and REM and return yourself to the awareness behind the reaction the awareness behind the reaction
[52:57] is a a stronger ground for identity out of there inqua so when we think about everything that we've been talking about the Triune brain this idea that you have a bios and
[53:10] that built on top of the BIOS is the operating system right and built on top of the operating system you actually run the application itself that I just described to you the trium brain these three separate systems uh quasi feel like too you can't even really talk to
[53:25] the ID necessar neily because it's not going to talk back it's just simply reacting so you can't even distinguish which would be its words but then after you see this Triune brain we start to understand how much of a slave in in a good way I think we are
[53:39] to the manners of group regulation that no matter what there's going to be a chemical equation that's going to have to satisfy and all of us know that the satisfaction is going to require all of us to give and take some sort of chemical reaction to whatever is presented to us in the room and that we
[53:53] just naturally do that it's called getting long or not not getting along it's just chemistry and that the reptile processor is a very simple thing it's so simple that we understand how simple it is we understand it has a very simple code
[54:07] that code is a is there something novel is there something different in the room B is that thing that is different that is novel is it a threat see if it is not a threat it is food and those three steps that I just told you about I just
[54:22] built aniant visible invisible world that the reptile will never see because those three rules give it blind spots that the reptile will never be aware of is that novel is a blind spot why
[54:34] because the reptile is only going only going to focus and spend calories on what is novel which means a predator simply has to not satisfy the quotient of what considers novel in a reptile
[54:49] brain and what would be considered novel really is going to come down to how many seconds can that reptile keep his phonological Loop running in his head what does that sound like the reptile's like there's a creature that has a spot that's in the center of its head but
[55:04] slightly placed to the left and there's another spot that's centrally placed in its head but to the right and I think that that could be a living [Music] entity okay what are we doing what are we doing like that it's
[55:18] gone it's gone and you know what made it gone is because that thing didn't move if that Central spot that was slightly to the left and had another Central spot that was slightly to the right and that that thing suddenly didn't move for a long enough time the reptile would
[55:32] simply not see it anymore why because it's not novel you're the same way I don't mean it's as simple as what's novel I'm telling you that you and I probably only
[55:45] see raw's light because it's novel it probably works in that same kind of profound way that there's a deeper dimension of this world I'm going to use the word echolocation to prove

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
55:58] this to you that there is a giant dimension of information that is right the [ __ ] here and that because remember we we turned off our old factory gland from the moment you're born you shut off the old factory in the top of your mouth
[56:12] you shut that off you have no echolocation so I just proved to you that there are two Dimensions that you literally do not see and it's all around us right now and it's dictating most of our Behavior so you have a better place at
[56:26] better sense of who and where you are and how all this fits and you understand the importance of the low calorie brain now I want you to start finding the
[56:41] practicality of all this stuff I'm telling you I want you to start to understand that the things that I'm telling you aren't just interesting and I hope you find them interesting but they are uh
[56:54] applicably uh practical in in the field and that the first step that you will find them to be applic applicably practical in the field is just simply noticing reptile noticing noticing noticing noticing noticing noticing
[57:09] noticing and the first way you're going to notice the reptile is to know who who the reptile is not you start to look deeper at this idea that a reptile tells no lies the neocortex that's all it does as lie you're going to find it's more
[57:23] difficult to even see your ID if you're too busy insisting that you don't lie too right so the first step to notice that you lie is to notice that your it does not lie and you start to see yourself instantly in those moments and you can start to build a new compassion
[57:38] literally you're building a new compassion energy for your ID something you've never had before because you insisted that you're one person I'm I'm one thing I'm not a a fist inside of a past inside of a future what the [ __ ]
[57:52] are you talking about James I'm one thing right and that's a great Simplex way to be that's an objective reality way to live there's nothing wrong with that you can go do that right but you're going to be like Republican Democrat NFL AFL whatever right it's it's very
[58:05] Simplex there's more to this and a reptile tells no lies because profoundly we do so let's begin let's begin with the practicum quiz
[58:20] time please think about this if you had to choose between abandoning someone or being abandoned which would you choose think about relationship think
[58:36] about really special person you you're really fond of and I know it's it's rough but for whatever reason in this thought exercise either you're going to have to dump them
[58:50] or they are going to have to dump you okay your first reaction to this isn't necessarily going to be your reptile because I don't think enough of us are even in touch with our reptile to even
[59:06] notice what our first reaction is I think most of us have a fashion about what we like for our first reaction to be right so we're kind of like well my first reaction is to think about the children oh you know and like stuff like
[59:20] that it's like well that's great so I don't even know how well you can even trust getting to know this first reaction ction part part of who you are and I I don't think there's a right answer by the way I think that the
[59:34] answer is more an exercise to see that there are two sides of you I'm going to just suggest to you that the reptile would say well I want to I want to dump that person I want to be the person that breaks up with them I don't want to have
[59:49] all that heartache I want to walk around feeling all lonely and like rejected I'm a reptile I'm cold so blooded I ain't got time for that I ain't got no time for that you know so I want to be the one that breaks up this is an easy why you
[01:00:02] even ask me this of course I want to be the person that breaks up this is the easiest decision you've ever asked me says the reptile the mammal the mammal's got something to
[01:00:17] think about because the mammal's like oh man yeah being dumb sucks like it really does but you know when I get
[01:00:27] Dums and I am eating [ __ ] ice cream I am binging on trailer bug boys I am wearing the same underwear for like six weeks you know like I'm just I'm
[01:00:40] completely in this state of I'm a victim I deserve sympathy and I deserve tenderness and everyone around me is going to give me that
[01:00:54] and the that did this to me oh it's going to hurt so bad it's gon to hurt and the mammal starts to think about well what is it going to be like to be the person that dumps what what what are
[01:01:09] the implication what is what's my future GNA be right and it's going to be a lot of I can't believe what you did to Linda you're piece of [ __ ] it's a lot of that right it's a lot of that you're just
[01:01:21] like guys man Linda's such a Mania I don't [ __ ] she's a good heart she's a good person you know and and you're you're feeling that and I I'll tell
[01:01:35] you I've been in relationships and I've The Compassion that I've felt even if it's a fantasy because I know I'm not all that but the fantasy that I had about how painful it was going to be for me to dump this person was enough that I
[01:01:51] would not leave the relationship at certain times I didn't want that pain I didn't want to be responsible for hurting someone I cared about this person right cared about
[01:02:04] them and so I can tell you from this Vista I'm not saying this is how I feel across the board and I think it kind of paints me as this oh what a nice guy I'm not even trying to tell you that I'm trying to tell you that this is a way that your reptile and your mammal have
[01:02:18] this parlay and they meet on this [ __ ] Island and they exchange weird pleasantries for this moment because for this moment you really get to see both sides you get to see what the grass is actually like on the other
[01:02:32] side because the mamalon me would so much rather be dumped it's so much better it reinforces my own self-doubts reinforces my own
[01:02:43] rejections it's a good place to be it's a good place to be and that is weird that is [ __ ] weird what I just said it's weird because in the pre- aquarium day there was a time when no
[01:02:58] one would have thought that way I it might be hard for you to picture that way now well but I swear to you if you're old enough you'll there's a time when really no one would feel that way no one would be like hey that's the way
[01:03:11] it goes it's that's most of the greasers most of grease lightning is about the other way it's it's yes we have heartache but this concept of success and and and what we consider the lack of
[01:03:24] failure is this lack of rejection and the lack of rejection is seen very much like what I mean by if it's above the curve it's positive but if it's not we're not going to be calling this Savory this is bad this is not Savory
[01:03:38] it's that kind of debate so there are two answers you have a reptile answer and you have a mammal answer but only the mammal knows this this is what's so hard about this only the mammal knows second
[01:03:52] question a little bit harder when you ride a bike which direction is easier is it easier to ride a bike uphill or is it easier to ride a bike downhill this is a hard
[01:04:10] question I say it's hard because first of all it's like oh duh riding downhill is so much easier than riding uphill very true it's not even a trick question it's like a legit answer and the reptile would be right he'd get a gold star and
[01:04:24] he'd win every time and here's what happens this is what I was talking about earlier here's what happens every time the reptile goes out he's going to say well which direction which is easier well going downhill is easier so every single time the reptile is going to go
[01:04:39] downhill which means every single time that the reptile goes or does anything he's forcing himself to have to ride uphill on his way home he's forcing it there no choice no
[01:04:52] choice at all the mammal the m looks at which would I rather do first would I rather go uphill first and ride my bike home downhill or would I
[01:05:06] rather ride my bike downhill and go uphill this so sometimes I think something's profound and no one else in the world does I'm okay with that but I noticed that when you super rich and you live on top of the mountain and no one lives
[01:05:19] above you your life is [ __ ] because in order for you to do everything you have no choice to go downhill first every single thing you do is downhill first downhill first downhill first which means the moment you leave your bed if
[01:05:32] you're a super rich person you have to lose altitude to even engage the world and if you think about that as like a the pronic essence of what that means that's [ __ ] up if anything if you had all the money in the world you
[01:05:47] would want to live in a place where you could go uphill or downhill right but we call it a luxury we call it a luxury because because the reptile says downhill easier no such thing as as
[01:06:00] have to come back later that does not exist does not exist and you can live your entire life like a reptile you know that because you're surrounded by people that do that you're surrounded by people
[01:06:13] the truth is is that the fast brain never gets to come to a crossroad where they even have a decision think about it in the
[01:06:24] morning reptile says downhill easy there's no decision afternoon me want to get home we have to go uphill no decision
[01:06:38] ID no decisions mamal decisions you and I have created decisions out of nothing and the decisions that we
[01:06:54] created we made because we invented something called the past and we invented something called the future and the only things that prove that those two things are viable is the
[01:07:08] decisions that we invented to link the two together like that's it it's this is how creative we are we are so profoundly creative that we don't
[01:07:21] even know how creative we are it's it's [ __ ] brilliant how [ __ ] it's brilliant and [ __ ] at the same time third question third question you want to be a narcissist or
[01:07:37] you want to be an empath which would you rather be this is hard it's hard because I I would have just been die hard while impath are you [ __ ] nuts are you are you
[01:07:57] insane are you [ __ ] insane are you nuts of course impath of course James this is hands down this is the stupidest question I've ever heard you ask who in the world would want to be a
[01:08:11] narc right who in the world but let's think about that the people that call me narc typically have dehumanized me and they
[01:08:23] have zero zero zero empathy or Compassion or any kind of love or respect for me at all because I'm a narc
[01:08:35] I'm a narcissist I'm someone that is both super sensitive but also has no feelings at exactly the same time it's profound how this works I'm someone that deserves no empathy at all from anyone
[01:08:51] around them who in the [ __ ] would want to be that and I would you know why because the narc is the one that has the same role as the person who gets
[01:09:09] dumped the narc is the one that takes all the arrows the narc is the scapegoat it's like the opposite of what we think first time someone called me I
[01:09:30] was the empath in me could not accept it and the more that that label came the more I realized how problematic being empath was that how little room empath has to
[01:09:45] compassionate anyone because they are the empath they're the ones that feel more than anyone else they're the ones that their emotions way more than anyone else it's the NC's emotions that are super light
[01:10:00] superficial or meaningless that have no bearing whatso all the empath is the center of the world but it's the narc that we accuse of being this
[01:10:14] way I don't think a lot of you are even at the same place where I am I don't think I'm right but I'd rather be a narc right now in my life simply because the
[01:10:27] persecution would make me more compassionate the same way you insisting that I was an impath would make me less I would lose my Sonar if I believed
[01:10:40] I was an impath I would gain my Sonar if I believed people were suspicious that I was a narc the first thing I would do is I need to [ __ ] up my Sonar game it's the first thing I'd do
[01:10:55] but if you tell me an impath the first thing I I do is I don't need to listen so much to my Sonar I don't [ __ ] need to do that I think I'm over listening I think I'm overco compassionating my therapist says that I compassionate
[01:11:09] other people way too much is this something that a narc would say or an impath would say does anyone see the harlequinn in the room because it's right there it's
[01:11:22] [ __ ] right there right the Orca is black and white the pag will make you cry like a [ __ ] and scream in ecstasy this the same [ __ ]
[01:11:36] thing it's the same thing so all these concepts are just sign waves the thinking brain shows how one choosing to be a victim gives them a sense of power versus their power being
[01:11:50] challenged or possibly lost when you find yourself in the pit or in or in the pendulum right on the pedestal I'm sorry or you're in the
[01:12:02] pedestal or on the pit both of these are maneuvering techniques for your Chemistry to express something about yourself whether that be I need to stop
[01:12:15] being so compassionate to others or I need to be more independent because the empath in in order to be less empathic needs to be more
[01:12:28] narcissistic and the narc to be less narcissistic needs to be more empathic these two are beautiful beautiful things they go together
[01:12:42] right like chocolate and peanut butter have you noticed that there is something called reptilian diplomatic community I bring this up now in relation to what we're talking about because uh am I sharing my screen no I'm
[01:12:59] not because um because I think that we understand this nness about us even more than we think we do and I've got you on the screen here just five little vignettes
[01:13:11] of people that have uh proved uh found their way out of court through an innocence uh plea purely by appealing to the jury's belief belie that a reptilian is
[01:13:27] innocent and why do we think a reptilian has diplomatic immunity because the reptilian is just purely reacting to the situation so Virginia jury declared Lorena bobbit temporarily insane after she chopped off
[01:13:40] her husband's penis Lorena bobbit did not just chop off Mr bobbit's Penis she was operating a motor vehicle at 70 miles an hour and threw that penis out the window
[01:13:55] and all of these the court said were fast brain and I I'm not here to argue I I in fact I think Lorena Bob is kind of like a wayo ston before wayo seon was born
[01:14:07] but the the concept of where our culture sees these things I think is more telling than we think j a jury determined that John deont was mentally ill but convicted him anyway this is uh
[01:14:20] uh he shot uh who shot crap I cannot see it but um he shot somebody and uh uh but they the C temporarily insane I think you guys can read this if you want I just have it on
[01:14:35] a really small monitor uh Chicago doctor was found not guilty by reason of insanity after he killed his wife and daughter uh John hinley Jr of course killed President Ronald Reagan he was uh let off uh with his temporary insanity
[01:14:49] plea in fact a lot of the laws changed because of that uh this been happening long long time there's a this dude from history Daniel mcnut provides groundwork America's insan defense I think it was
[01:15:02] hinley uh he shot this uh uh not Hinkley the it doesn't matter you can see it there the uh um the point is is that these this reptilian laws that we have
[01:15:18] the concept that we know that there's an ID that operates and we can't convict the ID is fascinating even more fascinating I want to remind you of this of this fact we we've gone over a few times so sorry we're repeating it but like 25% of the people
[01:15:32] that are on death row have some sort of neocortex brain injury and so you're looking at the exact same kind of uh kind of stuff that that we're talking about now where um certain parts of the brain are not even
[01:15:46] online yet till you're 27 but we're convicting 22 year olds of having pure volition enough to go kill someone or kill someone else for that matter and it's just a really really sticky situation that we
[01:15:58] have um with that I cannot wait to get into body language with you guys because understanding the ID the reptile the mammal is so crucial when you start to look at at what body
[01:16:13] language is and we we're out of time for tonight which is which is fine well I I'm looking forward to talking about this next time because honestly there's there's a lot more we can discuss with this and and I wanted to see if there's 's any discussion about about finding
[01:16:27] our own reptile but I at least want you to hear this that sincerity will always come first out of the body the body will always come with honesty first it will always say exactly the honest truth first and that the next thing that
[01:16:40] happens is the Neo cortex runs as fast as it can to stop it the reptile moves before its man can speak and with that said I want you to consider that the face itself is kind of
[01:16:52] the best the best drum to see this you're looking at the average touches that happen on a human's face you'll notice that the uh hair is touched an average of four times an hour the eyes three times per hour ears one time per
[01:17:07] hour three times per hour for the nose cheeks four mouth four chin four neck one but what I find more interesting is the amount of time the average duration that someone does touch this area and
[01:17:21] that the neck and the chin will tend to be held longer and the mouth and the nose is next and as you move up the face we we tend to hold ourselves in those places for less
[01:17:33] amount of time and keep in mind that our old factory is shut off so I think the longer idea that we cover our mouth and my NOS is somehow related to that that the Securities that we express through the
[01:17:46] use of our body language is such a more thorough form of communication I've talked about this idea of beholding each other before where language just stops us from
[01:18:02] understanding the body language between us because we're distracted by the words but that you can get into a state of beholding someone and that Jesus pose where Jesus is kind of his arms are kind of opened and Mary has it too and
[01:18:16] they're just kind of like H behold you is really the essence of this eternal language it's this language of speaking through the body from the body to the body and there's not actually a communicator excuse me there's not
[01:18:29] actually one person speaking both people are beholding each other and it's hard when you're beholding someone to even understand who brought up what idea which idea came from who and if you practice this with
[01:18:43] your friends which I highly encourage you to do you'll notice these kinds of things that there's really no ownership anymore that you're not really sure who is moving the Ouija board on the communication and it's fascinating
[01:18:57] because it really does hit on this deeper truer nature um of what we are so next time we're going to be going over the different facial gestures but more importantly uh some of the intrinsic weirdness about these where they're
[01:19:11] giving us clues about how parts of the face is showing you the reptile response but the other part of the face is showing the mammal response and why that is so unique in certain types of emotional responses and how that relates

[ARTICLE STYLE / FRAMEWORK]:
Toulmin Model writing framework: firstly establish a claim, then support it with evidence (grounds), and finally build a logical and persuasive case through warrants, which connect the evidence to the claim.

[ARTICLE SHOULD BE ABOUT]:
- **Book Reference:** The speaker refers to a book called "Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow" which explores the concept of two different brain systems: fast brain and slow brain.
- **Two Brain Systems:** The speaker discusses the concept of two brain systems within individuals, referred to as fast brain and slow brain.
- **Reptile Brain:** The fast brain is likened to the reptile brain or motor brain, emphasizing its instinctual and automatic nature.
- **Wisdom of the Cerebellum:** The cerebellum is highlighted as the base of the brain containing wisdom accumulated over time.
- **Fast Brain Responses:** Fast brain responses are characterized by automatic, stereotypical, and unconscious reactions, such as the simple calculation of 2 + 2 = 4.
- **Reflexes vs. Free Will:** Reflexes are portrayed as not a loss of free will but rather the perfection of decision-making.
- **Triune Brain:** The speaker discusses the triune brain concept, which includes the reptilian brain, mammalian brain, and neocortex.
- **Symbiosis and Destiny:** There's an exploration of the symbiotic relationship between different brain systems and how it relates to one's destiny.
- **Differences in Brain Systems:** The differences between fast brain and slow brain systems are highlighted, including their functions and responses to stimuli.
- **Facial Expressions:** Facial expressions are discussed as manifestations of fast brain responses, indicating immediate reactions before conscious thought.
- **Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Systems:** The speaker discusses the roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, particularly in relation to digestion and allergies.
- **Tears as Signaling:** Tears are presented as having a signaling function, with emotional tears containing a higher protein concentration than tears induced by irritants.

This analysis provides insights into the functioning of different brain systems, their roles in decision-making and behavior, and their impact on emotional responses and bodily functions.

- Emotional tears are shed not only in response to sadness but also when a certain threshold of "qualia" is reached, which refers to the conscious flavor or intensity of a moment.
- Dr. Fry suggests that prolactin levels affect how easily emotional tears are shed, with higher levels making it easier to cry in response to various stimuli.
- Emotional tears are produced by the "periaqueductal gray" (PAG), a region at the top of the brain stem, which is unique to humans.
- PAG stimulation can evoke various emotional responses, including laughter, crying, or heightened emotional states.
- Tears contain salt and potassium, which are tied to memory formation.
- Emotional tears can generate testosterone and estrogen when secreted, affecting both the person crying and those around them.
- The PAG acts like a neurological collar, capable of eliciting emotional responses and potentially being manipulated through stimulation.
- Squeezing the PAG can alter an organism's behavior, making it more docile or defensive.
- The concept of the Triune Brain suggests that humans have three separate systems: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, which interact to regulate emotions and behaviors.
- The reptilian brain, focused on survival, responds to novelty and potential threats but has blind spots that can be exploited.
- The speaker hints at the potential manipulation of human behavior through understanding and stimulating the PAG, suggesting implications for control and identity.

- The speaker discusses the importance of understanding the reptilian brain and its influence on behavior.
- They emphasize the significance of the olfactory system and its role in echolocation, suggesting that humans have shut off this ability since birth.
- Two dimensions are highlighted: one related to echolocation, and another regarding the reptilian brain's influence on behavior.
- The practical implications of understanding these concepts are emphasized, urging listeners to apply them in their lives.
- A quiz is presented, asking listeners to consider whether they would choose to abandon someone or be abandoned, highlighting the different responses of the reptilian brain and the mammalian brain.
- The ease of riding a bike uphill versus downhill is discussed, highlighting the reptilian brain's tendency to always choose the easier option, even if it leads to difficulties later.
- The speaker presents a thought experiment about whether one would rather be a narcissist or an empath, exploring the societal perceptions and personal implications of each.
- The concept of reptilian diplomatic immunity is introduced, showcasing how certain individuals have used the reptilian brain as a defense in legal cases.
- The discussion transitions to body language and its connection to the reptilian and mammalian brains, suggesting that sincerity is expressed through the body before the neocortex interferes with communication.
- Specific patterns of facial touching are mentioned, indicating potential insights into the reptilian and mammalian responses in social interactions.
- The speaker encourages practicing "beholding" with friends to understand the deeper, non-verbal aspects of communication and the interplay between the reptilian and mammalian brains.

**ChatGPT:**
<h2>Chapter 1. Understanding the Two Brain Systems</h2><h3>1.1. Introduction to the Two Brain Systems</h3><p>In the realm of neuroscience, the concept of two distinct brain systems has garnered significant attention. Coined as the fast brain and slow brain, this dichotomy delves into the intricacies of human decision-making and behavior. One seminal work that explores this phenomenon is "Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow" by Daniel Kahneman, which serves as a cornerstone in understanding the dual nature of cognitive processes.</p><h3>1.2. The Reptile Brain: Fast Brain's Instinctual Nature</h3><p>At the core of the fast brain lies its resemblance to the primal reptilian brain, characterized by its instinctual and automatic responses. This aspect of the brain governs swift reactions, often bypassing conscious thought in favor of expediency. Such automaticity profoundly influences decision-making and behavioral patterns, shaping our responses to various stimuli.</p><h3>1.3. The Wisdom of the Cerebellum</h3><p>Contrary to the fast brain's impulsive nature, the cerebellum stands as the repository of accumulated wisdom over time. Nestled at the base of the brain, it plays a pivotal role in integrating sensory information and coordinating motor responses. The connection between the cerebellum and the fast brain underscores the complexity of neural mechanisms underlying human cognition and action.</p><h2>Chapter 2. Characteristics of Fast Brain Responses</h2><h3>2.1. Automatic and Stereotypical Reactions</h3><p>Fast brain responses are characterized by their automatic and stereotypical nature, operating at a subconscious level to facilitate rapid decision-making. This innate tendency to bypass conscious deliberation enables swift reactions to familiar stimuli, streamlining cognitive processes for efficiency.</p><h3>2.2. Reflexes vs. Free Will</h3><p>It's essential to distinguish reflexes as manifestations of the fast brain's efficiency rather than impediments to free will. Far from limiting autonomy, reflexes exemplify the culmination of perfected decision-making honed through evolution. They serve as adaptive mechanisms geared towards survival and optimization of behavioral outcomes.</p><h2>Chapter 3. The Triune Brain Concept</h2><h3>3.1. Introduction to the Triune Brain</h3><p>The triune brain concept offers a comprehensive framework encompassing the reptilian brain, mammalian brain, and neocortex. Each component plays a distinct role in regulating cognitive functions, emotions, and higher-order thinking processes. Understanding this tripartite structure provides valuable insights into the complexities of human behavior.</p><h3>3.2. Symbiosis and Destiny</h3><p>The symbiotic relationship between different brain systems underscores their collective influence on shaping one's destiny. Interactions between the reptilian brain, mammalian brain, and neocortex synergistically mold behavioral patterns and decision-making tendencies. This intricate interplay highlights the interconnectivity of neural networks in orchestrating human cognition.</p><h2>Chapter 4. The Role of Facial Expressions</h2><h3>4.1. Manifestation of Fast Brain Responses</h3><p>Facial expressions serve as tangible manifestations of fast brain responses, offering glimpses into underlying emotional states before conscious thought intervenes. These nonverbal cues convey a wealth of information, facilitating interpersonal communication and social interaction.</p><h3>4.2. Insights into Emotional Responses</h3><p>Exploring the significance of facial expressions unveils profound insights into emotional responses and internal states. By decoding these cues, individuals can better navigate social dynamics and empathetically engage with others. The integration of facial expressions into daily interactions underscores their pivotal role in fostering emotional intelligence.</p><h2>Chapter 5. Understanding the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Systems</h2><h3>5.1. Roles of the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems</h3><p>The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems play crucial roles in regulating bodily functions and emotional responses. While the sympathetic system triggers the body's fight-or-flight response, the parasympathetic system promotes relaxation and homeostasis, illustrating a delicate balance between arousal and calmness.</p><h3>5.2. Impact on Emotional Responses</h3><p>Examining the influence of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems on emotional responses reveals their profound effects on digestion and allergic reactions. These physiological manifestations underscore the intricate link between neural processes and emotional experiences, emphasizing the interconnectedness of mind and body.</p><h2>Chapter 6. Tears as Signaling: Emotional Responses Explored</h2><h3>6.1. Significance of Emotional Tears</h3><p>Emotional tears serve as poignant signals of heightened emotional states, distinguished by their higher protein concentrations compared to tears induced by irritants. This biochemical distinction underscores the physiological basis of emotional expression, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of human emotions.</p><h3>6.2. Neurological Basis of Emotional Tears</h3><p>The production of emotional tears by the periaqueductal gray (PAG) region of the brain elucidates the neurological underpinnings of emotional responses. By modulating hormone levels and eliciting emotional states, emotional tears serve as tangible manifestations of internal emotional processes, bridging the gap between cognition and affect.</p><h2>Chapter 7. Conclusion: Implications and Applications</h2><h3>7.1. Practical Implications of Understanding Brain Systems</h3><p>Understanding the interplay between fast and slow brain systems holds profound implications for decision-making, communication, and personal development. By leveraging this knowledge, individuals can optimize cognitive processes and enhance emotional intelligence, fostering holistic well-being and adaptive behavior.</p><h3>7.2. Application in Daily Life</h3><p>The application of insights gleaned from brain system dynamics extends beyond theoretical understanding to practical implementation in daily life. From interpersonal communication to self-regulation, integrating this knowledge empowers individuals to navigate complex social landscapes and cultivate resilience in the face of adversity.</p><h3>7.3. Future Directions and Research</h3><p>As our understanding of brain systems continues to evolve, future research endeavors hold promise for uncovering novel insights into human cognition and behavior. By exploring uncharted territories and pushing the boundaries of scientific inquiry, researchers can illuminate the complexities of the mind and unlock new frontiers in neuroscience.</p>
