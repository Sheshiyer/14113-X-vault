[00:00] okay so let us start this session because of uh few reasons we could not had the invited speech in the morning so
[00:12] instead now we are going to have it uh it's really my honor and privilege to introduce Professor kutumba shastri G
[00:25] who is an udite scholar of ad vanta as Poetics and Sanskrit literature so you see the two extreme
[00:39] branches on the one hand ad vant and dasana and on the other hand Poetics and Sanskrit literature he was the director of rria Sanskrit sstan and he took
[00:53] initiatives to make it a deemed University and uh now we know it is a Central [Music] University this is
[01:14] good this is all okay so [Music] um after the rash Sanskrit sstan became
[01:28] uh deemed University he was the first vice Chancellor of that University and after that he was a vice Chancellor of sananda
[01:40] University and also somat srit University at ver in Gujarat good that will be better let see what it is notes will also come
[02:02] remove the that what is that mobile hard dis okay you want both the views [Music] how to go
[02:46] next Arrow okay good only arrow okay so just give me one more minute uh I know the it's getting late but uh some
[03:03] of the things about our uh invited speaker Professor Kuma shastri I should tell one important thing is he got uh he was award he had several Awards one of
[03:18] the awards is the president award which he got from uh PR mukarji our rraa G and another award was
[03:30] uh he got a infosis he was awarded infosis chair at bandar Oriental Research Institute for 2 years and
[03:39] during which he worked on very uh important topic which is uh important from the point of view of discourse analysis and that is the TPA how to what
[03:55] is TPA uh and he looked at uh various interpretations various um uh manuscripts and based on that he has uh
[04:08] his book will now come out in um soon from bakar Oriental Research Institute on the tatparya and uh today he is going to speak on that uh but he didn't stop
[04:22] after that uh after retirement he has he is very busy uh especially with this work on uh the TPA at bori and a after
[04:35] completing this work he has now ventured into another one U he got another fellowship from icpr and he's again working on a very important work on U
[04:49] the adikas and uh again a very uh difficult text to understand and there are very few few Scholars who can work on such
[05:02] text and we are very fortunate to have uh Professor kutuma shastri G here to uh tell us about what is there in Indian in our Indian shastras and now I think is
[05:15] the time to know for all of us to uh to know about the discourse analysis and how we decide how uh one adhikar or one text is related to another text or one
[05:31] paragraph is related to another paragraph what are the parameters and we would like to hear these things from you thank you for accepting our invitation thank
[05:57] [Music] you
[06:00] [Music] I think I am audible
[06:28] okay at the outset I express my deep sense of gratitude to the organizers of 7th conference International Conference
[06:41] of samrit computational linguistics which is very pioneering and a very new area of developing area of research
[06:52] especially to Professor am Kar mam who was always kind enough with me and also uh earlier also I
[07:09] spoke once twice from the platform provided by her in Hyderabad and other places today tya means in nutshell there is one
[07:25] crisp Sams sentence G there are good number of Sanskrit students here and Scholars here who can enjoy this now what is the meaning of it sun has set that's all nothing else but
[07:40] it gives okay okay okay so it gives different meanings for different people for a brahmachari it
[07:57] means that it is now time for performing s for a cow her it means that now I must make my Harden returning its home
[08:12] for similarly there is a very there are 10 15 meanings are provided in Kya prasha itself and now I don't have time to dwell on that this because this is what is said so many components
[08:36] are when we come to the question of T and V I ever since I missed first timei I was repeatedly telling this at
[08:48] that time sometimes machine capabilities must be immensely more uh I don't say impossible but human
[08:58] computer is par Excellence so in anyway I did some work on TPA four questions I addressed what is TPA according to various others text based study only
[09:14] because we are incapable of going outside the text we are only just like parrots whatever is there in the text we will only tell that not going much Beyond it except here and there some
[09:26] touches be given secondly what is TPA where is TPA is needed why TPA should be accepted and how to know the TPA this
[09:44] how to know TPA is very vast field with which I think we are more concerned uh and in that I'm doing today a small presentation let us see let me read as intru
[09:59] ction vas are the most ancient and largest groups of books vas groups of books is not right because we consider Veda is
[10:12] only one it is VAV Vasa who divided it into four so according to Indian tradition vaa is only one so its size is you can imagine but anyway taking the uh
[10:27] nowadays popular View largest groups of books held to be impersonal by the faithful in India impersonal AA with no or human origination they contain hundreds and
[10:42] hundreds of chapters thousands and thousands of passages and sentences no exaggeration even thousand may be a small word there sentences number may be
[10:54] in lacks also they carry ideas mutually comp compliment sometimes and sometimes mutually contradictory too hundreds and hundreds of rituals are mentioned and
[11:09] described in these texts the language is evidently very old and aric because date of we any is anywhere between 6,000 BC to 10,000
[11:22] BCE therefore a great question arose as to how to explain the keeping consistency in mind several attempts have been made to address this problem from time
[11:40] immemorial content wise the vas are content wise The Vedas are mainly concerned with two things rituals and philosophy therefore Indian shastra
[11:54] Karas addressed themselves with the greater need of evolving a consistent Theory and system through which the form of the rituals can be constructed with
[12:05] all the details required by a performer do a huge system came into existence through sage jman in the name of Pur IMA and continues still giving possible
[12:18] solutions to textual and hermeneutical problems this has resulted in evolving around 1,000 principles of laws or nia this is of
[12:38] sh is of two types one is and the other one is narma the first one is rituals the second one is
[12:53] philosophy similarly another system came into existence through S baday yasa to evolve a spiritual and philosophical Theory through reconciling various
[13:05] seemingly conflicting statements to fall in line with each other or with the central teaching of the texts in the name of sh this system added around 191
[13:19] principles laws or Nas or principles of discourse as figured out through am Madam thus a huge system came into the existence to interpret the
[13:37] vi okay thus the Indian hermeneutical tradition herotic is the right word or not I doubt it our term
[13:53] isak is coined by Shankar BH in one of the adikas he says or something thus the Indian hermeneutical tradition is as old as and as vast as
[14:13] the vas we will share a few thoughts on a basic set of six principles which have been widely used by both the MIM sakas and the vedantins they are invented by
[14:25] the MIM sakas as the case is mostly so with regard to the Indian hermeneutics and elaborately discussed in the third ad of the shashia which is also called
[14:40] Anga according to Kumar laat these are foundational in purum mimamsa these six principles are very foundational in purum mimamsa he made an observation that the rest of the shastra consisting
[14:54] nine chapters depends directly or indirectly upon the conclusions of present third adaya that is the significance of angad it is called angad and I am drawing your attention
[15:08] now today to another great author in ad vanta who is considered to be uh number two in the par of achar par of vant he
[15:20] is popularly called by Viara never his name is not at all known to the junior students but his name is prash prash prash but he is always referred to
[15:35] as so he wrote one padik there from a school in has begun there before that there was an existence
[15:47] bti school so there are two main schools after Shankar bhagat two main schools one is bti line of interpretation and the other one is via line of interpret a both of them are only some subtle
[16:02] differences here and there prash also says and this prash also speaks about I will we will be discussing them in detail
[16:17] Sak he says to understand the entire these six principles are analyzed by me here there are they are shti ling
[16:31] andak mimas have not only evolved these six principles but [Music] also these are also six they have some Fascination about the number six they
[16:51] invented yeah they invented six pranas for karma they invented six pranas for Kama they invented six pranas for Nadya more or less all their sets of
[17:05] principles carry the number six I do not know what kind of Fascination Jam was having for number six we must do some good research and find out
[17:17] peripherally uh that's of course you can forget about the comment now Shankar aara and Madara quoted the ja Sutra three 314 and acknowledge the
[17:31] importation of the above principles into their system that is mamakas principles are imported into vtin system however that my observation this is my personal
[17:43] observation shastra has no sanction and pandits do not agree however the nature the conception the application and the result of application in the two systems
[17:56] V mimamsa and vanta appear to differ from each other similarly the J Sutra quoted above clearly speaks about the weakness of the later principles in respect of earlier
[18:10] ones it is called parala theory of that is so linga is weak weaker than sui Waka is further weaker than both both linga Andi like that the samaka is the weakest
[18:32] principle weak in the sense you know when there is a clash between and samaka you should go byi not with samaka that that is to decide it they have Theory which is mostly maintained
[18:46] in the mimamsa system whereas in the vanta violations of the said Theory are significantly more in number this is how I say these six are not the the same six
[18:59] as MIM held anyway it is my personal view to make this point clear first of all we may examine the definitions of these principles provided in the respective two systems and secondly
[19:13] discuss the reasons for violation of parador Bala Theory the Sutra is this this is J Sutra 11 334 no I do not know J Sutra number
[19:25] it is quoted in uh no j JRA 3314 yesing third no it is shash reference okay I don't have reference
[19:48] number now coming to quickly I because little bit technical one so let us not deal with it very in detail superficially let us understand n there are see all that I want to say is there
[20:03] are two sets of Def definitions of the same principle in the mimamsa tradition that is one is apparently appears to be General and applicable in wider
[20:16] perspective the second one is very technical and applicable only to the mimamsa particular shastra and its PR and its need IT addresses only the need
[20:30] of Mima these two sets are revolved by MIM now what prash has done is he adopted the general one and ignored the technical one because his job is not
[20:43] rituals explanation of rituals his job is to decide about the Brahman meaning of the passage meaning of the some terms we will come to that
[20:55] so n everywhere I quoted it is one definition it means not very much it's very very weak in its construction but
[21:10] applies in a very wider area the the sound the shabda the word which has no AA or which has
[21:22] no of any other that is see for example if I say the word doesn't have any other AA
[21:36] for a person who of course know the it has no of anything more than knowing that it is so it is now you see how they have expanded in
[21:57] technically there are two principles is defined in two ways one is second one is these two terms once I explain but
[22:15] later on I don't do that means its is something else than itself for example a servant is there in the
[22:29] in an office his wesa is the manager of the office but he is subordinate to him Ang so manager is the principal and he is
[22:41] ang so is something other than itself then par that criteria makes the person or
[22:53] the thing or whatever it is a an Ang a limb to something else this is ang second is it should
[23:09] be for any it should be it should subordinate it should subordinate as aaka to a particular action once anything that is
[23:25] so so this part is Anga for bringing the water because bringing the water is ATI and part is a it without part we can't bring of
[23:40] course we can't bring the water so is also wherever you find it should naturally be Anga it cannot be principle it cannot be principle but is
[23:57] only Anga either in loc or the the or everywhere this this holds Good even human relations also it holds
[24:14] good now an example I simply go there is lot of discussion in every Adar so much of discussion are there so
[24:28] in is one word there is a as all of you know so the r is related to Indra related to Indra by what way praising the Indra so
[24:45] the Rick is in the form of praise to Indra for example now because of is is so what it comes to our mind first is this RI this particular Mantra of
[25:11] Indra deata should be used in theana then whose upana it should be on the on the capability of the word
[25:26] and the Mantra should be used only when you are invoking the god Indra it results from that but says this is the statement it is a
[25:45] sentence you can't alter it though the Mantra is devoted to Indra and indra's invocation prayer should be addressed to only the gab there are three agnis
[26:06] G and there are three fires through the help of Three Fires various Yas are performed and gab When you pray to the
[26:19] gab you should use this Indra Mantra how we decided it now this mantra Indra manra is the Ang for
[26:31] [Music] Gana now we got it how we did get it by its capability own capability by its other way if you if we say if it is left
[26:44] to us we may be using this Mantra to invoke the Indra God only not gag because is there but says so this Mantra becomes Ang for Ang
[27:04] ofana that is prayer addressed to so this is what is called and all that now now
[27:18] means means first two are now we have to analyze these definitions also in detail that is the job presently
[27:43] I engaged in peace definition is on the lines of that of old just it appears to be a little bit of explanation but the general one is adopted by prash Atman and the technical
[28:02] one is dropped because wean do not have any issue of Ang because there is in brah there is no Ang and Angi it is only to decide the meaning of the right meaning of a few
[28:17] terms the vant shastra goes on murar Mishra who wrote angti one small book Angi says
[28:28] n is ageold definition of older mimas he himself accepts that this is his word now I def it for as for the need of
[28:48] the ET etc etc says this is according to later m oh this second lak is because of Navas Navas
[29:03] means later so what we you can draw is the general definitions whatever they are they they were the real PR definitions and later on they have con
[29:18] what you call they have condensed the area of its application and defined it technically so to suit to m this exercise has been
[29:29] done because of their need only nothing later M brought in brought in concept of case ending which expresses
[29:40] auxil later M also later in the sense Beyond some people have added so P it should be a case ending
[29:56] according to Naim SAS for p it can be a word it can be a word it can be a sentence also or even a passage not necessarily to have case
[30:10] ending so this is the Striking dis similarity between MIM and prash definitions no no need to express auxil because he is not concerned with
[30:23] auxiliar precisely for the reason that prash at definition is non- Technical and general principal shuti is referred to in the Brahma sutras by its various
[30:35] synonyms generated from the root Shu such as shti Shana Etc usually technical terms cannot have a an equivalent other term
[30:48] usually means means only you can't replace the parasha GAA with any other word as long entire system
[31:01] means something so but here in brahmasutra we have got several synonyms that that itself is a proof that it is not technical it's not parash shabda is
[31:15] also used in the same sense directly in addition to these theti is referred to be a long list of its equivalent terms numbering 37 as long as I have observed they
[31:30] are let us skip it now linga is defined by the MIM sakas as the competence of words to indicate the auxil again this is pra definition
[31:44] they only told competence is the saming however this is however as in the case ofi the later
[32:06] MIM sakas defined it more technically as linga is the indicative competence possessed by the existent word to conjecture the expressive word which in turn convey either one of the two types
[32:20] of auxil namely intendedness towards something that is pares or being an instrument in accomplishing an action means a kind of
[32:47] grass the verb is used soak is the root so it is cutting d means therefore where should this Mantra it is a
[33:02] mantra this Mantra where should it be used in the action of cutting the B cutting the kind of grass called bar how do how do we know this Anga
[33:16] cutting of the grass is the Angi Kaa and Anga is this Mantra how did we know that because dami the word though aak itself has got some
[33:29] competency and compar capability to express its angat towards cutting the grass therefore this is linga now let me quickly go through
[33:43] prash Atman defines linga as linga is the indicative capacity of Words which is of the nature of an invariable relation with a distinct meaning this is
[33:56] added by prash at an invariable relation with a distinct meaning is added by Brahman is the distinct meaning they want to prove so any
[34:08] any or any property that has been spelled out in a sentence which happens to be connected with the Brahman in an invariable relation that is linga on that on the
[34:23] strength of it they prove that it is the term is brah Ling Capac in short it is the indicative meaning obtained on the basis of a distinctive characteristic expressed
[34:44] there linga is used about 16 times in the Brahma suas either in support of sidak orak is defined by the as
[34:57] again this is old one old definition Sahara means uttering in a sequence in its wider perspective the term vaka should signify all the sentences of the Veda therefore both shti and linga may
[35:11] also fall under vaka in some sense or other hence to distinguish the special characteristic of this technical term vaka it is explained by them as vaka is
[35:24] utterance of words in a sequence denoting the principle of auxiliar without such words being possessed of case endings which signify the auxil
[35:36] directly because auxil directly by case endings is a so there is no there should not be a VII to prove the angwa but the entire
[35:49] sentence should have a capability to show that it is an Ang with something let us go to example then only these things will be somewhat clear ET is the
[36:11] same now one more thing the scholars should note that in the system of mimamsa every later principle though it
[36:21] may it may help you to decide the angwa and sentence meaning and all that it should uh it should create it should one minute English words are
[36:37] sometimes cause problem uh uh that is uh it should uh they want they they what they say is
[37:00] Waka should artificially create linga a sentence with linga and linga should again generate a sentence of shti then only the sentential meaning will come
[37:17] this one has to exam we have to keep these things in our mind how the computer will will also ask for it whether directly vaka cannot give the meaning of the angwa it should create in
[37:30] between linga Andi because what I felt is as a general scholar without any computational background what I felt is for
[37:41] m is only one PR because it is an Al relationship between doing a ritual and getting a result it's not loc it's not from any other PR we know if we do will
[37:56] get SW there is no there is no way to know the relation between joa and except V so therefore V is only in the form of shasi
[38:10] SOA cannot decide it should only should decide therefore and is not there only is there so what you should do isti
[38:22] should what you call kalp kalpana uh English word should imagine should imagine the not imagine you have to you have to generate
[38:36] the lingaa and then you have to generate suaka and then only it will become its Ang this is some technical system they have which technical issue has been dispensed with
[38:50] in the vant that's what I wanted to emphasize vtin are closer to our competition Linguistics uh let us see I hope I am clear now
[39:10] example the for the for the person who performs the ritual juu means a kind of spoon Chamas is also spoon is also spoon in through
[39:24] which is put into the fire you know some wooden they put every day Ina they put G with some wooden spoon uh that svbc channel you can see that is

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
39:39] what is called juu and this juu should be done by what kind of wood you see every particular is to be given by V ritual means you have no Swant at all whatever is told in the you have to
[39:53] follow the same thing so there are so many woods you doing juu is only 2 minute job no you there are prescriptions for to do with particular wood and all that there a sentence is
[40:07] there for which the happens to be parna is a kind of tree parna is a kind of
[40:17] tree juu which is made of par wood if he holds it and if he performs the sacrifice for him there is in throughout his entire life there will not be any
[40:34] detriments of doing anything or any loss of property or or anything that's all that means always he be
[40:46] happy that's what the sentence says Nowa is is this Ang to decide this Anga there is no because is not
[41:02] there it is only so there is no VI case ending so this is not the case of shi and it is not linga because linga is mostly by one word here it is a sentence
[41:17] the full sentence has got the capability therefore it is suas we do not come across any reference to the principal vaka directly but we find three sutras where a
[41:32] possibility of a reference is felt to some extent they are in all the three places cited above the text which follows the present vak is referred to by the term vaka as per
[41:48] the Shankar's commentary though explanation of Sahara may not be very difficult in these cases yet it is difficult from imam's conception of the term vaka let us move prash Atman
[42:02] defines vaka as the capability of several words this expects both the dentive meaning shti and indicative meaning of the words in deciding the relation of the denotative and indicative meanings
[42:17] of the words given to our knowledge by the primary and secondary powers of words def the pr as Mutual expectancy there are five sentences in a
[42:33] sequence namely which enjoying rituals called there are five are there for none of these five no
[42:48] result is told by the V so they have got an A of what is my result if I do what is my pal that is I'm going to get
[42:59] Pala is there and see the far after sometime or before that there is one sentence is prescribed for fora how to do it has not been
[43:24] spelled by spelled out there damasa is a big activity but it has got some subordinate activities cooking food is only we say simply cooking food but it has got several hundreds of actions
[43:37] before actually the um food is food is ready you know hundreds of actions not even I'm not exaggerating hundreds of them so what similarly in ritual also there are aant rituals they have not
[43:53] been told there so it has got some how shall I how should Thea be done so sentence has got an AA of which is
[44:09] called K how shall I how should it be performed and have got what is my result
[44:22] so now combine both of them so this all five prayas are to be treated as limbs of Damas otherwise how does how do we
[44:35] know there are five limbs of D Masa this is how mimas explain the huge mindboggling size of Vic sentences into a proper system and evolve the form of
[44:49] the ritual even form of the rituals are not straight away told line by line everything in one place it is the Vic literature is a very big problem I tell you it is easy to recite but you enter
[45:03] into that you are sooner you enter into it you are lost such a problematic huge carpus of literature is given to us by whom God
[45:15] knows Etc which enjoins rituals called prayas without mentioning the result of such rituals therefore all these five sentences carry acceptance expectancy
[45:27] with regard to their result so so this is M there is another text namely the
[45:40] ritual and its result is but but the sentence it did not say the therefore this sentence has got
[45:53] K this arises the therefore arises Mutual expectancy prash Atman defines prar as the capability of two sentences objects of which are contextual on the
[46:08] basis of either Mutual expectancy or expectancy on the part of any one of the two [Music] sentences at defines prara as the
[46:27] capability of two sentences oh sorry the principle prara is cited in the Brahma sutras for about eight times in one of these sutras we find the term prwa used in
[46:41] another Sutra 2312 the term adhikara in place of prar in all these instances it is found that the word prara is used in a non-technical general sense of context but not in the technical sense of mutual
[46:55] ual expectancy in the Sutra 1210 prar the text of the K is cited in support of the argument that context belongs to the Brahman and not to the fire or ja which in turn helps to decide the meaning of
[47:10] the word at there is a is is described in the is the sentence of in
[47:32] which who is this Dev is it a human person or is it or even outside the or Brahman this is the Dilemma that that is to be
[47:45] resolved in the Brahma sutras and it is decided in favor of the brah why because entire human race brah only are the pickups they stand representative of
[48:03] the entire entire is for only the Brahman because a person can eat only a little bit of meat or something not he cannot Devour the
[48:19] entire Dev stated in the text of again in the sura the text is cited to prove that the context belongs to Brahman which in turn help to decide the meaning
[48:32] of the text of the mundaka in favor of Brahman in the instances cited above the two texts are the meaning of the two texts are not in mutual expectancy that is what I am underlining as in the case
[48:46] of prayas andas hence the term prara is used in the Brahma sutras in a general and non-technical sense it is precisely because of this difference in its use synonyms of prar such
[48:59] asika could also have been used in fact the term prwa expresses the desired meaning of the context in a better way and that is why Shankar aara repeatedly
[49:10] used the word PR in his Basha the prar of vant vtin may be equated to the technical term of AR in the Mima tradition Stana is defined by the MIM as
[49:25] the place M of the two t in proximity they divide theana into and is again divided into and M give
[49:39] several examples to illustrate the application of the principle in their Tex I am not giving the examples because it will consume time prash defines aana as respective relation of two sets of
[49:54] sentences placed in in particular order in principle uh in principle this principle expects the cognition of the capability of two sentences which express two sets of different objects in
[50:07] a particular order let us browse through as far as the brah suas are concerned this principal Stana has not been used in them even though three sutras do have
[50:25] Stana word in them there the meaning of Stana is somewhat different from the Stana which we are discussing I made a note on that let us move samaka is defined as a word rooted in eological
[50:40] meaning a spoon is called hamasa this is interesting a spoon is called hamasa its name is hamasa because of the capability of the name itself the chasa means again
[50:53] spoon wooden spoon by which something can be eaten so who should eat by this spoon it is only H should eat by that spoon the other priests should eat the
[51:07] same Pura with other spoons than the hamasa because hamasa name itself carries that this particular spoon is Anga for the eating of the priest called
[51:22] H by mere name it gives Anga IA this is how they enter into the system sentences and come out with some good results following the etimology of the word hu he is obliged to eat by it
[51:37] and not by any other means in this way the hamasa which is eological in its nature functions as a principle of deciding the auxil of chasa to H we find
[51:49] this principle cited in the Brahma sutras once 333 338 Sam here is made on the basis of that the should be treated as one and the
[52:06] same actually it is not quoted in brahmas suas we can say because it is cited only with regard to puraka whether it is puraka or sidhant it has been used in the Brahma sutras that's what we want
[52:18] to express prash defines samaka as the capability of name in establishing a relation between two meanings which have been known from two different sentences
[52:31] this principle expects all the earlier principles in deciding a meaning okay scheme of except in the case of shti it is capability that acts as the characterist
[52:55] of being the principle of interpretation these are some points noteworthy to note uh principle principle of interpretation
[53:04] is the only except sui the other five do have only capability as one of the characteristics capability is defined as prash Atman has defined as uh the state
[53:20] of being related through an invariable relation with a distinct meaning we have seen it in defining the Ling if a single now you see he a scheme which is very interesting if a single word
[53:36] possesses such capability it is linga if many words put together possess that capability it is vaka if it lies in two separate
[53:49] sentences consisting several words each it is prar if it rests with two sentences and the two sentences establish a relation on the basis of order of the place of objects in both
[54:04] the sentences it is a and if it lies with some capability lies with mere Sam or name in different chapters or texts it
[54:18] is samak so therefore there is a scheme behind prash at's understanding of these principles we can see a kind of progression in the said capability Sam
[54:29] from P level to vaka Waka level to level to along with respective relation to to
[54:45] and this is the distinctive and significant contribution of prash in understanding these principles another important contribution of prash Atman in this regard is his statement that every
[54:58] lat principle expects the previous principles in giving rise to the meaning there is no CP there is no no need of generating the non-existence sentence as such in vanta but
[55:13] expectation is there that's why everything will expect only suti ultimately uh meaning according to him this is the reason for the weakness of principle than previous principles
[55:27] naturally latter principle expects the previous one so it becomes weak and the previous principle happens to be strong however prash Atman has not expressively stated anywhere that every latter
[55:40] principle should assume what a kalp assume I trans here I was searching there should assume the previous Principle as is accepted by the mimas this expectation of previous principles
[55:53] is well understandable because prash scheme is from P level to mahak level and the expectancy of a vaka towards padas and a mahavakya towards
[56:06] vakas is an established fact in this way the theory of par is retained by prash following M prash as
[56:19] well as Shankar bhagat quot the J Sutra as I already told striking dissimilar it is the dropping of the component of auxiliar by prash Atman prash at's
[56:30] definitions and definitions of world mimar Mamas are mutually closer from this important observation of theory of
[56:44] no sublation of weaker principle by the stronger principle in peace [Music] SK it is harmonizing or explaining away
[56:57] of the weaking weaker principle to fall in line with the meaning of the stronger principle there is no sublation as such but somewhat it should be made diluted the meaning of the second sentence is to
[57:10] be diluted which has to fall in line with the sentence that is held to be stronger the meaning of the weaker principle is also retained but modified on the basis of well accepted norms for
[57:24] that also again Norms are there from the discussion on definitions made so far two distinctive features of these principles emerge firstly a general and broad-based nature secondly a particular
[57:36] Technical and with limited applicability mamakas adopt the second and the vedantins the first mamaka use them for explaining the ularity whereas vedantins as criteria to decide the meaning of
[57:49] terms sentences and passages mamakas prefer Assumption of earlier principle by later principles to essentially to be valid means of knowledge such assumption is not
[58:02] contemplated by vedantins though parala theory is accepted violation of parala theory is occasional in mimamsa whereas it is very common in the vant shastra
[58:16] there is a strong case to treat these principles as two sets of principles with IDE identical names based on the conception definition and application but Shankar bhagat is explicit in saying
[58:29] that there is only one set of principles evolved by the MIM that is 3349 not only sh inra
[58:44] itself there is one more sura because even accepts that these are the MIM principles but defined in a different way as I mention of reconciliation we may say that these six principles are
[58:58] originally principles of artics prani mamakas have used them Contracting their nature and applicability where things used them as they are the reason for such difference
[59:12] in approach is mamakas are concerned with the explanation of karma whereas vtin are concerned with the explanation of Brahman karma is
[59:23] sadya and in need of auxiliar karma is in need of auxiliaries and it is sadya it is not sidha and Brahman is sidha and the
[59:37] nature of Revelation and of the nature of Revelation on the basis of is there between and which has been sh in detail explains under Sutra
[59:58] 111 mimas have never been explicit in stating that these are determinants of meaning they said they never said they are the meaning determinants of meaning neither the V expressly told
[01:00:16] it just is that prara is a well-known means of understanding both in v and Loca but my opinion is he may be referring to the
[01:00:33] pr of the set of 14 principles explained by and maybe he is referring to that we have to examine it I'm not conclusively saying anything it is only prash in the
[01:00:57] tradition and vas in the tradition have stated this difference in clear teres violations of par in vant are more in number than observance ground for
[01:01:11] such violations is the support of TPA in almost all instances six principles of are called lingas they are [Music]
[01:01:28] near unanimity in defining them and application of them no problem with mimas andan with regard to lingas again they are also six the six number goes
[01:01:40] on I I showed in which which is used which is not now necessary both the sets of principles now the question is both
[01:01:55] six andradi 6 are used in the Brahma sutras even in the Sutra also they are mentioned why if both of them areas why so there
[01:02:09] is a very interesting one uh I think I should not have I take much time so I will not elaborate on that but I made some points they are mut they are not mutually
[01:02:21] exclusive they depend on each other because deciding the meaning of a word or sentence depends upon the strength of TP and T in turn depends upon the
[01:02:38] appearance of Shadi principles in the beginning and the end of the passage what is Samara one and the same word is in the beginning of a text and in the end of the text suppose Brahman the word
[01:02:52] the second Val of uh it starts with Brahma word in the beginning and in the last sentence also again Brahman word is there so andar the Brahman word is there so the entire
[01:03:09] context in between belongs to the brah this is what is called but how this but in there must be a shda there must be a word denoting a particular object in the beginning and
[01:03:25] end that is so lingas do depend upon lingas similarly to decide the strength and weakness of surad lingas tya is the driving force so there is a kind of
[01:03:41] inter relation between these two six and six principles Al together 12 principles because deciding the meaning of a word or sentence depends upon the strength of TPA and TP in turn depends upon the
[01:03:55] appearance of Sadi principles in the beginning and end of a passage abasa means repeated appearance there are six therefore bad relied on both the sets of
[01:04:08] principles comes technically it is asked see no question has been left out in our text what I feel is sincerely we not we need not do any puraka even for the sake
[01:04:24] of even God is there existent or not even NASA ASA everything they have been thoroughly discussed in books only it is our mistake that we did not read them and again going on doing our own mental
[01:04:39] exercise to prove or disprove they are written there only we we don't have patience to go through the complete shastri one aash I picked up shall I
[01:04:50] take five minutes little more hear itself okay now I will then I will put up in my words this or otherwise I read
[01:05:04] it three slides are there aashik is one is the question asked by the student the teacher replied now what is the meaning of
[01:05:25] Akasha what comes to your mind immediately Akasha means the space that comes to our for mind and in which from boyhood mean every commoner also is
[01:05:38] using Akasha word in the same sense so it is a pridi Rudi is there and also it is in the beginning of the text first sentence aasha is in the beginning of the word beginning has got some more
[01:05:51] strength that is it is called see the first word carries greater strength than the second word because when the first word is uttered or born his rival is not born so when first
[01:06:09] child is born he is very strong in All Families the reason is when he is born he or she is Born the second child is not born the second child is always weaker in All Families Because by the
[01:06:22] time the second child is born the one is already in existence it is called These are several thousands of these apart from are there in our texts
[01:06:36] sometimes they are even also so in both the ways aasha what should be the meaning of aasha space but now it has been decided
[01:06:47] aing in this particular adik brahmasutra bad Mahi has decided that that Akasha the by the word Akasha it is only the supreme ultimate reality which is called
[01:07:01] Brahman is the meaning of aasha word how he derived how he derived it lingas are there for it what are the Ling just for a moment you see
[01:07:26] four sentences are there all the things in the world whatever it is wherever it is inas they are all are born from out of
[01:07:35] aasha they all get what you call De in the pra they Lina they go into again back into the Brahman and Akasha is the biggest of all because he is
[01:07:51] giving birth to all the things in including aash and then he is the paray he is the ultimate goal of reach now these four lingas cannot be applicable to
[01:08:07] aash though to some extent aasha is also bigger one because first born is a if you go to first God has provided food then only he
[01:08:30] created the Jas see the see the compassion of the god according to our belief first an is produced and then person is produced because after giving
[01:08:44] birth how he will sustain himself okay now this aasha is also bigger one but now in
[01:08:59] this let us conclude linga has become more powerful and greatly carried greater strength than
[01:09:13] actual is but is diluted this is the magic of vant shastra which is not the case in Mima us they don't allow this this to happen
[01:09:27] only because we are concerned with the meaning therefore because and all the objects of the entire universe getting originated and getting involuted into the one entity that
[01:09:41] entity cannot be the bhakha that entity cannot be the space what we see but it can be something more than Ultimate Reality so it is the Brahman it is decided linga has
[01:09:54] Gotti is the on the support of upti linga has become stringier and shti has become
[01:10:05] weaker and this Akasha word denotes only the Brahman this is subject thank you [Applause] all [Music]
[01:10:29] so much uh thoughts you have G so much material you have given us for Thought uh I don't know what what to say now but
[01:10:40] uh what I have observed is this uh prakash prash at prash atti he has given
[01:10:51] a very good uh step by- step procedure toour analysis and uh so we start with the sentences then we start combine the two sentences and then we go to the
[01:11:08] paragraphs and all that so that is something which is really very uh useful from the discourse analysis point of
[01:11:17] view I see and uh uh we need to discuss this further in detail to understand how we can use these uh pramanas these uh
[01:11:32] six two sets of six pranas for discourse analysis and um we will be troubling you uh again and again in order to
[01:11:45] understand this but what I the the point the thing which I will take back is uh rather than mimansa KAS I would would like to go with the vantes because
[01:11:56] vianes are uh more into the meaning part of it uh and this is what we also need so maybe we will go for those 119 pranas
[01:12:08] given by uh the uh uh the vedantis and uh thank you very much for actually I'm working on that 191 adikas as briefed by prash
[01:12:24] has brought out the logical framework behind each into written by him I am translating and annotating and Expos with Exposition uh
[01:12:37] for icpr National Fellowship so so that will be really very and I need help of all the scholars available here at various points more so help of amaji at
[01:12:49] that time so we we will definitely like to uh read those things and see how those are useful for computational purpose as well because I see the potential there so thank you very much

<h2>Chapter 4. Speech Focus: Discourse Analysis</h2><h3>4.1. Introduction to Discourse Analysis</h3><p>Discourse analysis, a pivotal area in linguistic studies, delves into the structures of written and spoken communication. It seeks to understand how language functions in various contexts to convey meaning, construct identities, and establish social relationships. This analytical approach is instrumental in examining the subtleties of communication, allowing scholars to decode the multifaceted nature of texts and conversations.</p><h3>4.2. Relationship Between Texts and Paragraphs</h3><p>Understanding the relationship between texts and paragraphs is crucial in discourse analysis. Each paragraph serves as a building block that contributes to the overall coherence and cohesion of a text. Analyzing these relationships involves:</p><ul><li><strong>Identifying Themes and Subthemes</strong>: Each paragraph typically introduces a theme or subtheme that supports the main argument or narrative of the text.</li><li><strong>Coherence and Cohesion</strong>: Coherence refers to the logical connections between ideas, while cohesion pertains to the linguistic elements (such as conjunctions and pronouns) that link sentences and paragraphs together.</li><li><strong>Transition Mechanisms</strong>: Effective transitions between paragraphs ensure that the text flows smoothly, guiding the reader through the argument or narrative without confusion.</li></ul><h3>4.3. Parameters for Analysis and Interpretation</h3><p>To systematically analyze and interpret discourse, several key parameters must be considered:</p><h4>Contextual Factors</h4><ul><li><strong>Situational Context</strong>: Understanding the circumstances under which the communication occurs, including the time, place, and social setting.</li><li><strong>Cultural Context</strong>: Recognizing the cultural background and norms that influence the way language is used and interpreted.</li></ul><h4>Linguistic Features</h4><ul><li><strong>Lexical Choices</strong>: The specific words chosen by the speaker or writer, which can reveal much about their attitudes, intentions, and the social context.</li><li><strong>Syntactic Structures</strong>: The arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences, which can affect the clarity and persuasiveness of the text.</li></ul><h4>Interactional Dynamics</h4><ul><li><strong>Turn-Taking</strong>: In spoken discourse, how speakers take turns, which can indicate power dynamics and conversational control.</li><li><strong>Adjacency Pairs</strong>: Common patterns in dialogue, such as question-answer or greeting-response sequences, that structure interactions.</li></ul><h4>Discourse Markers</h4><p>Discourse markers are words or phrases that organize discourse into segments, signaling the relationship between these segments. Examples include:</p><ul><li><strong>Additive Markers</strong>: Words like "and," "also," and "furthermore" that add information.</li><li><strong>Adversative Markers</strong>: Words like "but," "however," and "on the other hand" that introduce contrast or opposition.</li><li><strong>Causal Markers</strong>: Words like "because," "therefore," and "thus" that indicate cause-and-effect relationships.</li></ul><h3>Connecting Evidence to Analysis</h3><p>To build a robust analysis, one must connect specific textual evidence to broader interpretive claims. This involves:</p><ol><li><strong>Identifying Key Passages</strong>: Selecting relevant excerpts from the text that illustrate the main themes and linguistic features.</li><li><strong>Analyzing Linguistic Features</strong>: Examining how lexical choices, syntactic structures, and discourse markers contribute to the overall meaning.</li><li><strong>Contextualizing Findings</strong>: Placing the analysis within the broader situational and cultural context to provide a deeper understanding of the text.</li></ol><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The systematic approach to discourse analysis outlined above enables scholars to dissect the intricate layers of meaning embedded in texts. By examining the relationships between paragraphs, considering contextual factors, and analyzing linguistic features, one can uncover the underlying structures that shape communication. This methodical analysis not only enhances our comprehension of individual texts but also enriches our understanding of the complex dynamics of language in use.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Indian Hermeneutical Tradition</h2><h3>5.1. Overview of Hermeneutical Tradition</h3><p>The Indian hermeneutical tradition is a profound and intricate field dedicated to the interpretation of sacred texts. Rooted in ancient philosophies, it encompasses various schools of thought, each with unique methodologies for deciphering scriptures. This tradition aims to unveil the deeper meanings and truths embedded within religious and philosophical texts, providing insights into the human condition and the nature of reality.</p><h3>5.2. Principles Used by Mimamsakas</h3><p>Mimamsakas, the proponents of the Mimamsa school, focus on the interpretation of Vedic texts, particularly the rituals and injunctions prescribed within them. Their principles include:</p><ul><li><strong>Apurva</strong>: The concept of the unseen force generated by the performance of Vedic rituals, which is believed to produce future benefits.</li><li><strong>Tatparya (TPA)</strong>: Emphasis on discerning the intended meaning or purport of a text, ensuring that interpretations align with the overall purpose of the scripture.</li><li><strong>Linga (Indicators)</strong>: Utilizing linguistic and contextual indicators to derive meaning, including markers such as proximity, sequence, and context within the text.</li><li><strong>Arthavada</strong>: Interpretative statements that praise or criticize actions to highlight their significance or infer a deeper meaning.</li><li><strong>Upakrama and Upasamhara</strong>: Considering the beginning and conclusion of a text to ascertain its central theme.</li></ul><h3>5.3. Principles Used by Vedantins</h3><p>Vedantins, scholars of the Vedanta school, focus on the philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutras. Their interpretative principles include:</p><ul><li><strong>Shruti (Heard Texts)</strong>: Prioritizing the authority of the Upanishads and other Vedic texts as direct revelations.</li><li><strong>Anubhava (Experience)</strong>: Validating interpretations through personal spiritual experiences and realizations.</li><li><strong>Tatparya (Purpose)</strong>: Similar to the Mimamsa approach, Vedantins also emphasize discerning the central purpose or intended meaning of the texts.</li><li><strong>Adhyasa (Superimposition)</strong>: Recognizing the superimposition of the unreal on the real, a fundamental concept in understanding the nature of reality and illusion.</li><li><strong>Bhaga-tyaga-lakshana</strong>: The method of distinguishing between literal and implied meanings to reconcile apparent contradictions within texts.</li></ul><h3>5.4. Comparative Analysis: Mimamsakas vs. Vedantins</h3><p>The Mimamsa and Vedanta schools, while both rooted in Vedic traditions, differ significantly in their interpretative approaches and focal points:</p><h4>Focus and Objectives</h4><ul><li><strong>Mimamsakas</strong>: Primarily concerned with the performance of Vedic rituals and the practical aspects of dharma (duty), emphasizing precise ritualistic interpretations.</li><li><strong>Vedantins</strong>: Focus on the philosophical and metaphysical teachings of the Upanishads, aiming to understand the nature of Brahman (ultimate reality) and the self.</li></ul><h4>Methodological Differences</h4><ul><li><strong>Textual Emphasis</strong>: Mimamsakas give precedence to the earlier portions of the Vedas (Samhitas and Brahmanas), which contain hymns and rituals. Vedantins prioritize the latter portions (Upanishads), which are more philosophical.</li><li><strong>Interpretative Techniques</strong>: Mimamsakas employ a more grammatical and contextual analysis, while Vedantins often use metaphysical and experiential methods.</li></ul><h4>Conceptual Divergence</h4><ul><li><strong>Nature of Reality</strong>: Mimamsakas focus on the tangible benefits and outcomes of ritual actions, viewing them as essential for maintaining cosmic order. Vedantins seek to transcend ritualistic practices, emphasizing self-realization and liberation (moksha) as the ultimate goal.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The Indian hermeneutical tradition, through the lenses of Mimamsa and Vedanta, offers a rich tapestry of interpretative methodologies. While Mimamsakas provide a detailed framework for understanding the ritualistic and dharmic aspects of the Vedas, Vedantins open a gateway to the profound philosophical insights of the Upanishads. Together, these schools contribute to a comprehensive understanding of Vedic literature, enriching the spiritual and intellectual heritage of India.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Technical Aspects of Mimamsa Tradition</h2><h3>6.1. Key Principles: TPA (Tatparya) and Linga</h3><p>The Mimamsa tradition, with its focus on Vedic exegesis, employs sophisticated techniques to ascertain the precise meaning of texts. Central to this tradition are the principles of Tatparya (TPA) and Linga, which together form the cornerstone of Mimamsa interpretative methodology.</p><h4>Tatparya (TPA)</h4><p><strong>Tatparya</strong> refers to the intended meaning or purport of a text. In the Mimamsa framework, determining the Tatparya is crucial because it ensures that the interpreter grasps the overall purpose and context of the scripture, rather than just the literal meaning of individual words or sentences. The process involves several steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Contextual Analysis</strong>: Understanding the surrounding text and its broader context to identify the overarching theme.</li><li><strong>Purpose Identification</strong>: Determining the specific intent behind a particular passage or verse, which may involve looking at the text's beginning, conclusion, and any reiterative statements.</li><li><strong>Consistency Check</strong>: Ensuring that the interpreted meaning aligns with the overall teaching and philosophy of the scripture, avoiding contradictions.</li></ol><h4>Linga (Indicators)</h4><p><strong>Linga</strong> are indicators or markers within the text that help derive meaning. Mimamsakas use various types of Linga to clarify ambiguities and establish clear interpretations. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Proximity (Sannidhi)</strong>: The closer a word is to another within the text, the stronger the implied connection.</li><li><strong>Sequence (Krama)</strong>: The order in which words or sentences appear can influence their interpretation, indicating a logical progression or relationship.</li><li><strong>Repetition (Abhyasa)</strong>: Repeated terms or phrases suggest emphasis and importance.</li><li><strong>Consistency (Yukti)</strong>: Ensuring logical coherence within the text and with established doctrine.</li><li><strong>Specificity (Vishesha)</strong>: Specific terms or unique expressions that provide precise meaning.</li></ul><h3>6.2. Importance of Generating Linga for Understanding Sentence Meanings</h3><p>The generation and application of Linga are vital for understanding the meanings of sentences within the Mimamsa tradition. This meticulous approach ensures that interpretations are not only contextually accurate but also philosophically consistent. Here’s why Linga generation is essential:</p><h4>Clarifying Ambiguities</h4><p>Texts, especially those as ancient and complex as the Vedas, often contain ambiguous or multi-layered meanings. By generating Linga, interpreters can identify the most appropriate meaning based on context and consistency with the overall doctrine.</p><h4>Establishing Coherence</h4><p>Linga helps in maintaining coherence across different parts of the text. By identifying markers and indicators, interpreters can ensure that their understanding aligns with the text’s broader narrative and philosophical framework.</p><h4>Enhancing Precision</h4><p>Generating Linga allows for a more precise interpretation of the text. It helps in dissecting complex sentences, understanding nuanced meanings, and avoiding misinterpretations that could arise from a superficial reading.</p><h3>Practical Application: Step-by-Step Process</h3><p>To illustrate the application of Tatparya and Linga, consider the following steps typically undertaken in Mimamsa interpretation:</p><ol><li><strong>Initial Reading</strong>: Conduct a thorough initial reading to grasp the overall context and flow.</li><li><strong>Identify Key Terms</strong>: Highlight significant words or phrases that appear to carry substantial meaning.</li><li><strong>Generate Linga</strong>: Look for indicators such as repetition, proximity, and sequence to generate potential meanings.</li><li><strong>Contextual Cross-Check</strong>: Cross-check these meanings with the broader context to ensure consistency.</li><li><strong>Purport Determination</strong>: Determine the Tatparya by synthesizing the generated meanings with the identified purpose of the text.</li></ol><p>By following this rigorous methodology, Mimamsakas achieve a deep and accurate understanding of Vedic texts, ensuring that their interpretations are both faithful to the original intent and relevant to contemporary contexts. The precision and thoroughness of this approach underscore the sophistication of the Mimamsa tradition in the realm of scriptural interpretation.</p>

Mimamsa Principles and Computational Linguistics</h3><p><strong>Claim</strong>: The principles of Mimamsa, particularly those related to textual interpretation and meaning generation, share significant parallels with modern computational linguistics, providing a robust framework for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.</p><p><strong>Grounds</strong>: Mimamsa principles such as Tatparya (intended meaning) and Linga (indicators) focus on deriving accurate interpretations from complex texts. These principles are analogous to techniques in computational linguistics that aim to parse, understand, and generate human language in a computational context.</p><p><strong>Warrant</strong>: By examining the core methodologies of both Mimamsa and computational linguistics, we can identify how ancient interpretive techniques can inform and enhance modern NLP algorithms.</p><h3>7.2. Generating Linga in Computational Context</h3><p><strong>Claim</strong>: The concept of Linga, or textual indicators, can be effectively adapted for use in computational models to improve the accuracy of text interpretation and generation.</p><p><strong>Grounds</strong>: Linga involves identifying contextual markers within a text to ascertain meaning. In computational linguistics, similar markers—such as keywords, semantic roles, and syntactic structures—are used to train models to understand and generate human language.</p><p><strong>Warrant</strong>: Implementing a structured approach to identify and leverage Linga within computational models can enhance the precision of NLP tasks. For instance:</p><ol><li><strong>Keyword Extraction</strong>: Just as Linga identifies significant terms within a text, computational models extract keywords to determine the main topics and themes.</li><li><strong>Semantic Role Labeling</strong>: Linga’s focus on the relationship between words parallels semantic role labeling, which assigns roles to entities within a sentence to understand their functions.</li><li><strong>Syntactic Parsing</strong>: The sequential and logical relationships highlighted by Linga are akin to syntactic parsing, where the grammatical structure of a sentence is analyzed to deduce meaning.</li></ol><h3>7.3. Similarities in Analytical Approaches</h3><p><strong>Claim</strong>: The analytical approaches of Mimamsa and computational linguistics are inherently similar, both aiming to deconstruct and interpret complex language constructs.</p><p><strong>Grounds</strong>: Both disciplines employ detailed methodologies to break down texts into comprehensible units and derive meaning from them. Mimamsa uses principles such as context, purpose, and consistency, while computational linguistics utilizes algorithms and statistical models to achieve similar goals.</p><p><strong>Warrant</strong>: The intersection of these analytical approaches reveals a shared objective: to create systems that can understand and interpret language accurately. Key similarities include:</p><ul><li><strong>Contextual Analysis</strong>: Mimamsa’s emphasis on context mirrors computational methods that consider surrounding text to improve comprehension and relevance.</li><li><strong>Purpose Identification</strong>: Understanding the intent behind a text in Mimamsa is akin to sentiment analysis and intention recognition in NLP, where algorithms determine the underlying sentiment or purpose of a message.</li><li><strong>Consistency and Coherence</strong>: Ensuring interpretations are consistent within the larger textual framework is a principle in both Mimamsa and computational linguistics. In NLP, this is achieved through coherence models that maintain logical flow in generated text.</li></ul><h3>Practical Implications for NLP</h3><p><strong>Claim</strong>: Integrating Mimamsa principles into computational linguistics can provide novel insights and methodologies for improving NLP applications.</p><p><strong>Grounds</strong>: By adopting Mimamsa techniques, NLP systems can be enhanced to better handle complex texts, ambiguous meanings, and nuanced interpretations.</p><p><strong>Warrant</strong>: Practical applications include:</p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced Text Parsing</strong>: Utilizing Linga-inspired markers to refine parsing algorithms, leading to more accurate syntactic and semantic analyses.</li><li><strong>Improved Contextual Understanding</strong>: Applying Tatparya principles to develop models that better grasp the intended meaning of texts, particularly in complex or context-dependent scenarios.</li><li><strong>Refined Text Generation</strong>: Leveraging Mimamsa’s coherence and consistency checks to produce more logically structured and contextually relevant generated text.</li></ul><p>By exploring the synergies between Mimamsa and computational linguistics, we can unlock new potentials in NLP, bridging ancient wisdom with cutting-edge technology to advance the field of language processing.</p>
