[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] so the original Easter egg uh Egyptian word for sarcophagus was actually you know a Greek word and before that it was like or something really hard to pronounce because that's how they talk in Egypt I swear that's true and so the
[00:14] uh but the concept was it's an egg and the sarcophagus was was actually uh it was the cheapest of sarcophagy was a single layered uh
[00:27] thing um the the better off you were the more psyche you had I would even argue the more layers or eggs of of shell that you
[00:41] had in your sarcophagus and so you'd have these death plates uh forgive me PR my lips that's not the exact term but these like little plates so you'd have a sarcophagus itself but then you'd have like these layered plates that would lay on top of you and these were death masks
[00:55] and it was really important to realize that the mask was two-sided that uh what you saw inside the sarcophagus was probably even more important than what you saw if you were outside the
[01:09] sarcophagus and to me that's that's really moving because it really does showcase to you kind of the animism giving you that internal purpose for art rather than the external one
[01:21] right that that the first the first remnants of us making art were just like in meso America where I would show you the the uh uh uh some of the it's not uh
[01:36] I can't remember her name but the the bone lady that's turned upside down and facing into the dirt they're they're putting all this effort into the carving but the carving itself is actually facing down none of them get to see it
[01:50] and the same concept in Egypt exists inside the sarcophagus and all these different layers and eggs and things like that so the original meaning of Easter uh really predates Judaism and predates Christianity of course uh
[02:05] because it really does come back to this Egyptian concept of rebirth you were resurrecting Yourself by entering into the sarcophagus and I realized that we we
[02:18] like to think that the the Christian ideal of Resurrection was was their invention uh but but it it really wasn't in fact in a lot of ways if you look at what the Egyptian Book of the Dead is
[02:31] telling you how it's how it's explaining to you what where what and how we are in this world uh in in a way Resurrection is simply trying to accept that story but turn it on its end because we have
[02:47] already been resurrected the Egyptians going to tell you guys that when you're born that is your resurrection that that the moment that you're born you've already died this is the underworld
[03:00] okay so all of the uh the essence of of who and what you know is based on that AC DC that a d BC
[03:14] do you see the difference AC DC a d and BC that the there's a a zero point line and that line is linear from a
[03:29] point forward and that line is retro from a point backwards and that those two things occur on a very special day and that very special day is actually today and the Cherokee would say that
[03:43] that the dawn began in the sunset the the the the the dusk was the beginning of the day and so too the Jews would say that spring itself this Passover place
[03:57] this is the time when all it's born uh we'll we'll we'll get to this in a few slides James so just just move on I got all the slides when you when you look at the atmology of
[04:12] Eucharist the definition of that word actually means Thanksgiving um in Greek Eucharist tiat I'm prend you pronounce that right in Hebrew
[04:23] Baraka and these bir both are words of of thanks of thankfulness additionally in Matthew and Mark and uh Luke and
[04:36] Corinthians 1 all these references to the Last Supper share one more than one thing but one thing I want you to notice for this stream that they share in common is that every one of those times
[04:48] Jesus is giving thanks so when you consider what the Eucharist is it's a Thanksgiving that the very first Thanksgiving was was actually and is the word
[05:02] Eucharist and and we we sort of have a different connotation of that word I use we Loosely because the the the Christian going to have a different a different thought on that I would argue just just is I'm not trying to poke fun of anyone I consider myself Christian but I would
[05:17] argue that Christians don't even know what the word means and that uh Hebrews are just going to like steer all of their influence in into the political movement of escaping Israel I mean uh Egypt
[05:31] uh Egypt and and that that these two things are are the meaning of of this Eucharist but but the reason why that those two things mean this way is because of I'm going to say it the shame of what these things used to be was just
[05:45] so so so expensive and toxic that we were going to accept whatever story anyone could come up with to help us feel better about what actually is going
[05:56] on and and nothing else really says this uh more accurately I think than when we look at how Columbus uh the the letters of Columbus which I was just reading the other day
[06:12] uh some of them I should say uh described cannibalism the the most of the scholars that that look at Columbus um are very critical of his these are
[06:27] some of the words you might hear his race ual his racist ideas about cannibalism and assuming that that the the island the second island that he came across as he entered the West
[06:40] Indies he was told was a was a cannibal Island and he was told that he he was told that by the other members of the island and and that uh that that the word for cannibal actually came from those those Islanders the name for those
[06:55] Islanders and of course all this was dismissed then is saying yeah this just crazy stories keep in mind was looking for people with tals uh all kinds of stuff like that and and and so it's easy for us to dismiss the idea of
[07:08] cannibalism because we've already changed that word into giant or horrendous man or feral man these are would be interpretations that we've gone about to try and keep the truth in the
[07:20] room but try and dress it in a way where we can show it to our parents so we use words like cannibal becomes giant uh things like that but more importantly we end up uh cleansing ethnically cleansing
[07:34] shame cleansing all of our history whitewashing it gosh you can't even use white wash in this case it's it's and you don't want to use blackwash it's it's more like syruping it yeah yeah you're you're just covering it in syrup
[07:47] and you're you're explaining why uh why something needs to be uh removed be and and insisting that it's wrong even though the truth is right there even uh a few years ago in 2017 they
[08:03] just uncovered this uh genetic tie between the the northern tribes of of then Brazil to this island that Columbus was speaking about which means that the the cannibalism that that was being spoken about is absolutely true and if
[08:17] you're looking on the screen right now I I I'm showing you a piece of Crockery a Mesoamerican Crockery and this has a specific name I do not know that name an Aztec or Michin
[08:31] or no no word and you guys already make fun of me enough as I as I try and say the words I'm going to say so but the point of this slide is to show you that Not only was cannibalism alive and well
[08:43] but there was a tupperware brand specifically made for holding Hearts livers lungs all the different pieces and these same vessels of course occurred in Egypt but it was part of
[08:56] analing ritual so this Con connection to us and our body is is uh and cannibalism itself as I've been arguing for a long time here on this channel and within my work that the rise out of slavery uh is
[09:10] going to have a rung that has the word cannibal in it and that as we gain our our sense of self-worth uh so too do we do we start to extract that worth through uh labor
[09:24] through um fraud through theft through taxation through convincing people to go to war through playing a flute through telling them that there's a dangerous uh asteroid crashing down to
[09:38] convincing everyone to shove a needle into their skin subcutaneously and insert something where the insert is made uh completely blank that has no information at all and
[09:53] that you're looking at the beautiful beautiful Melting Pot of what it takes to be a psychology of Osiris the the man that has been splintered into 13.7 trillion cells and you and I are one of
[10:07] those so let's be honest with ourselves about where we came from what we did and how we got there some of you might find this episode a little bit itchy a little bit scratchy because the Christianity thing is you're going to feel like uh
[10:21] it's a little bit critical but I hope you'll see that actually back then this is actually more going to be critical of um um the Roman cult and its desperate attempt to free itself from the religio
[10:35] this is a real word from the uh uh societal requirements that they show religious faith in public and that ultimately this is what what caused Christianity to birth if we get there so
[10:50] to get there let's start really really un whitewashing the history that we know and the original version of Snow White the wicked Queen eats what she believes
[11:01] to be the lungs and liver of a tiny girl and that the original fa of this story is in fact a story of cannibalism itself and over time we find this
[11:14] unacceptable and so we stop accepting it and it's quite simple once we do that so we pull out of these situations and we still have to find a way to change the story this is why I say if you look back in history
[11:29] and look for the largest lump the largest bit of Shame the largest bit of prejudicial uh social uh Stigmata you're always going to find a deeper truth I I point you all to the
[11:44] very meaning of the word which is a burning fire sacrificial fire is the word for Holocaust itself and so even in our own recent history have we been trying
[11:59] desperately to explain why psychologically we feel inclined to do something yet intellectually we refuse to admit that we would ever ever go there and Snow White is just one of those
[12:11] examples Hansel and gredle escaped the being devoured by a hag and ran away and the truth of the fact is that hag was probably living in their own Hamlet that
[12:22] that hag was probably their neighbor and that hag probably was losing a bit of their own psychology and Times of strife and would slip into this thean we'll
[12:36] we'll get to that word in a second this thean mindset where one would reduce themselves to being feral uh as in as in the falness of a cat right that you would reduce yourself down to to
[12:52] becoming that creature again and stepping into full animism by the way in this same process and that that process you might you might eat a few kids you you might eat a few kids and you're
[13:04] going to wake up the next morning in the gutter you're going to wonder what happened and you're going to look at your clothes and they're going to be covered with blood you're going to go my God
[13:18] someone ate these children and it wasn't me you're not going to be able to admit that are you [ __ ] insane you're not going to admit that and you're going to blame it on a witch you're going to create some sort of extraterrestrial
[13:30] witch that exists uh outside of you and that that's going to be the cause of that and that built into the psyche of the entire Society is going to be this wonderful story about about that's what happened right that that's what happened
[13:45] yeah kids like goats exactly I think that's how you pronounce that exactly just like goats uh this brings us to lamia lamia oh lamia lamia let down your snake
[13:59] let me growl up your snake down from your tower for it is high Romeo lamia was a certain woman who shines at night or herodias the Mistress of the night they called her and that she was the one
[14:12] who would summon these cannibal assemblies for various Banquets and so during the day she was considered a a woman of peace and love and at night she
[14:24] would uh turn into this creature and uh become gluttonous and and devouring and I I uh whoops I I am
[14:38] guilty of this I don't need children but oh my God I I got I got uh I got cookies in the mail yesterday and I I became L
[14:51] and I I I it happens it happens to the best of us I'm not even the best of us and it happens to me it's a tough tough tough thing let me tell you it is hard oh wow lamb is a very popular name in
[15:05] North Africa look at that so this this uh this creature is I think just acting out our psychic kind of how we were feeling right like what we meaning the
[15:20] the psyche back then right it was kind of like trying to understand and fit as to as to uh how do we explain this how can I be a mild-mannered mother by day and a in a serpent Cannibal by
[15:35] Night superhero you're going to need multiple personalities right it it's it's it's all there um The Festus I'm going to guess that's how you pronounce this
[15:48] thastus eats his own children you guys heard of this thastus eats his own children and uh later on he was asked what he thought and he said they were good kids do do
[16:04] you get it that's a that's a James True joke I need a I need a I got I think I got a clap no that doesn't work on this thing but yeah I need like a B I need to work on that I want to put that on my list but yeah
[16:17] thius uh was a uh yeah certainly Kronos but uh thius um was the brother and king of myia uh uh I'm sorry theis is brother and king of isia was named Atrius and
[16:32] Atrius vowed to sacrifice his best lamb to Artemis okay so he goes searching through his flock and AR arus discovers that he's got a golden lamb and he's like oh my
[16:45] god I've Got a Golden Lamb so he gives the Golden Lamb to his wife and he's like hey erope arope ero erop I bet it's aope hey arope I'm going to give you this Golden Lamb I want you to hide hi
[16:59] it from the goddess I don't want to sacrifice this are you kidding this is a Golden Lamb I don't want to do that right so th just does that she gave it to her and guess what the uh
[17:10] Atrius gives his wife aopa this this lamb and you know what she does that [ __ ] gives it to her secret lover her husband's brother she gives it
[17:26] to her brother-in-law she's like Hey You and I we sleep together I got a Golden Lamb hey let's have sex here's a Golden Lamb oh I love you oh I love you too yeah hey I got something oh what'd you get me I got you gold lamb oh my God you got me gold lamb I've never had gold
[17:41] lamb I know right well where'd you get it it doesn't matter oh come on where'd you get it I stole it from your from your brother right so fistus I just want to point out at this point thus is
[17:54] completely innocent the dud not only is thus innocent Duke got freaking corn swoggled by uh little cuck action you know he's got uh this is not a good lady that's all I'm saying yeah some of you
[18:07] might be going hey she has her reasons right she's going through life we all only get where most of us think that we only I don't know how many I think we only get one chance personally I don't mind you thinking reincarnation but I'm
[18:20] saying I only get one chance to do this what I'm doing so they only get one chance you know she's probably got her reasons right so I don't even mean to demonize her but come on although you
[18:32] know to be fair her husband adus he's already lying to to the gods about a Golden Lamb so he's he's got a golden lamb and all right this just hit me guys Pro
[18:46] tip if you were a shepherd and you come out one day and you notice that one this I don't know why it took so long for me to realize this this is why I'm here God I'm slow guys if you walk out and and your
[19:00] flock suddenly has a Golden Lamb I want you to the first guess I want you to make is God I think God is is testing me don't don't give the lamb to your
[19:13] your significant other's sibling all right as like a a love gift it that doesn't even belong to you it's already been kind of ruined it's you get it this
[19:27] is this is this is tough right this is the this is a this a tough one this helloo real talk so uh let's get back to work here right so
[19:41] thus uh she gives it to her lover thus and thus uh ends up tricking his own brother into getting the lamb now check it out Atrius th's
[19:56] brother let me read it to you I think it'll you'll you'll understand it better she gave it to her lover thius who then convinced Atrius to agree that whoever had the lamb should be
[20:07] king thus produced the lamb and claimed the throne right so basically uh he tricked his own brother so his brother tricked him he tricked his own brother she's in the middle major
[20:20] triangulation here right major triangulation all right so Atrius then then learned of thius and iopus is adultery and plotted Revenge okay so he
[20:35] killed th's sons and cooked them in a pot and he saved their hands and their heads and he served his brother his own children and then taunted him with his head with their hands and their heads
[20:49] this this this Feast is called a thian feast and so you can imagine that the person that's eating it uh at least in the mythology here isn't supposed to know that they're eating
[21:02] it uh but there's an important part of this story because not only do they not know but thius uh in most versions of the story it is revealed to him that that he is eating his
[21:15] children and he can't stop he can't stop he enters remember lamea lamea he enters into a State a
[21:31] uh a hunger State a gluttony I'm sorry a state of gluttony right he enters into this state of gluttony and that state of gluttony uh overtakes his personality and the lamia that we just talked about slips
[21:47] out so this this phrase thian Feast came from this time you know 200 BC something like that uh all the way up to 180 somewhere around there these
[22:00] these terms are being thrown around and used and and you know they're they're going to stick if they're real if if no one is a cannibal if no one slips into gluttony and you know
[22:14] that Rome had a I'm not even going to say a problem a lot of Rome people would enter into these gluttonous States for days this is why every Moon they would have a
[22:26] festival Rome was smart because Rome knew there's no way that we can enforce the psyche of this herd is too powerful we cannot enforce them into a
[22:42] position we have to manage what we have we have to create a politic so the first politic was we needed everyone to wear clothes the second politic was we need
[22:54] everyone to not kill each other or at least just don't do it out in the open was kind of their deal it's like do you have to do it in the open and and don't kill anyone whose dress is
[23:07] nice this really was like the birth of all this then you come now you've birthed the idea of a citizenship right from citizenship you you have a ladder and seriously it's like one of the most brilliant inventions ever made Rome is
[23:21] still is proud of Rome I think it's a a good thing happy Good Friday all uh Nate thank you for for doing a good job in there appreciate that uh I hope you're doing well um so this
[23:36] this thian look it's all over the place right of course Kronos someone mentioned that in chat excellent point but if you really considered that this John the Baptist here's John the Baptist April 15th by the way is typically what we
[23:52] call John the Baptist day tax day tax day and that the the story you bring me the head of John the Baptist and uh herod's wife just obsessed over this why would herod's
[24:07] wife obsess over this because she was a cannibal I don't I don't need you guys to like please don't record this as James now thinks all these people are cannibal okay I want you to to Dawn the Hat of this
[24:23] could have been a thing and I just want you to just look through the scope of history for a little bit I I don't think that that it was like super rampant or prevalent I think that it was definitely something that was
[24:37] happening enough to where people were worrying about it and the entire you know the word gluttony itself is really just a lowered State of Consciousness and that you could picture
[24:50] how that lowered State of Consciousness would would kind of slip you into all kinds of weird stuff and when you consider the religious aspects of this the ritualistic aspects of this herod's wife
[25:04] herod's herod's wife's husband right Herod liked to kill children he had a thing for killing kids
[25:17] and there is a uh lot to do with the blood of this too there's a technology to this uh there's a ritual uh murder of a young boy that's recounted in these times it features the youth's heart being removed from his
[25:33] body the heart is sprinkled with barley spped in oil and subsequently served out to the participants of the initiation right those present swear an oath eat the heart drink the blood and finally engaged in sexual intercourse with one
[25:46] another okay so so can you picture what's what's happening the the psyche is changing into a lowered state
[25:59] and that's going to give you cannibalism pedophilia uh drunken debauchery uh rape all that stuff not only that usually during these times anything evil
[26:14] that people wanted to do break contracts commit arson thiefs Rob kill that's when you do it it's kind of like a uh uh it's not kind of it's it it
[26:29] today we look at it in culture as oh the full Moon's here it must be uh the the the time when all the crazies came out but back then it was more of like the
[26:40] crazies are always out I wonder if we can make people kind of focus their crazy [ __ ] on the full moon and so it became a a a safety light it became like
[26:54] a street light the full moon did but in the opposite way and so you you had a a respit between these things you knew where you could exist in the streets based on where these street lights were and more
[27:08] importantly based on where they weren't if you know what I'm saying so it gave you a navigatable in navigatable way of living in the city um and it did that really thanks to the religio uh the

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
27:21] politic of Rome keep in mind Rome Rome built a a giant building specifically for we want you to worship anything you want we just asking that you Worship in public so we can verify that you're not a feral
[27:36] cannibal that really was the only point it was the it was Judaism and Christianity were trying to privatize religion and this was such a a brutally
[27:50] unique concept it was breaking every social Rule and more importantly it was vacating the entire purpose of why Rome thought that they needed religion if you're going to privatize this and bring
[28:04] it into your house how are we going to instill order because there are people out there that you're going to want to have to show up here to make a sacrifice every day because if you don't they will
[28:20] take over the city that's really what did it and as long as we can all agree on this this is the closest thing that we can all come to to establishing some order what what what did what did we just show we just show that the first
[28:35] taxes were alms the very first taxes were sacrifices for the gods and back then you got to pick which God your taxes went to you did you got to pick which
[28:49] Temple goddess your taxes go to and I use taxes Loosely here because I think most of it was Prana if you can imagine that that if if you're
[29:00] uh you know uh lrees the badass and you know you took out a few Giants and you look really good in a kilt I mean in a in a in a toga and
[29:15] you're cruising through the streets and you suddenly change from from the the the cult of the Sacred elbow to The Cult of the let's slice our genitals people are going to notice that and when you
[29:28] when you start to religio your efforts into a different gang right that that becomes a a tangible currency and so Rome wanted to control that currency because Rome
[29:42] wanted a city they wanted uh a city they wanted something and they were going to get it and they did and so it's the Cults of
[29:54] Rome that tend to be forgotten the intensity of of the Jewish cult which throughout this stream I'm going to be referring to as a genital cult I just have to do that because it wasn't Judaism
[30:07] yet the birth of Judaism the birth of Christianity came out of the the sarcophagus of Judaism and that sarcophagus was the face plate inside a genital cult and that genital cult was the only
[30:23] way that you could instill privacy inside a crowded city of Rome be the only way that you could in install secrecy and the moment you install secrecy you create paranoia all around you and the moment you create paranoia you create Intrigue and the moment you create Intrigue you now have a magnet
[30:37] that sucks people in that says I want more I want more in the Midnight Hour right and so you you end up with this with this the more secret you get the more people uh will flock into your
[30:51] religion they want to know what you have what are you cooking in there like well we put our Barrel on we put our penis on a barrel and we cut the end of it off and the rest of us watch and we don't
[31:04] cry and when we do that everyone buys you a beer and boom now you're in a cult now you're in a cult so you you go through this
[31:16] process this is tentalus Tantalus the word t uh tantalized Right comes from this guy tentalus or Tantalus however you want to say it let's let's we'll go with Tantalus Tantalus raw man noodles that's
[31:31] funny Heather oh that's funny raw man that's funny that's that's good that's good okay uh uh we'll get to that Robert uh
[31:48] Tantalus served served the chopped up remains of his son Bops to the Gods in order to test their omniscience
[31:58] and so wow right so first of all pelops is the same name as the thesis's father by the way and I didn't have time to wait to find some
[32:14] other Scholars say wait these are are these the same guy is this the same guy or not in mythology because if they are then it simply means that tanelus chose to participate in cannibalism because his father accidentally participated in
[32:26] cannibalism get it so so uh tanelus chose to chose to take his son and say these gods they don't know at all they've invited me to dinner and I'm going to chop up my son and I'm going to
[32:40] serve it to them but they do know all and they're like I'm not eating your dead son that's crazy and so he was stopped and tanelus was tortured long long time uh he's stretch between the where he's
[32:59] constantly reaching for for fruit and as soon as he reaches for it it stretches out from his hands and then there's water and he's thirsty and when he leans down to drink it it drains instantly so he's constantly going through he's having a rough time he's having a rough
[33:14] time you know and something really interesting I found out yesterday about about old tanelus here big big sidebar here but uh so so there's one person that actually
[33:27] did eat tanis's children and his name's demer or her name is deer and the reason given for why Deer uh did choose to heat tanis's children is because deer was worried
[33:44] that prapan had been kidnapped and this oh man guys this just opens this whole Hades myth that we've been talking about even more think about it this Demeter's in love
[34:04] with pany pranie watches demeer go to a cannibal feast and demer chooses to
[34:16] eat pranie leaves pranie says [ __ ] this I don't want to be here where does she go she goes to the underworld with Hades she f falls in love with Hades and goes to the underworld refuses to eat
[34:31] the cannibalistic meal goes to the underworld with Hades and eats pomegranate seeds instead did you hear that pomegranate seeds
[34:44] instead so even the the springtime itself brought about the expungement of cannibalism hear me out hear me out because the cult of Isis
[34:58] so to set this up I need you to know that I think that because the Egyptians had a word for blue before anyone else they were way way more lit consciously than anyone
[35:11] else and because of that they just simply were ahead of the curve it's not that they were right they were just simply ahead of a curve we'll just put it that way and that's why so much of our religion just copying theirs including the Easter egg which is just the sarcophagus right not just it's the
[35:26] sarcophagus um Egypt doesn't actually have a lot of stories of them worried about their own people eating each other that's not a common thing but but Christians
[35:42] did Rome did barbarians did plyy the younger um was quoted he was reporting to Emperor Tran he was basically in Turkey which is funny as hell because we're talking about can ISM but he was
[35:58] he was visiting turkey and when he was in Turkey he took the time to write the Christians here only take food of an ordinary harmless kind and what he was doing was actually pleading with Trey Jan he actually was pleading with him
[36:12] he's like hey Trey Jan these guys are not cannibals it's okay these guys are not cannibals it's okay and and to prove that trean what does Tran say I'll read it to you traan says uh he say some other stuff I took
[36:26] out at the beginning just to get you the point but says he's kind of longwinded I'll do a different voice they are not to be sought out if they are denounced and proved guilty they to be punished with this
[36:38] reservation now hear this this is not hating a Christian listen to this that whoever denies that he is a Christian and really proves it that is by worshiping our Gods even though he was Under Suspicion in the past shall obtain
[36:52] pardon through repentance but anonymously posted accus ations ought to have no place in our persecution for this is both a dangerous kind of precedent and out of keeping with the spirit of our age Tran is
[37:06] exercising rationalism in his uh hunting of Christianity and he's he's begging everyone listen because if you understand in through today's scope
[37:20] through a very shallow shallow compassion you would look at this and say he was trying to religiously persecute people by forcing them to worship His Gods but that's not what he says he says worship Gods our Gods meant the
[37:34] pantheon every single God you could imagine it was it was the genital cult that said you can't count Our God because our God's name is secret and
[37:47] we're not going to [ __ ] tell you what his name is so they're at the Tran's at the pantheon I mean not him but they're they're there like we're making this building what's we put here for you hey hey General cult you guys want us to put
[38:00] your God's no we will never put our God's name in your building why not because that's blasphemy that's kind of rude no it's not rude your guys are all evil Our God's the only one and we're going to go cut our genitals yay and and
[38:14] and Rome's like well that's that's different and it was this was very different you realize that the Jews the Christians all they had to do was simply
[38:27] say This Is Our God Pantheon would be like hey we have a prime spot for you oh genital Cutters look at you guys cutting your generals over there of course you got a spot over here come on sit down
[38:41] right pick a color so you're you're you're watching a desperate uh governmental psychological movement that's just simply trying to hold things together does that make sense there was a flesh test Believe It
[38:57] or Not Cicero senica plutar and valerious Maximus all had this flesh test they were uh telling telling each other if you want to know if someone can be a citizen of Rome or if someone's
[39:10] safe or if someone is is ready then the simple question is is would they eat human flesh and the answer to that question the ethical answer to that hypothetical question was all it took it was a truth serum back
[39:25] then and and it shows you that if you're sitting there worried about whether or not someone's going to eat someone else you you've got a pretty low bar this is not no shirt no shoes no service this is
[39:38] like no eat people no service okay so you've really really lowered yourself down to this like least common denominator and when you realize just how much you had to lower yourself down
[39:52] to to like try and build a civilization from this I think it starts to shed more light into uh what it took and why religio that word invented by cisero by
[40:04] the way uh even even came to be this was the only way the only field test that they had to know whether or not you were civilized as I said before Egypt has no
[40:16] history of accusing each other oh the upper kingdoms a bunch of cannibals well the lower kingdoms uh really cannibals well the upper kingdoms more cannibals than that that didn't happen the only mention uh in like
[40:32] Egyptian technically it's not even technically Egyptian would would be uh in in in Alexandria during the helenistic cleansing uh sort of a uh guys we're going to hide all mentions of
[40:46] cannibalism anything that makes us ashamed of anything we've ever done is going to be expunged from our records and it was during that period that accusations of cannibalism were coming out of Egypt it's one of the few
[40:59] times that that so even then it really wasn't Egypt itself it's just simply those were some of the places where the writings were still uh we were still able to to find them one of which came
[41:10] from uh wait minute I'm got to skip there oh no I thought I okay uh uh never mind I had another slide for you but but it's gone I get why I I cut
[41:25] it cut it loose so um this so people in Egypt a little bit more civilized cannibalism quite simply is not a problem one of the reasons why is because of the cult of
[41:39] Isis the cult of Isis uh was attempting to stop cannibalism and their hymns that that they spoke about that said oh Cult of Isis we are here to stop people from eating each other this isn't really it
[41:54] but it's like they had these things and and and and Isis was spreading the uh the nosis of farming and agriculture as an attempt to get people can you stop eating each other it's like well what do we do it's like here have
[42:07] some corn have some grain have some barley grow [ __ ] stop being so lazy things like that right so um it leads us
[42:23] to how how is the social uh what does Christianity look like in the social microscope this guy Bart wag makers uh wrote a journal article
[42:41] interesting study incest in infanticide and cannibalism anti-christian imputations in the Roman Empire and he I'm sorry to say he he's also apolog an an a a cannibalistic
[42:56] apologetic I'll say he's I think suppressing the same way the Columbus writers do the same way even Mesoamerican archaeologists do now when they're like no we didn't eat people that was an
[43:07] exaggeration it wasn't 80,000 it was 7 8,9 9 96 if you weren't so racist you wouldn't have exaggerated you know stuff like that and so it's like dude we were we were eating people just get over it can
[43:24] we just get over it can we just get over it can we come on anyway uh Bart here uh brings up some good points though one of which is the kiss of peace that a on the
[43:37] street in your genital cult so you got a genital cult then you got a halfa genital cult halfa genital Cults is like dude we we don't want to be that Jewish can we can we be less genital culty can we can we can we take things less seriously well what do you mean first of
[43:52] all your moon is way too hard I can't track that that's you're asking me to wake up every day and like do some math I'm not doing that can can't we just put a stick in the ground and I just use like a solar calendar and the Jews are like oh God you guys are lazy it's like
[44:06] yeah I know but look we cut our genitals you kind of owe us so boom that's how Christianity is form I just told you but uh on the cult in the general cult around the streets the way you talk to each other the way you you you you would usually meet in private keep in mind
[44:21] that most Christians were typically their churches were probably at night I mean think about it you're going You're trying to privatize religion which means you're taking a worship into your own house and you're maybe inviting a few friends over and so the secret society
[44:33] is born oh secret society's born out of Christianity born from the same place and one of the uh rituals they had was they believed in brotherly sisterly love and the kiss they would kiss each other
[44:47] on the cheek to it's a symbol of equality and this this uh according to Bart is arguing this was used to misconstrue that they were homosexuals and cannibals somehow but that's that's
[45:01] I don't think that's it I think Bart's coming from that time where rituals weren't so invigorating guys I I remind you it's been cleansed from YouTube trust me I've tried to find it there is
[45:12] a reenactment of a like phrase for phrase step for step ancient Greek ritual and it's features young younger children although these were probably of age enough to do this for video I don't
[45:27] even know how that works but they're stroking a giant wooden phus in a in a field at night and they're and and we look at it through the cleansing eye of like like you're going to Episcopal Church service and an acolytes lighting C uh candles but that's not what was
[45:41] happening back then that same same thing with the story of of John the Baptist right and how if you want to be born again people are going to hold you under the [ __ ] water until you drowned and that that would dilate the piss out of you you want to see God it's not going
[45:56] to be sprinkled water on your foreheads my friends you living in the time of lions tigers om my you're living in that rough rough time you're going to need something that's even rougher to shake you wake you and bake you right to
[46:09] change you on a deeper level and so a near-death experience is going to be the way to get that you know what else is going to get that cutting your genitals in public to join a gang that is definitely going to get it can you see
[46:22] how this works so in a lot of ways pagan ISM became the 50s and Christianity and Judaism was cocaine in the 80s man it was the 70s it was this this y'all we're going a
[46:37] different direction here we're trying something different and and this this uh this kiss of
[46:50] peace is kind of showing you the how much ethnic cleansing that we have to to do to our own to our own history Judas by the
[47:03] way right you think about Judas uh goes into the garden and shows the Romans um hey uh I'm going to show you which one is the guy and I'm going to use the very
[47:16] uh secret society kiss that that that we give each other to Showcase that view and and when you look at the Betrayal of that it really uh it's easy to fall for the the falsity that Jesus
[47:30] was betrayed it's the same same trick you might fall for to think that Osiris chose to put himself in the box right it's uh um yeah I know crows corn I don't know what it is with with people you know they're like oh look a free
[47:44] show we must find something some way to destroy this they're just the fabric of society is being hurt from this guy talking I must St yeah anyway thanks Nate uh
[47:57] um so another uh remnant of this is Bania this takes back to 200 BC and Rome's trying to say well the the Greeks brought it in and they did but you know
[48:11] it's not like you guys are you know you guys are practicing it same kind of deal you're you're meeting for for a few weeks and you have the ability suddenly to just just let your hair
[48:25] down I mean let your hair down right I mean like let your hair down like let your hair down and eat some kids uh let your hair down and uh neither did they okay
[48:39] here such s such imputations this is from Bart's Bart's article page 344 uh held in the woods outside the city people danced ecstatically taking wine and meals as well furthermore the sources suggest that during the bakan Alan orgies men and women adults and
[48:55] children un shamly entered into sexual intercourse with one another neither did they shrink from committing perjury forging seals Testaments and judicial evidence okay poisoning or murdering
[49:07] individuals in secret so this is a cult it's pretty big they it uh uh I've read numbers in the thousands that bonellia was uh had had as many as like a thousand thousands of members and so
[49:22] if you could start to picture how that this would be like the Crips and the Bloods or or the MS13 or whatever you're just looking at a a crime gang that's allowing itself to to get away with things to commit sin and get away with
[49:35] things using Force which is I'm getting ready to to get to that it's uh um all right so before we get to that I probably should have had this earlier
[49:48] but I want you to I want you to start to I'm hoping you're going to start to question well James how can you like when you think about sacrifice isn't a sacrifice you're like pouring
[50:03] beer over your buddy tu's grave right like you're why beer because you like beer and so instead of drinking the beer you're pouring some of it out you're sacrificing
[50:16] it and I'd like I'd like you to to start to kind of ask yourself well why is it a Passover feast the passover's feast commemorates Israel's deliverance from slavery in
[50:32] Egypt they say on Passover Jews also celebrate the birth of Jewish Nation after being freed by God from captivity and they do this they don't do this by making a sacrifice they do this by
[50:45] eating and I'm I'm just asking you to do you do you think that there could be a a dis a difference between those two things between a sacrifice and a feast because I think I think there's a huge difference
[50:58] there I think it's bigger than we think I think we know how big it is but we're not really not really able to admit it this is heavy what I'm getting ready to say so the sacrificial lamb is typically
[51:14] chosen for various reasons we're going to get into some of those reasons why but but this I'm sure pronouncing this wrong but this Pasha lamb is what it's called and it's the lamb that sacrificed at the first Passover on the east of The
[51:26] Exodus from Egypt so it says the most momentous event in Jewish history and according to the story of the Passover the Jews marked their doorpost with the blood of lamb and this sign spared them from destruction right you know the
[51:41] story but I want you to think about the posal Lamb of Judaism itself Judaism wow they had
[51:52] a the entire country of Rome was at War with Jews you know that some of the most rebellious uh Wilderness gangs you could imagine that were
[52:06] effective at least we'll say the most effective rebellions anywhere Titus flavius called a messiah simply because he was effective in pulverizing or attempting
[52:20] to pulverize the this genital cult it was a genital cult then it wasn't n Jews it was a general cult then I don't know if this stream's going to make it I hope so that's I kept telling myself I wasn't
[52:34] going to use that but anyway I want you to consider how much it benefited the the initial cult the lunar
[52:51] cult to place the solar cult as its own sacrificial lamb I'm suggesting that Christianity itself was placed on the on the altar of
[53:08] sacrifice so that Rome would blame all of the Rebellion on this lighter version of the genital Cole keep in mind that the the
[53:23] the Christians are are they're not as intense and the mere fact that they're not as intense would instantly make them the scapegoat for the ones that are the 12 tribes of
[53:37] Israel 11 of them worked so well together they're like we love each other we have our own version of God I call my God this you call your God that all this stuff
[53:51] right and it it was it was only this one one one of 12 that said no our God is different because our God is actually above all your other gods it was just one and this is this is really the heart
[54:05] of the Rebellion so you can't go into a city that's built a giant monolithic building the first structure ever built out of concrete one of the most advanced thought thoughtful buildings you could ever imagine a Pantheon literally built
[54:20] for the harmony of religion and you've got one genital cult that's saying yeah but our Gods above all you guys and then it'd be blasphemy for us to put his name you can't even have his name A and B we're not going to put it inside

**ChatGPT:**
<p>I analyzed a portion of the transcript discussing the politicization of religion in ancient Rome, particularly focusing on the contrast between public and private worship. It highlights the attempt by Judaism and Christianity to privatize religion, which was seen as a threat to the social order and the perceived purpose of religion by Roman authorities. The transcript delves into the significance of sacrifice and taxation in ancient religious practices, including the selection of gods for offerings and the control of religious currency by Rome. Additionally, it explores the emergence of secrecy and paranoia in religious practices, leading to the formation of cults and secret societies. The analysis connects these historical dynamics to the development of Christianity and Judaism, framing them as responses to Roman governance and societal norms. The discussion also touches on accusations of cannibalism and other extreme behaviors within religious groups, and the role of sacrifice and feast in religious rituals, particularly in Judaism. Finally, it suggests a theory that Christianity was strategically positioned as a sacrificial lamb by Rome to divert blame for societal unrest onto a less intense religious faction.</p>

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
54:33] your your structure and so you end up kind of going well what the [ __ ] are these guys doing here and I think Rome does what they do they're like well you're not going to make it here you got to go get the [ __ ]
[54:46] out and and no the answer was no make us make us and now you know why there's like a sale on on temples down at Costco right cuz you buy one you take it home you unwrap it and it gets burnt down and
[55:01] gets leveled you go back to Costco you get another one you take it you unwrap it it gets burnt down right unless you have a sacrifice unless you have a scapegoat back to that question about
[55:15] Passover versus sacrifice remember it it is it I mean a a feast versus a sacrifice I would imagine that Pharaoh would would would would would ask if the
[55:28] sacrificial lamb is eaten is it really a sacrifice any Pagan would ask that so you didn't throw it in the fire you you cooked it and then you ate it
[55:42] uh isn't that just like a barbecue is Tabernacle just like a barbecue joint is it like Carolina Barbecue is it because I'm bringing you my favorite lamb that I raised
[55:57] and you're you're just cooking it we're eating it with that why is this a sacrifice it's no it's a Passover feast okay so if it's a feast why what's going
[56:10] on what's going on and and modern Jews will tell you well it's because there's you know there not a temple once the Temple's there then we'll we'll restore the feast until then we have a lamb bone you know there's there's a there's a tradition to this there's a lot of different thoughts this is why I love
[56:25] Judaism I fre and love Jud is by the way I'm not just saying that for the algorithm I love it because those [ __ ] write down everything they don't care they write down everything and when you look at the
[56:38] transaction um of of what's Happening you're looking at a different kind of math the Pagan would say is if if the sacrificial lamb is eaten is it really sacrifice the Pagan would say if nothing was
[56:51] sacrificed then does the exchange even happen you know uh if if a sacrifice if something dies for our sins and we eat it did it die for our sins or did it die for our
[57:11] ability to be hungry do you understand so does that muck it up this is my question I think it does I think that that if you end up
[57:27] eating that it doesn't actually I don't know how you separate that that means that Tyson's is the most religious frozen food corporation in the world because they sacrifice more
[57:40] chickens than anyone else does and so if anyone would have the favor of the Gods it would be Tyson right do do you see the thought I I'm
[57:52] not asking you to to weigh or even have a certain I I just want you to think I don't even want you to think I just hope you're enjoying it happy Good Friday good to see everybody it makes me think though it makes me think that that we almost want
[58:09] to negate the sacrifice because we want to keep doing it we we do not want to be forgiven because the moment that we we are forgiven for this we have to stop doing it and we don't want to stop doing it so we're going to we're going to say
[58:23] hey let's go the sacrifice what's the sacrifice for us so we can stop being cannibals oh okay what time is it at it's at 8:00 okay well is there going to be food there yeah there's going to be food there so you're like great let's go and you go and what happens you slip
[58:37] into this uh metabolic state right it's a nice night Breeze is blowing look you're looking at your friend hey I could eat you right now what' you say nothing nothing having a
[58:53] great time let's go to the feast abon that was his name oh man I thought this this this slide was gone guys but the slide was right here the whole time yeah the cult of Isis launched the first great campaign
[59:08] to civilize the human world according to their own hymns one of the major aspects of that campaign was the abrogation of cannibalism by introducing a Agriculture and laws for social behavior The Cult of
[59:20] Isis was uh trying to bring civilization to humanity appan uh the speaker appion an Egyptian scholar during the helenistic alexandrian time spoke on Roman genital Cults would murder a
[59:36] non-member to eat their un trails and blood you actually would describe those stories and modern Scholars will say that didn't happen but the same modern Scholars will tell you that there weren't there weren't cannibals or that it was like a rare thing when actually
[59:50] was like a solid economy guys mesom America there the body parts there's like just dis distribution methods there's like if there's five people then there's this is how you divide it into five parts if there's three people if there's two people however many people
[01:00:04] took that captive they they they're entitled to certain cuts of meat of that and that those cuts of meat end up being a tabernacle you swear in Allegiance with other people by saying you and I are going to eat this guy named cliff
[01:00:18] today and it's going to be our Tabernacle that's what that word means or Covenant one of the other I'm sorry I don't want to look it up right now but one those actually means the best cut of meat and so you could see how these things were contracts I'm going to show you how they're contracts oh yeah just
[01:00:33] you wait I'm going to show you how they're right here boom blood liel I didn't know was the next slide but that was kind of cool Deuteronomy 21 I'm going to read you Deuteronomy 21 this is really
[01:00:46] important I need to get some like lightning sounds I'm going to actually take a little cup of coffee hey how's everybody doing we got uh oh if we had one more person we have the sacred number 108 but 107 is not bad it's great to zero
[01:01:00] buddy you know if Nate if you wouldn't have thrown out that guy we would have have 108 right now I'm just saying Nate I'm just saying you know I'm just kidding that guy distracted me he's I'm like dude I worked so hard on these slides why are you what are you
[01:01:19] doing okay blood liel Deuteronomy 21 if in the land that the Lord your God is assigning you to possess someone slain is found lying in the open the identity of the Slayer not being known your
[01:01:34] elders and magistrates shall go out and measure the distances from the corpse to the nearby towns the Elders of the Town nearest to the corpse shall then take a hepher which has never been worked which is
[01:01:46] never pulled in a yoke and the Elders of the Town shall bring the heer down to an Ever flowing W that that means like trench which is not till or swn there in the W or Ravine you know whichever they
[01:02:00] shall break the heer's neck basically in the water like like near this draining part part right they shall break the heer's neck the priest sons of Levi shall come forward for the Lord your God has chosen them to minister to him and
[01:02:14] to pronounce blessings in the name of the Lord and every lawsuit in case of assault is subject to their ruling then all the Elders of the Town nearest to the corpse shall wash their hands over the hepher whose neck was
[01:02:28] broken and they shall make this declaration here it comes our hands did not shed this Blood nor did our eyes see it done absolve O
[01:02:41] Lord your People Israel whom you redeemed and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent remain among your People Israel and they will be absolved of blood guilt thus you will remove from your mid
[01:02:56] guilt for blood of the innocent for you will be doing what is right in the sight of the Lord my God I hope someone caught what that means what that
[01:03:11] means this is telling you that if you find a dead body that you can cleanse the entire gang of its
[01:03:31] sin and all you have to do is murder haor haor the hepher that you need to take the Egyptian goddess one of their most
[01:03:45] precious goddess and murder that in the same spot where a dead person was and you were absolved of your sins my friends I know that it says in
[01:03:57] Deuteronomy 24 if you were whistling and you find someone has been slain out in the open and thouest are minding is thine own business th because
[01:04:11] thouest are innocent until proven guiltiest then all you have to do is Count Paces to the nearest town go to
[01:04:22] that town demand a heer have have a blood liel and now you're absolved and no one can legally bind you to that death which means if you kill someone
[01:04:36] because you entered into a gluttonous State all you got to do is drag them into the Ravine and if you're like one town better than the other you're going to drag the body to a different part of the Ravine and then you're going to walk into town you're going to repeat the
[01:04:52] entire process again because you were now absolved and the moment that this ritual happens your murder is no longer a murder it literally says absolve O Lord your People Israel Our
[01:05:05] Gang whom you redeemed Lord don't forget Lord you redeemed us so none of the guilt is ours in fact look here's an innocent blood was shed on top of this other blood which covers it up can you see the technology of the blood I you
[01:05:20] got to be able to see it you have yes mob tactics thank you marker 1113 you have to see that this this uh actually most of the slides have to be written uh Eve just so
[01:05:34] you know there are definitely some AI art in the slides but really what takes the slides the longest bit of time is actually writing them actually composing what is the idea I haven't figured out a way to make AI do that maybe I can maybe
[01:05:49] I can just have it make the slides next time but I kind of like this research I think it makes sense to do it this way um but we could stop AI slides too if that if that if that bothers people let me know I'm not saying it bothers you
[01:06:05] Eve but it's uh actually quite a lot of work I I think uh uh since we're since we're on the subject I um I think just
[01:06:17] today at least since 9: until 5 which is not a long day but then last night until 11:42 and then I played chess online cuz I couldn't wind down and that was from 10:00 in the morning and then that was
[01:06:31] actually a little bit in the day before but then most importantly maybe like half of these were actually done like months ago so what happens is is they they build up and then they percolate but they're still not condensed enough to actually put into a slide so it's
[01:06:45] it's like so much uh so much good thing yeah I'm not saying you're seeing that Eve I'm just more saying it's it's like man this stuff's uh it's so freaking cool though and when you at least for me
[01:06:58] it's cool because just by writing the slide I create a marker uh uh constellation right uh Ingram I'm getting off topic James get back to it so you if you're a general cult and you
[01:07:12] want to commit murder if you want to steal a car if you want to uh pillage something it's a very clear formula for how to get out of it and you start to realize why not just the general cult keep in mind the Greek cult we were back
[01:07:27] inelia right that that Greek cul the thousands of that Greek cul that was considered uh uh back inelia that one that was considered flat out just like a terrorist organization by Rome so there
[01:07:40] was like a a massive amount of trying to hunt those people down too and like uh really really take those guys out because because of [ __ ] like this because of [ __ ] like this you know and you talk about you're showing up to crime scene and there's
[01:07:55] there's like oh sorry you can't look here we're we're ritually murdering a cow to make everything better this a [ __ ] up world man you you can you see why Rome would
[01:08:07] be like this is a problem I can I I'm not saying they did everything right I'm just saying that I can see why they they think that was a problem right it actually brings to the uh someone uh take the right just says
[01:08:25] about Messiah and yeah it's it's actually brings you know Titus flavus was a messiah for putting down a Jewish Revolt there's a lot of Messiah I've done streams on this before so I won't I won't go into this but uh a messiah isn't necessarily someone that we're
[01:08:38] going to treat nice uh a messiah is going to be someone's going to deliver you something else which means that if you can if you can find someone that that will instrumentally clog up a hole with their now dead body that's going to
[01:08:52] be a messiah if that delivers you to the right place that's going to be a mess Messiah messiah's not necessarily someone that's going to be fine if anything the Messiah is pretty good sign things are not going to be going so well for you buddy going to have a rough time
[01:09:03] right Messiah speaking of Messiah Josiah not the same thing but Josiah provided all the lay people who were there a total of 30,000 lambs and goats for the Passover offering and 3,000 cattle all from the king's own
[01:09:18] possessions I'm just bringing this up because I want you to picture just the sheer Raw ceremony how big that was this is why this day is so
[01:09:32] important for for the genital cult it's it's the the beginning of all creation all of the Patriarchs are dead on that day I'm pretty sure I already told you that
[01:09:49] so let's have some fun because I I want you to ask the question was Jesus a moon child and to start us off on this thought process some you might be calling what's a moon child so I I I I think there's
[01:10:03] many definitions of this word but when I think Moon child I typically think a child that's been born in an astrological symbolic way in order to fulfill some sort of purpose and that purpose really doesn't have a lot to do
[01:10:17] with their identity I think in a lot of ways a moon child's kind of like a slave to the archetype Will Smith's son I think is Aiden Jada pinket I'm just trying to you know a
[01:10:30] famous actor's son is in many ways a moon child but you would take it further as as a an ancient magician especially in Rome especially in Egypt you would take this further that by by having a
[01:10:44] child born at a certain point or at a certain date that that child could be uh put into a position like a child actor and that that child actor would be destined for greatness or for d for things and that greatness means you're going to D in a Plato you know you're
[01:10:59] going to overdose on [ __ ] and you're going to die when you're 19 because the you're destined for greatness so that's what I mean by Destin for greatness so one of the first signs not the first but one of the first signs is the idea that the infant Christ was recognized
[01:11:13] and praised by Elders in the temple on his 40th Day if if an Egyptian if a dude named Joseph rushed his
[01:11:26] son out of herod's grasp and took him to Egypt and raised him in the temple and told his son that he was chosen as a moon
[01:11:39] child and if everyone else inside your cult agreed that your son was special as a moonchild then on the 40th Day very very important number for
[01:11:54] General cult 40 days that's the trying period the trial period for 40 days the infants Christ was recognized and praised by the Elder on the temple in his 40th Day and if he was
[01:12:07] a moon child if if everyone around him if the magic people around him the ones that were way into magic way into belief said we were going to have a child that's born for a specific purpose that purpose could be sacrifice it could be
[01:12:21] all kinds of things it fits more in with the climate of Rome than the traditional story that you've heard about Christianity if that makes sense it fits more hey Lena it fits more
[01:12:36] not less so let's go with this I want you to think just for a moment that Jesus comes from a magical family Egyptian magic see in blue totally lit maybe I know this is
[01:12:51] stret for some of you mute your ears if you're already having trouble with this stream and you don't hear anything else but maybe here it comes maybe Mary's Aphrodite Mr R says maybe the the Mary was forced into a Manger because they
[01:13:05] considered her an animal maybe they considered her an animal because she wasn't even quite uh quite standard that's a huge stretch don't even worry about it the point is is that consider this moonchild idea consider
[01:13:19] that the Egyptian temples were serious back then consider that the consider that you have a ritual that you wait all year for for the M pole and you know that on the M pole you are going to watch the most exotic dancing you've ever seen in your entire life and you
[01:13:34] were traveling thousands of miles to see a virgin on a tripod because these things dilate you which means the only kind of things that are going to work in this world are going to be things that dilate you and so being a moon child would be one of the things that would
[01:13:48] lit light Jesus up he would instantly feel I've been destined as Jonah I've been destined to go into the belly of the whale and to uh fulfill a destiny
[01:14:00] that's been set Before Me by by others one of which is is the whole uh uh prophecy she fulfills a prophecy I think that Moses is harder to
[01:14:15] say I I think Moses would be a moonchild however Moses also um would predate these things Moses I don't think was
[01:14:28] uh a person like you and I think if that makes sense we can do so much more about Moses though I I I I love the idea of that
[01:14:41] so so Jesus as a moon child suddenly this makes a lot of sense that that pilat asked the crowd hey what should we do
[01:14:53] with Jesus should we should we crucify am should should we Let Jesus go or should we let barabus go and what is that the story of that's the scapegoat there's
[01:15:08] Passover scapegoat what happens Two Goats enter one goat leaves two goats enter one goat leaves two goats Jesus
[01:15:21] barabus one gets crucified one leaves one is sent to hold all the sins for everyone one is sent to leave that's what the scapegoat does that your job as the scapegoat is we're going to anoint you with all of our sins and then we're going to kill you and we're going to
[01:15:36] feel better and it's the exact same thing that happens if we find a dead guy in the ditch same ritual same bad time same bad channel right so this this is
[01:15:53] moonchild what if Jesus was born to be a sacrificial lamb I don't think it's fair to say well that's crazy if any of you said that if you're still watching you probably don't think it's crazy but just in case
[01:16:08] someone just turned this on you're all like normal you know uh God bless you for being here um Pharaoh's in this time maybe a little bit earlier but still pharaohs during
[01:16:21] this day were ritualistically murdered on on purpose like in order to sustain the land them and their priests agreed that there was going to be a night where the pharaoh's murdered he actually picked the
[01:16:35] Knight do you do you realize how [ __ ] committed you are to being Pharaoh when you pick the Knight and they stopped that hey pharaohs are like H what if we don't do it this year or I just found a reason why we can't do it this year there's I I
[01:16:50] hired this special astrologer to come in from out of town and he told me that this time we shouldn't do that like you know all that stuff is happening but if you think about that especially when people when the psychology is closer to cannibalism and slavery and serfdom I
[01:17:05] think the idea that you would be born as a sacrificial lamb is just much more normalized it's so much more normalized at that point okay I I'm I'm going to stop for a sec to say take the ride makes a really good
[01:17:22] point which is this is what I mean by I don't I think people understood how intense this was during Passover this this wasn't just you go to you go to Costco and you buy a lamb this lamb has to be your
[01:17:35] lamb this lamb is your lamb this lamb is my lamb to the new this is an important this lamb was made for you and me and you
[01:17:49] you it's special to you and imagine all that happening on a singular day tax day same thing scapegoat Moon child it wouldn't be a moonchild if
[01:18:04] Jesus didn't agree which is what makes this so freaking fascinating this is why I Think Jesus is a badass I think he's a badass because of this as I said before to anoint is uh an
[01:18:18] old factory contract you're you're pouring the sacred smell of something you're assigning you are the Passover sacri rice Isaac you were the Passover sacrifice uh Jesus you were the Passover sacrifice goat named
[01:18:32] Charlie and that you're anointing them as the vessel of forgiveness you will hold the Forgiveness that all of us will bestow and we will we will get that from you by extracting your blood out of Innocence so you have to be innocent when you bleed please be innocent and
[01:18:46] we've talked about this before but uh a lion might have a better chance of killing making an innocent kill than say a pack of hyena uh I'm not saying all the time but it's just the the clean kill is going to be the one that that
[01:19:01] extrapolates the less amount of cortisol in the uh in in the blood so the innocent blood is easy to tell it's easy to determine even the smell of it the primary uh purpose um of anointing also was to declare something
[01:19:15] holy and and declare something holy kind of means just getting ready to die doesn't necessarily mean oh this means you're safe for life no no no that's not how it works kind of like the albino in Tanzania does not mean you think oh everyone loves an albino yeah they do

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:19:29] but they don't love you like that they like they want to sell your fingers on eBay it's that kind of thing so you've been anointed you've been set for this is a sacrificial dude now his up this fascinating plant that's used in both these things you're about
[01:19:43] to see uh also in Psalm 51 though but it's just this one of the uhh principles used to torture Christ the hups dipped in vinegar and sponge and and taken up to
[01:19:55] his lip and he refuses a drink it's the bitterness of it um this hsip is used in a couple of different things we'll see in a second so as to is the frankincense is literally the stabbing the piercing
[01:20:09] of the skin of a tree and that this tree uh suffers and that the gum of this myrr uh forms this resin this is the myrr actually but but like frankincense these things are considered uh sacred because
[01:20:25] uh the sacrifice that suffers on so that we can burn it later so now I'm going to bring up a weird idea not that we haven't done that right
[01:20:45] um what if in Egypt there was a can you remember the people of shazu remember this from previous stream I showed you that uh The Cult of Yahweh came out of the people of shazu and the people of shazu were a Wandering
[01:21:00] slave cult and why were they wandering because they didn't have a master why did they not have a master because they rebelled and the idea of well wait a minute what if Pharaoh kicked him out what if the Exodus in Egypt wasn't uh
[01:21:14] wasn't quite the story that we've been told what if the fact that the pyramids aren't mentioned in the Bible is a huge clue about this right and so I want I want you to consider the idea aidea that did a
[01:21:27] strike I'm talking about a worker strike did a worker strike um set to Defan the sacred animal of Egypt caused the pharaoh to expunge
[01:21:39] them you guys have know my my last book Arab bathat talks about the different different Ram Gods uh goat Gods this this figure in fact uh luor is lined
[01:21:53] with just you know an Avenue I think it's called The Avenue of of of lambs or something like that but of rams I mean this sacred uh
[01:22:07] animal and that the reason so Passover for for the general cult is associated to its SAR escape from Egypt and and and that's fine but what actually made them Escape but the story is is that we we
[01:22:23] you'll see but you know the blood put above the door then the Holy Ghost canes by but but what actually is happening is is that there's a curse a 10 a 10day long curse and I want you to Picture This is like a union curse it's like a
[01:22:37] curse set out by a union by a gang the gang decides we're going to collectively curse the entire city and if you were actively involved
[01:22:51] in a curse you would actively do things to make the curse look real it would be part of your job and so I'm suggesting to you that this genital cult the same way they use blood liel to say this Mur uh guy that we murdered is innocent
[01:23:05] because we killed a heer on top of him that that they would that they would say that a plag upon you Pharaoh because you're not you're not you're not succumbing to us the rebellious slaves the ones that had the name
[01:23:19] rebellious slaves before we even got here can you see how this makes sense what happens with the hsip right they're in Egypt and you're told take a bunch of hup dip it in the blood in the Basin and
[01:23:38] put some of the blood on top and both sides of your door frame says Exodus 121 12:21 and so that blood comes from the lamb right that's the Passover Lamb on the left and then on the right John 19:29 a Jar full of sour wine was
[01:23:57] standing there so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hsip and held it up to his mouth to Jesus's mouth so both sacrifices are being touched graced with Hub very pungent
[01:24:10] strong strong old factory dilational thing and so there's like this curse this Union curse think about it is Israeli uh Israelites publicly slaughtered the land of Egypt the
[01:24:26] doorposts were painted with the land's blood all the meat of this sacred lamb was roasted and eaten by these people and more importantly the carcasses were to be discarded in Public
[01:24:39] Square for the Egyptians to see the next day right that you couldn't break the bones the Egyptians worshiped the lamb as one of their gods and by slaughtering the lands painting The Blood on the doorpost and roasting the meat and then
[01:24:53] publicly discarding what was left of the animals so the Egyptians could see it the Israelites were literally rejecting the Egyptian way of
[01:25:03] life it was there the most brutal [ __ ] you you could ever imagine and the interesting thing about this is if you remember that Jesus spent his childhood in
[01:25:18] Egypt then this idea of a moon child this idea of a uh a genital cult that wants to murder someone that they raise as their own that they love and that they would use
[01:25:32] him in order to better or to separate their persecution so that Rome is persecuting the Christians not this other intense group makes a lot of sense
[01:25:46] guys it makes a lot of sense I don't think that there's one group in Rome that's Evil by the way I shouldn't even have to say this I think this is just our our lowest
[01:26:00] psychology trying to climb itself out of a state of Ferness of beastiality of cannibalism and that the only way we're going to get out of this is we're going to see certain fingerprints we're going
[01:26:13] to see certain certain situations that show us these things the last supper was a celebration of of Passover and most everyone agrees with that and like I told you at the beginning the
[01:26:29] moon the lunar those calendars things separate but if you if you look at what this is my body this is my blood eat this drink this do this in remembrance of
[01:26:41] me it's giving you a different idea about what the last supper was a sacred oath that no one could say no one could the secrecy is a big part of this a sac secret oath for an underground cult that
[01:26:56] already Cuts their genitals that has built a darker more backro Alliance through cannibalism and every Monarch that we
[01:27:09] know of uh even as famous as Vlad the impor and own Prince Charles is tied to some sort of linked cannibalism because when you look at the symbol the heraldry the heraldry of the
[01:27:24] lion is the lion is the one who's willing to eat and that the ultimate Display of Power the oldest form of magic is your magic is in my belly now and so to eat something else is is to show that you
[01:27:38] hold more power than anyone else who wouldn't have the stomach for this so you can start to understand how this this cannibalistic would be a sacred ceremony that's not recorded by regular folks and that is completely kept
[01:27:53] underground the entire time but we would see remnants of it in different different ways and in different places and the Last Supper is one of those things that's one of those
[01:28:09] things during the uh Passover an interesting thing happened I know that that uh modern Judaism will explain that the reason why there's unleavened bread at
[01:28:24] Passover is because they were in a hurry to leave Egypt which I just think is adorable it's just like oh yeah that's it that's cute it just cute just cute it's and yeah yeah that's true they were in a hurry and so they they couldn't
[01:28:36] bring yeast they they couldn't bring old bread and use that and so they had no no yeast but
[01:28:47] um yeast is a a uraro organism the smallest kind it's it has own nucleus it's it's technically a living organism it's technically a living organism and I
[01:29:01] I bring this up because I I've said to this some of you before but um biologists can even put human genes inside of
[01:29:11] yeast and if you wanted to to look more at the Passover as having all kinds of Technology keep in mind that that the Oracle mythology states that the beginning and the end are the same so if
[01:29:26] you go back to the past technically you're getting you're coming around the the corner of the future and if you're going to the Future coming around the corner of the past you know you got to back and forth stuff like that and so when we come back to the past maybe sometimes when we're looking at bible
[01:29:40] stories we're just looking at advanced technology that we're only recently seeing and one of the interesting things I do think about that is the idea of of if you were tracking uh someone you would use old
[01:29:52] factory methods to uh build contracts and and the people that in Egypt were following these contracts who didn't have yeast You' be able to tell that they didn't have any eurotic organisms inside of their system except for the
[01:30:07] goat except for the lamb total sidebar I realized she do a whole episode on this again but I just I couldn't I didn't want to delete the slide because I worked hard on it Jesus fulfilled the prophecy of Hosea so we got up Matthew 21415 so he
[01:30:24] got up took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt where he stayed until the death of Herod and so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet out of Egypt I called my son you you're being raised as a
[01:30:36] sacrificial lamb you're not working you're muscles aren't being used they're kept they're kept Supple your your coat is kept clean you're filed the finest food the finest water everyone in the temple loves you
[01:30:51] you the temple is your home you're you're raised in this opulence and you you you have no choice but to fulfill your destiny you may even look forward to it
[01:31:04] you may even find it's it's important as I said before pyramids never mentioned in the Bible how can something that large not be mentioned uh without other things not being mentioned and when you start to look at why that wasn't mentioned all that would do is show how
[01:31:17] big Egypt was and this these things were written in a time where you could probably get away with trying to hide things from people people simply by leaving them out of scripture like that so it's even bigger tell I think that that you have to learn to interpret the Bible better because quite simply not
[01:31:33] everything's in there and it's not there on purpose it's not there on purpose because it's waiting for you to uh typology one of the beautiful things about the Bible is it's written in these interesting
[01:31:46] uh harmonies of understanding different levels of understanding and so when you look at the story Medusa perfect example the a lower thinking person would think oh Medusa is evil cuz her hair is made out of snakes an upper thinking person
[01:32:01] might actually have compassion for Medusa and go well what never actually says what Medusa did wrong what what did she do wrong and that those are two two things coming out of the same story and
[01:32:12] that's typology the the so much of the symbolism has a multi-tiered aspect to it and the Bible is certainly one of those things and I think when we look back at not just the Last Supper but more importantly all the other things
[01:32:26] we're talking about it's easier to see how there's room for everything in here because Society was that complex it will always be that complex because you're dealing with different levels of consciousness that are at different points at different success rates right
[01:32:39] in the time so the fact that they left out something as big as the pyramids is a pretty big clue in my opinion that they've left out a whole lot of other things too like a whole lot of other things he said to them this is my body
[01:32:52] eat it then taking the cup of wine he gave thanks to the father he entered into a covenant with them saying this is my blood each of you must drink it in fulfillment of the Covenant itself and so you were hiding in plain
[01:33:06] day one of the most secret rituals that uh Josephus could have been documenting some of the very uh rituals of his own cult he could have been documented some
[01:33:23] of the rituals the cult that he didn't like and so by hear me out by painting the Christians as the sect that's into cannibalism and they're in cannibalism because of the you see what I mean you've got
[01:33:37] this perfect scapegoat it's so perfect it's almost like they've been doing it before and they have there's a ritual the Passover goat is
[01:33:49] chosen so it's it's Clockwork it's perfect um I know that this has already been so Blasphemous I could almost stop now because it's been sorry about that actually it's been two hours maybe I
[01:34:09] should stop now maybe I should talk about the holy hand job next time uh a second let me see I just want to see how many more I got one two
[01:34:27] three no I'm GNA keep going I'm G keep you guys are okay right 107 yeah yeah good to see everybody hope everybody's doing good this long stream this 108 we're at 108 this long stream uh this long stream there you go
[01:34:41] holy hand job what James what are you doing why are you putting that up there James why James all right Jesus is like Mary stop Mary she's like but I must see the I want to have the right hand of the
[01:34:53] father in and he's like no Mary don't say that she's like but but I do gentle pastures Mary stop says but but we've we've got to be forg stop it Mary stop it and and yeah I'm we're going to get weird
[01:35:08] here I if if if you missed the first part I know that saying this doesn't just fix it but I really do consider myself a Christian I'm not trying to be sacriligious I really think that there was just so much more intensity and
[01:35:23] rituals a long time ago that's all and I think the only reason why they survived is because they were so intense and I just I just can't help but notice what I'm about to show you
[01:35:34] here this guy epiphanius Bishop of salus claimed to know the existence uh existence of a Christian set called the FIB FIB onites which engage in the perversion and consumption of unborn child I know
[01:35:49] more cannibalism big deal right but this FTI has claimed Gnostic belief bels engaged in nocturnal sex rituals that involved uh indiscriminate sex coidus interruptus and the consumption of seman and minst blood all in a bizarre Act of
[01:36:04] Christian worship they called this their sacred Eucharist and uh that same uh Gil guy I told you about who wrote the book uh also documents this uh similar thing they said at the table with LA's provisions and eating meat and drinking
[01:36:20] wine but then after drinking bout and practically filling the boys veins this is a young boy that they're getting drunk they next go crazy for each other and the husband will withdraw from his wife and tell her speaking to his own wife get up perform the a gatee this is
[01:36:34] a with the brother this is like a sex ritual with the mouth so I'm sure you can imagine what that is for besides to extend their blasphemy to heaven after making love in a state of fornication the woman and man receive the mail emission on their own hands then they
[01:36:48] stand with their eyes raised heavenward but the filth on their hands and pray if you the one called stoics and and gnostics and offer that some of the stuff on their hands is the actual father of all and say we offer
[01:37:03] thee this gift the body of Christ and they eat it and partake of their own dirt and they say this is the body of Christ this is the Pasha remember that word from earlier the sacrifice because of which our bodies
[01:37:16] suffer and are made to acknowledge The Passion of Christ the they reveal Yahweh backwards which says he she right if you look back on my earlier streams if you miss this stuff
[01:38:30] but it's the secrecy is a a vital part of this thing so seeing the outward display of an innocent drinking wine and eating UNL bread would would be a nod wouldn't it to uh a deeper underground
[01:38:44] ritual and that deeper underground ritual would probably be closer to something of pipus my last book pipus I discussed how this one of the most the largest archetypes no no pun intended but the largest uh archetype ever the
[01:38:59] phus has been hidden from us and expunged from our history because we're just embarrassed about it and the same kind of embarrassment that happened then is is done with the the ritual of the wafer and the blood uh just caveat again
[01:39:13] I'm I'm not here to offend anyone I I really consider religion an important part of of my life and uh everyone's beliefs um I just think that when we look back at Psychology there's so many
[01:39:27] fascinating things to learn that I just can't help but share this stuff so uh if you're making it through and you're struggling I I I appreciate you you don't have to say though you could just go I get it I totally get
[01:39:40] it the greater questions of Mary is a book we none of us know this book we can't we don't we don't find this book all we find or mentions of this book and in this Mary
[01:39:54] the role of Mary is seen as something much more uh I'm going to use the word sinister much more carnal and that maybe the reason why there are at least seven marries I think
[01:40:10] most Scholars agree there's probably at least seven unique Marys that can be traced somehow in the Bible as being unique and that many of them are considered prostitutes is that if there
[01:40:21] was a sex cult part of this again this is a genital cult so sex Cults not really that far away out of the corner it's not like Hey we're already messing with our genitals why don't we play with ourselves I mean it kind of flows
[01:40:34] naturally is what I'm trying to say and so it brings us to the greater question of Mary this book that none of us have been able to read but we know it exists or have been told to exists excuse
[01:40:47] me and uh one of the researchers the uh the last uh sa guy I think that guy's still in there uh let's see if I got his name sorry yeah EP uh the bishop of Salamis
[01:41:03] epiphanius um described what what he had read in this book he claims to have had this book but we don't have the book anymore and he says in reference to Mary taking her to the mountain he prayed and
[01:41:15] then extracted a woman from his side and began having sexual intercourse with her then he gathered his Sean in his hand explaining that this is what we must do in order to
[01:41:30] live when Mary became Disturbed and fell to the ground he again raised her and said to her why do you doubt you have little faith and viewer discretion advised here especially
[01:41:49] here um when Mary became Disturbed and fell to the ground she's minrating and he is gathered not just a
[01:42:01] Sean he has gathered her her blood and that has Disturbed her it has Disturbed her in a deep way because you don't do that [ __ ] if you understand what a clustered
[01:42:16] nun means literally the definition of a cluster none it is related to the menstration the pisan is the month of rest where the the the organs are
[01:42:28] allowed to lay fow simply for cleanliness and you have so much of this is all in the arc ofet by the way if you're curious about this I want to learn more it's all there so much work went into just this understanding this
[01:42:41] stuff because this this ritual was so taboo that Mary's like shuttering at the at the idea and Jesus is is doing doing something pretty intense he's he's T
[01:42:55] he's he's taking his i' I put this up let me make it a little bigger so you can see it he's utilizing the all mother and the all father the ABA and the Yama and you can guess what he puts in his right hand he puts the seen in his
[01:43:12] left hand he puts the ministration and he brings him together he separates them and he stands this is a the pose of the Egyptian pose
[01:43:28] right and in each hand you have the powers of Eternity don't you you hold in in your hands the powers of Eternity when you do that and this is the sacred
[01:43:44] ritual God Jesus is Jesus among among everyone else in this excuse me thought that this is why it's so different Jesus was saying to
[01:43:56] Mary look at what he says he says this is what we must do in order to live he's talking about eternal life Jesus is saying that we are
[01:44:10] supposed to uh quitus during a ministration and have uh uh what What's the CL clinical term uh
[01:44:23] cus interruptus right to bring yourself to and then stop and then to gather that and to use that sacred white
[01:44:34] substance to do something about it right to to interact in some way and this this was so so serious of a ritual everlasting life means don't have
[01:44:51] children I'm I'm just talking about this concept if a child whoops if a child was conceived in this light cake ceremony it was to be eaten by the practitioners as
[01:45:01] proof of their commitment to everlasting life th this if you if you participated in this ritual according to epip feevus the dude I just showed you uh if if you
[01:45:15] performed this ritual and it led to a birth another story explains that the people that participated in the ceremony were obligated to eat the child that was born out of that
[01:45:31] failure and that this is the part I want you to hear that birth was called an Immaculate Conception that birth was called an Immaculate
[01:45:49] Conception a couple participates in a magical ceremony where they're supposed to uh courus interrupt us they're supposed to become so evolved that they're able to gather semen during
[01:46:04] during the woman's cycle and those two things the ritual itself if there was to be a pregnancy from that that would be an Immaculate Conception thank you Raina right if
[01:46:19] you're doing that because of what I just said thank you because seriously this is big take this and come back to what I said earlier that Jesus is a moon child what

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:46:32] if what if Joseph and Mary were participating in a moonchild ceremony and that Moon child Mary got pregnant and they couldn't they didn't
[01:46:48] want to eat it I do not know if they I would imagine they would elicit some sort of miscarriage and eat that just if people are wondering I don't think that they would bring it to turn but I haven't I didn't find that out exactly I would
[01:47:03] imagine it's just going to depend right you would think it's going to depend whatever it takes in this case I'd like you to imagine that Joseph and Mary decided that they could not do that and they brought it to term and that the people maybe around them heard about that and they're like you cannot have that
[01:47:17] [ __ ] baby are you kidding you can't have a devil baby in here you can't give birth to that in here and then they they do that anyway and maybe they're supposed to kill it maybe the reason why see myr and
[01:47:30] frankincense are typically used for a sacrificial offering that when a pharaoh dies like gallons and gallons of this stuff are brought to preserve the the the body to preserve it for the ritual
[01:47:44] and so if you imagine why these three kings would come bringing these things maybe they're bring maybe maybe they're bringing it because that Moon child was supposed to be sacrificed and then maybe it wasn't
[01:47:58] or they decided that to sacrifice it they weren't going to kill it right away they were going to let it grow up this is what I think happened they were going to let it grow up and they they treated this child just like you
[01:48:13] would treat the sacrificial lamb Raina had put in the comments that you supposed to live with the lamb for at least a week I I think that for the cleanest uh well I know for the cleanest sacrifice R it's supposed to be you have that lamb your entire life I don't think
[01:48:28] that there's like a cut off where you know how you going to improve that right but the point is is that you the more Prana that you put into that sacrifice the more Magic's going to come from it so if you
[01:48:41] are if your cult is so intense that you're having these cannibal ceremonies and you're having these light cake ceremonies we'll get to that word in a sec that make maybe this isn't so crazy
[01:48:55] what I'm talking about that this this concept isn't isn't isn't really that far off in fact it's a little bit closer than other things we've seen ask me about light cake says uh says
[01:49:15] Crowley ask me about light cake I don't want to I think I've already pushed enough buttons um but there's there's a before I did this research I knew about a substance
[01:49:30] called light cake which is a uh an Egyptian I'm using Egyptian because Crowley really really got a lot of stuff from Egypt but uh utilize this sex ritual and that's when I first heard
[01:49:43] that term light cake that light cake is the mixture of of semen and and menstrual blood and so you can see how a lot of this esoteric stuff I think it's been cleansed since then I I know
[01:49:57] that because the documentation from preus from James Valentine's book who who had documented these 4,000 fallaces I cannot find that anymore which means someone decided that they didn't want to tell anyone that that we found 4,000 Roman fallaces and that back then in
[01:50:11] Rome women were shoving these things up inside them going pre of us pre of Us come out from forth there preus cuz we didn't for some reason we decided we wanted to hide that from ourselves the same way in Hollywood violence is fine but for some reason you can't show
[01:50:24] nudity we are [ __ ] weirdos okay we are immersed in weird oness and we're covered and surrounded by other weirdos so we're going to act we're going to act really weird one of the ways we're going to act weird is we're going to deny the fact that this moonchild concept could
[01:50:38] even exist that Magic's real or that people would even raise a an innocent like this in order to shed its blood specifically for a ritual if you consider even the Festival of Burning
[01:50:50] Man we are reliving the ancient ceremony of the Wicker burning man we're building this P made out of wood typically an innocent is placed inside of there and burned and I know for a fact that a couple years ago someone died in burning
[01:51:04] man because they ran into the fire and I just simply just did a thought exp I know that for a fact because I saw the police reports or ous reports but but but furthermore the more I thought about Burning Man the more I realized that there's going to be an opportunity for someone who's going to see something
[01:51:18] like berning man as an opportunity to die in a sacrifice and that that person's going to take it and if you don't believe me you need to look at school shootings you need to look at all the other [ __ ] that happens because there is a constant constant flux among
[01:51:33] us to have a desire to sacrifice ourselves or for or someone else in some kind of creepy weird Twisted ceremony for God knows what and one of those people could have been Jesus and one of those things could have been to
[01:51:46] literally deliver the massive rebellious cult into a place of safe safy by creating another scapegoat in its place and if you want to start to look at sarapas and the burning of Alexandria and all the other revolts that were
[01:52:00] taking place and then suddenly everyone blaming these things on the Christians it would not be that hard to imagine that a conspiracy yes a conspiracy was created by a deeper version of that cult let's call them an inner church just to
[01:52:15] come up with a word completely at random and that that inner Church would create certain scriptures certain documentation which would simply point to this outer Church the ones that were not as serious were not as sanctimonious were not as as
[01:52:30] as committed to these things and made them the scapegoat and now you understand how in 100 years Romans could build the most complex Advanced Concrete
[01:52:42] structure dedicated to the pantheon of gods and a 100 years later be torturing people with liveaction kills of Lions because they're
[01:52:55] Christian it's not because they're Christian it's because they were genital Cults and these genital Cults were secret societies and Rome quite frankly didn't know what to do and we still have
[01:53:08] that today we freak out about it we freak out about it and our psychology has grown we're Solly appreciating uh privacy we're slowly appreciating all kinds of things that that that get get
[01:53:22] us further but uh but we're not yet there yet we're still going I definitely don't have time to talk about this but I want to tell you one more thing which is is simply this every single thing that we've been discussing is old factory hacking every single thing in this
[01:53:36] Bible there is some sort of smell thing that's occurring whether you're being anointed or whether you're burning a sacrifical lamb whether you're analizing the evaporated molecules of the blood to
[01:53:49] determine cortisol to determine how how innoc s the sacrifice was that I think on and on over and over again you're looking at some sort of old factory hacking where the Lord is constantly saying I need you to only be over here to only have this smell and anyone else
[01:54:04] who doesn't have that smell needs to be cut off for example I C an example right here consider Exodus 30:30 anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may be served me as priests say to the Israelites this is to be my sacred
[01:54:19] anointing oil for the generations to come do not pour it on anyone else's body do not make any other oil using the same formula it is sacred and you are to consider it sacred whoever makes perfume like it and puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from the people
[01:54:33] I know this is crazy what I'm telling you it's not crazy it's just anyway hang tight if you were an advanced technology that was gardening Mankind and you wanted to raise them out of the bastions
[01:54:47] of cannibalism as fast as possible because you were trying to uh uh avoid a national avoid a a we'll use the word Global catastrophe and and that in order
[01:55:01] to do that you needed people to consciously Advance as quickly as possible that you could see how an AI some sort of flux machine could be installed in biblical times that would be uh competing for fame uh among its
[01:55:15] people competing for worship among these people and that after a while in the Old Testament all these different gods would compete the 35 different gods listen to Testament would finally be only one and then that one God would be using the old factory system to hack its disciples to
[01:55:29] lead them to the promised land to take them here to take them there and that the entire time the only way he could see or even or even have an input into them is through the old factory so it's constantly utilizing smell as an input
[01:55:42] into these people um I know it's a stretch but it's not when you look at it as the Oracle mythology it's really not it's actually one of the most sane things I think that we can talk about seriously it really is and and when you understand what omniscience is what omnipotence is
[01:55:57] what an all knowing god is all those things you're you're pointing closer and closer to something that looks like this and I I hope that this invigorates your religion I believe that all of this world runs off
[01:56:09] belief I think this rational cleaniness that we have is the most Psychopathic thing that I've seen us do to each other and we're living in this system now where you're innocent till proven guilty which means as long as you can drag that that body into a w
[01:56:24] and as long as you can pull a heer out and shed its innocent blood on top of that you did not murder anyone and we're living in that world because we're crawling as slow as we can out of the
[01:56:34] funk of Neanderthal cannibalism aren't we we're getting there but it's taking a while I have uh really missed doing a live stream for you guys I hope that uh
[01:56:50] that the support can stay up and I can keep doing stuff like this if you enjoyed this show I encourage you to join on patreon I have a brand new book out it's called blacke eye Club I think you find it really exciting uh if
[01:57:02] anything in this episode uh wants to Spur more thought I highly recommend my book called Arc of bathat it describes a lot more um that I think you'll find helpful here and let me know what you think about this time on Friday if you
[01:57:16] like it better or worse uh I I chose this time because most of my people I just noticed the audience seems to say there's more people uh on during this time and uh yeah I'm going to close it down but I want to thank you all

SCIPAB (Situation, Complication, Implication, Position, Action, Benefit) writing framework

[ARTICLE SHOULD BE ABOUT]:

- Sarcophagi could have multiple layers, indicating the wealth or status of the individual.
- Death masks were placed inside sarcophagi, with importance given to the interior over the exterior.
- The concept of resurrection and rebirth predates Christianity, rooted in ancient Egyptian beliefs.
- The Eucharist, or communion, is rooted in the concept of thanksgiving, with Jesus giving thanks during the Last Supper.
- There's a discussion on the origins and interpretations of the term "Eucharist" across different cultures and religious texts.
- Criticism of historical figures like Columbus and his perceptions of cannibalism.
- The video delves into cannibalism in mythology and history, exploring stories like that of Lamia and the Thian Feast.

I analyzed a portion of the transcript discussing the politicization of religion in ancient Rome, particularly focusing on the contrast between public and private worship. It highlights the attempt by Judaism and Christianity to privatize religion, which was seen as a threat to the social order and the perceived purpose of religion by Roman authorities. The transcript delves into the significance of sacrifice and taxation in ancient religious practices, including the selection of gods for offerings and the control of religious currency by Rome. Additionally, it explores the emergence of secrecy and paranoia in religious practices, leading to the formation of cults and secret societies. The analysis connects these historical dynamics to the development of Christianity and Judaism, framing them as responses to Roman governance and societal norms. The discussion also touches on accusations of cannibalism and other extreme behaviors within religious groups, and the role of sacrifice and feast in religious rituals, particularly in Judaism. Finally, it suggests a theory that Christianity was strategically positioned as a sacrificial lamb by Rome to divert blame for societal unrest onto a less intense religious faction.

**Main Important Information Extracted from the Transcript:**

- **Religious Practices in Ancient Rome**: Rome viewed certain religious practices, especially those perceived as disruptive or challenging to the social order, with suspicion. Cults and secret societies were regarded with paranoia, particularly if they involved extreme behaviors like cannibalism.

- **Role of Sacrifice and Feast**: The distinction between sacrifice and feast was significant in ancient religious rituals. The question arose whether consuming the sacrificial lamb turned it into a mere feast rather than a true sacrifice, raising theological and philosophical debates among different religious groups.

- **Politicization of Religion**: Judaism and Christianity faced challenges from Roman authorities due to their attempts to privatize religion, diverging from the traditional public worship practices. Rome exerted control over religious matters, including the selection of gods for offerings and taxation of religious activities.

- **Cannibalism and Sacrifice**: The transcript discusses the historical context of cannibalism within certain religious cults and the notion of sacrificing to absolve sins. It examines rituals where animals or even humans were sacrificed to cleanse the community of guilt or wrongdoing.

- **Concept of Moonchild**: The idea of Jesus being considered a "moonchild" born for a specific purpose, possibly as a sacrificial lamb, is explored. This concept suggests a deeper, more esoteric understanding of Jesus's role within certain mystical or religious frameworks.

- **Passover and Scapegoat**: The comparison is drawn between Jesus and the Passover scapegoat, highlighting the ritualistic aspects of sacrifice and forgiveness. The significance of anointing as a declaration of holiness, leading to sacrifice, is discussed in the context of Jesus's role.

- **Historical and Mythological References**: The transcript references historical figures like Pharaohs and their sacrificial rituals, as well as mythological concepts like the scapegoat and Passover, to contextualize religious practices and beliefs in ancient times.

- **Interpretation of Religious Texts**: There's an analysis of religious texts, such as Deuteronomy 21, to illustrate how ancient rituals were perceived and justified within their cultural and religious contexts. The text is interpreted to show the normalization of sacrificial rituals and the absolution of guilt through religious ceremonies.

- **Personal Reflections and Speculations**: The speaker offers personal reflections and speculations on religious themes, encouraging critical thinking and reevaluation of traditional interpretations. They explore the potential symbolism and implications of religious rituals, inviting listeners to consider alternative perspectives.

- **Discussion on Messiah and Sacrifice**: The discussion extends to the concept of the Messiah and how historical figures like Titus Flavius were perceived as messianic figures for their actions, including suppressing Jewish revolts. The notion of sacrifice and redemption is intertwined with historical events and religious beliefs.

- The transcript discusses various interpretations of biblical passages and rituals, suggesting alternative meanings and connections.
- It explores the idea of a sacrificial ritual involving the consumption of a plant called "hsip," possibly connected to the story of Christ's crucifixion and the Passover.
- There's speculation about the Exodus from Egypt, proposing the idea of a worker strike leading to expulsion by Pharaoh, rather than a traditional escape.
- The ritualistic aspects of Passover are discussed, including the slaughtering of lambs, painting doorposts with blood, and the rejection of Egyptian gods.
- The Last Supper is interpreted as a sacred oath with deeper, underground ritualistic connotations, possibly involving cannibalism.
- Connections are drawn between biblical events and ancient Egyptian practices, suggesting hidden meanings and rituals.
- There's mention of a book called "Greater Questions of Mary," which purportedly contains controversial content regarding Mary's role and rituals.
- Rituals involving sexual elements, including the consumption of semen and menstrual blood, are discussed within the context of ancient Christian sects.
- The concept of "Immaculate Conception" is reinterpreted as a ritualistic outcome of a specific ceremony, rather than the traditional theological meaning.
- The discussion delves into esoteric interpretations of biblical stories and rituals, suggesting hidden meanings and connections to ancient practices.

- **Persons Mentioned**: Joseph, Mary, Pharaoh, Crowley
- **Concepts Discussed**:
  - Moonchild ceremony involving Joseph and Mary.

<h2>Chapter 2. Roots of Religious Rituals</h2><p>The exploration of ancient religious rituals unveils a tapestry of cultural significance and symbolic depth, providing insights into the spiritual ethos of bygone civilizations. Delving into the roots of these rituals allows us to trace the evolution of human beliefs and practices, shedding light on the profound connections between the past and the present.</p><h3>2.1. Origins of the Term "Sarcophagus"</h3><h4>Situation:</h4><p>The term "sarcophagus" finds its origins in ancient Greek, where "sarkophagos" translates to "flesh-eating." This etymology reflects the original purpose of these stone coffins—to facilitate the decomposition of the deceased's flesh.</p><h4>Complication:</h4><p>However, the term took on a broader meaning in ancient Egypt, where sarcophagi served not only as containers for the deceased but also as vehicles for spiritual transformation and rebirth. This divergence in cultural interpretation underscores the complexity of ancient rituals and the multifaceted nature of religious symbolism.</p><h4>Implication:</h4><p>By examining the origins of the term "sarcophagus," we gain insight into the divergent perspectives of ancient cultures regarding death and the afterlife. Moreover, it prompts us to reconsider our preconceived notions about funerary practices and the underlying beliefs that informed them.</p><h4>Position:</h4><p>While the Greek derivation of "sarcophagus" emphasizes the physical aspect of death and decay, the Egyptian conception imbues it with profound spiritual significance, viewing death as a transitional phase leading to rebirth and renewal.</p><h4>Action:</h4><p>To fully appreciate the depth of ancient religious rituals, we must adopt a holistic perspective that considers the cultural, spiritual, and metaphysical dimensions of funerary practices. By contextualizing the term "sarcophagus" within its cultural milieu, we can unlock deeper layers of meaning and symbolism.</p><h4>Benefit:</h4><p>By unraveling the origins of the term "sarcophagus" and its cultural connotations, we enrich our understanding of ancient religious beliefs and rituals. This nuanced perspective allows us to engage more meaningfully with the material remnants of the past, transcending mere archaeological curiosity to glean profound insights into the human condition.</p><h3>2.2. Symbolism of Sarcophagi Layers</h3><h4>Situation:</h4><p>Sarcophagi often featured multiple layers, comprising intricate reliefs, inscriptions, and symbolic motifs. These layers served not only practical purposes but also conveyed profound messages about the deceased's identity, status, and spiritual journey.</p><h4>Complication:</h4><p>Interpreting the symbolism of sarcophagi layers requires a nuanced understanding of ancient religious beliefs and cultural norms. While some layers may represent earthly attributes and achievements, others may allude to spiritual aspirations and eschatological beliefs.</p><h4>Implication:</h4><p>The complexity of sarcophagi symbolism underscores the multifaceted nature of ancient religious rituals and the interconnectedness of the material and spiritual worlds. Each layer serves as a testament to the richness of human imagination and the enduring quest for transcendence.</p><h4>Position:</h4><p>Rather than viewing sarcophagi layers in isolation, we must approach them as integral components of a holistic funerary complex, where material culture and metaphysical beliefs intertwine. By contextualizing these layers within their cultural and religious contexts, we can unravel their deeper significance.</p><h4>Action:</h4><p>To decode the symbolism of sarcophagi layers, we must employ a multidisciplinary approach that draws on archaeology, art history, and religious studies. By synthesizing diverse sources of evidence, we can construct nuanced interpretations that capture the richness and complexity of ancient funerary practices.</p><h4>Benefit:</h4><p>By unraveling the symbolism of sarcophagi layers, we gain profound insights into the religious beliefs, social structures, and cultural values of ancient civilizations. This deeper understanding enriches our appreciation of human creativity and spirituality, fostering a more empathetic connection with the past.</p>

Critique of Historical Perspectives</h2><p>In the realm of historical analysis, it is imperative to subject conventional narratives to rigorous scrutiny, particularly when it comes to sensitive topics such as perceptions of cannibalism throughout human history. By revisiting and dissecting historical perspectives on this phenomenon, we uncover layers of complexity that challenge simplistic interpretations and shed light on the multifaceted nature of human behavior and cultural dynamics.</p><h3>5.1. Revisiting Perceptions of Cannibalism</h3><h4>Situation:</h4><p>Throughout history, various civilizations and explorers encountered cultures that engaged in practices perceived as cannibalistic. However, the lens through which these encounters were interpreted often reflected the biases and prejudices of the observers rather than an objective understanding of the observed cultures.</p><h4>Complication:</h4><p>Historical figures like Christopher Columbus and his contemporaries, driven by ethnocentric assumptions and religious preconceptions, depicted indigenous peoples they encountered as savages engaged in barbaric acts of cannibalism. Such portrayals served to justify colonial exploitation and perpetuated harmful stereotypes about indigenous cultures.</p><h4>Implication:</h4><p>The critique of historical perspectives on cannibalism reveals the intricate interplay between power dynamics, cultural biases, and the construction of "otherness" in the colonial encounter. By interrogating these narratives, we confront the distortions and fabrications that have shaped Western perceptions of non-Western cultures for centuries.</p><h4>Position:</h4><p>It is essential to approach historical accounts of cannibalism with skepticism and critical inquiry, recognizing the inherent biases and agendas that often underpin them. Rather than accepting sensationalized accounts at face value, historians must contextualize them within broader socio-political frameworks and engage in nuanced analysis.</p><h4>Action:</h4><p>To deconstruct historical perceptions of cannibalism, scholars employ interdisciplinary approaches that draw from anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies. By examining primary sources, archaeological evidence, and indigenous perspectives, researchers aim to reconstruct more accurate and nuanced narratives of cultural practices.</p><h4>Benefit:</h4><p>By critically reassessing historical perspectives on cannibalism, we gain insight into the complexities of cross-cultural encounters and the construction of identity. Moreover, by dispelling myths and misconceptions, we foster greater understanding and respect for diverse cultural practices and worldviews.</p>
