[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] [Music] what was actually happening in America during the the leadup to the Civil War and even more importantly what what did life look like before all this
[00:12] what what did this crazy world look like before it and before that intel was that's it man's deadliest weapon was Intel it's always been that way but even
[00:25] more so back in the day when Intel could come from a variety of Rogue sources many of which were gorilla gorilla information used to run this world uh you would get information and
[00:41] it could come from a wide variety of sources and and the very first thing that people did in an effort to control you because you were a powerful beautiful species they're going to want to control you who wouldn't want to control you I mean come on look at yourself God oh man I want to make you
[00:55] my slave looking at you right now so it's like how do you do that going to have to control the deadliest weapon you have which is Intel which is information and and this is nothing new but I do think that we miss a lot uh in
[01:10] reference to just how profound this this this thing is and uh I'm assuming you're looking at my slides now and uh thank you and uh I'm showing
[01:22] you a caricature of Nathan Maya Rothchild and in 1815 Nathan May Mya Rothchild laer British government bonds with the exclusive Intel of Napoleon uh Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo I know
[01:37] many of you know this but I just want to really put this in your mind just how valuable this information was this uh literally created this family out of nothing or out of something it created them in his something something
[01:51] something something and it was strictly because they had Intel that no one else did and this isn't an odity this goes back to Rome the trium of Rome knew a lot of things uh they knew what they were going to be proposing years to come
[02:04] sometimes and you would just slowly find out what they had in store for you and so it's not that it's new but but the eclipse of a new country see what I did there it gives you an opportunity to see the penumbra and and actually look
[02:19] directly at this this other source and this other source is the is the competition for the deadliest weapon of all which is Intel and Rothchild the Reg Shield family uh certainly certainly capitalize
[02:33] on this but as Nathan you know is saying here he's he's asking am I being detained he he there's no crime to hoard information even today there's not that's not actually a crime in fact we
[02:47] build our government off of that and I've told you this before but judges police officers uh have a constitutionally protected right to lie to you that is built into the Endeavors
[03:00] of what it takes to build a criminal justice system that the idea of curtailing Intel and using it against you is a valuable tool of government it's not going anywhere it's not a
[03:12] product even of of evilness it's a product of how do I wield a proper sword to cut off any head that's going to try and oppose me and ultimately when you want a government you're looking for
[03:25] someone to provide you with a unionized sense of of boss you you accept that there's a big boss you accept that the big boss is cruel and evil you just wanted to be one guy and you you kind of wanted to be
[03:40] able to predict okay for the next four years this is the big boss I can deal with that he has some idiosyncrasies you know and and I'm safe over here and I can hide over here and I can change my entire religion and and sacrifice to
[03:55] different things over here if if it means that that I can stay alive uh longer and that most of the settlers that that came to uh the old world and were trying to declare it a new world
[04:07] were really stuck with this idea of oh [ __ ] uh we don't have a gang everyone else here has gangs there's there's things called tribes and man they are looking sweet they got their [ __ ] together these tribes do and we want a
[04:22] tribe too we want a gang too and we're lazy and we're hyena and and we're we're we're kind of we're kind of kind of very feral and so it become quite natural for the entire scenery of Gangs of New York
[04:36] that that uh really powerful movie I think gives you a a a good look right up until you know the bigger Hollywood stars come into it it's like a really good movie and then once you see Cameron Diaz I mean nothing against her
[04:51] but just like once you see them you're kind of like oh oh yeah this Hollywood and then before then you're like holy [ __ ] this is intense and I I think it really does capture well this this idea that that you're living in a Wilderness
[05:03] that just has stories just just trees have been stacked in certain way that you can climb stairs and live you know uh higher up and that you're still it's still the Wilderness it's still the Wild
[05:15] and most of the wild was being run uh really by Intel by the ability to predict that an eclipse was coming and then tell everyone if you do not obey me an eclipse is going to come and then
[05:27] that eclipse come and this happened with fires uh this happened with uh a massive theft uh pillaging and rape there'd be certain ceremonies uh sometimes uh in line with the full moon where a certain
[05:42] the the Dead Rabbits I'm sure you've heard this this name would declare that the streets are ours tonight and so we're going to uh basically Clockwork Orange our way around town and that if you're living in New York and you're watching a bunch of people wanding
[05:55] around with jock straps uh singing songs you're you're kind of like hey okay it'd be kind of cool if we had some order around here so I I I'm not blaming what New York was doing it was doing what everyone else was doing which
[06:08] is just trying to trying to relax just trying to find a way to accept what where we are but at the same time elicit some control while also preserving some freedom and and honestly the kind of It kind of conglomerated into the best
[06:23] possible scenario we have now you could definitely argue our system's [ __ ] I don't mind I think that's a healthy sign but but when you look at the teddy Winks man this could have come out a lot worse it it it really could have and most of most of what I see has happened to us is
[06:37] our own fault and when I say fault I really mean choice but I want to allow us to say fault because if we can call it a fault we can let go of that power and say oh we don't have responsibility this is done and so as you're learning this you're really seeing the the hyena
[06:52] literally begging for a master I think that's really what was happening in The Civil Wars people were begging for a master of some kind as long as they elicited this konot tarius this this Village burner attitude that we used to call George Washington that was his
[07:06] original name as you know and so the the people that were the Epic the ones in charge back then were utilizing the power of the eclipse were understanding that Napoleon just lost but I will not share everyone that news yet first I
[07:20] will buy or sell all these bonds or or set up all these other things to profit from it instead that truly is the person that that was considered good for I I think still today I think we have a nasty misunderstanding of what good
[07:35] means good typically does mean the one who's willing to be righteous enough to do whatever it takes to get what he wants I know that sounds [ __ ] very nihilistic even but if you look at it from a pure entitlement perspective this
[07:48] is a a much closer way of looking at at what we would even call reality right now I think we just pretend like it's civilized which is fine you're about to see why I think because um uh of course Nathan Meyer Rothchild
[08:03] I'm gonna have to take a a quick little uh sidestep here ladies and gentlemen because I just want to point out that this guy was born in the city of Frankfurt he died in the city of Frankfurt and his middle name is Meyer and if you put those things together you
[08:16] have frankfurt's and you have Meyers and if you consider this idea I want you to look even deeper at the conspiracy that could be the hot dog manufacturing conspiracy that this man Oscar
[08:29] uh F Meyer was of German descent and had this connection to Frankfurt and that this whole thing could have been some sort of secret plot that we don't know about that it's still unfolding I'm not going to stay on this point because I think some of you guys aren't ready for
[08:44] this kind of depth in uh in this new Eclipse okay but just keep in mind this dude was was coming to his rise too right 1859 he was watching all this happened okay let's get back to the show in May of
[08:57] 1846 this is a a big deal deal because the Associated Press was actually founded in 1846 by this guy Moses Yale Beach the same Yale uh that that the university is named after very much the
[09:11] Arbiter of the beginnings of the gang gang ification of America into something that we would eventually call a federal or a country and that this gentleman in
[09:23] 1846 was watching the ability to capitalize on the information that was pouring in from uh the Mexican-American War and he was able to take this information and do the same thing rch
[09:38] did and withhold predict and scoop everyone else and and in this way he was able to control the propaganda that came into the city simply because he had certain information that others didn't this gave him twofold first it gave him
[09:53] the scoop the idea that he he knew the news first but secondly it gave him the ability to actually shape what the information contained as it came into the city in order for him to do this
[10:06] this speech character uh needed to build an underground railroad of Intel a secret society to pass information and he knew that the only place to start that for the
[10:19] Mexican-American war was in montgomry Alabama and so he went to Montgomery Alabama and he established the the underground listening ear of the ass of what we now today call the Associated
[10:31] Press and the goal of that place was to gather Intel uh collected in Montgomery and to sneak that Intel up north to New York City so you're you're looking at what
[10:45] you might first thought of to be the antithesis of the associated pre press is in fact privileged secret information and that the success of New
[10:59] York Times was purely built on this Monopoly that had been set and this Monopoly required a lot of engineering a lot of different skills to
[11:11] invoke this this was not as simple as as uh oh I'll I'll post this to my to my Facebook page this involved an underground railroad of ships telegraphs
[11:24] horseback and even encryption and as I said before step one it began in in what was then the Confederate capital of the Mississippian culture amua Southern Amura the you maybe call it Turtle
[11:38] Island is probably the best thing you could probably refer to it as and that the southern capital of Turtle Island was really Montgomery Alabama and that if you were going to call this place a new world and you got here and there was already pretty big places there you'd
[11:53] have to go to those places and kind of like hoop there and stuff you you sort of have to like leave your stuff there there and like park your car and eventually over time people would just start to understand that you created this space that you're the one that that
[12:06] made this happen and so step one really was inserting this ear this listening device in the very heart of the South itself in Montgomery so whoops where happened to step two step two believe it or not was
[12:19] a stage coach posi that was traversing all the way from Montgomery uh through the Appalachian Foothills into Virginia where they had already uh established a telegraph office and so right away
[12:34] you're understanding wait a minute James so they were already stage coaching things at that time and yes they were why because there was already a thriving culture here there was already a
[12:44] highway most of chatuga most of the reason why so many states are are separated in a certain point if you look at the points of Tennessee North Carolina South Carolina Alabama and
[12:59] Georgia all of those the the the lines are separating what used to be a pretty big Center and that the way that you would separate a land is is to divide it up give it names like Caroline things like that uh other names that that you
[13:14] can slowly start to insert yourself into you're not going to be able to do this on all the words you're not going to be able to convince people that can we stop calling it Ottawa and call it William town no people like no it's Ottawa same
[13:27] for Chattanooga same for koala same for all of most of the towns that you see that still have this Remnant footprint of a Native American name I think you're looking at the conglomerate Intel war of
[13:43] we order you to call it Jonestown and no we're not doing that and that you're just watching the the the seasoning of culture agree and so if you really want to look back at what the Civil War was it's a
[13:57] battle over what was already here and the only way that you could claim that is you couldn't just change things you had to take what was already here and just kind of guide it but we talked about this how good Trump is at this you want to Pace it you're going to want to
[14:10] Pace the story that's there on the land and slowly turn it into something else as you're about to see so riding stage croes through some of the the the most treacherous uh Mountain terrain seriously the the the southern mountains
[14:25] should not be underestimated and the only way that you could pull that off on the stage coaches if people have been traveling that way a long long time like a long long time things like the Appalachian Trail the Pacific northwest trail uh The Naz Trace
[14:39] Trail all these are considered uh National Park Treasures but really they're just ancient Roman roadways before Rome was here and that as long as we uh ignore what they are we just have to dismiss them as well those are bunny
[14:53] Trails really Advanced bunny Trails deer trails from a long time ago and and step three three after you make it to Virginia then you're able to actually wire the as I said Telegraph the information that you want directly into New York and of course you're the only
[15:08] one receiving that telegram because you've encrypted this data which means you have as much leeway time as you need to capitalize on as much data as you want and New York was just a giant Burning Man festival a
[15:22] giant MH pit of give me a belief and I'll try it on and I'll run through the city and see I'm a mohawk now I'm a uh Scotch Irish I'm a dead rabbits I'm a
[15:36] gang because I want to survive and if I want to live in this place if I'm not an indentured servant if I'm not a slave holy [ __ ] I'm going to have to join the Crips of the Bloods and so you do but
[15:49] back then you had so many more choices you had so many more choices of who and what you would become and some of those choices were so tempting so lusciously promising that it became impossible to
[16:03] say no uh in 1861 Montgomery Alabama succeeded from the union and joined the Confederate States of America which established his first capital Montgomery the state legislature constricted soldiers and appropriated several
[16:16] million dollars for military operations and for the support of the families of soldiers you go there you build a capital and you call it capital this is the
[16:29] capital and you do things inside and you you walk around and you go har har har and if you har inside of a round building for enough time and you keep saying it's the capital and you get
[16:44] enough people to agree that this is the capital you you end up with a capital this is not that hard it's it's part of the even the word Capital was like wait what we're the we're the center this hey that's great I would love to be the
[16:59] center of the state of wait what are we calling this place again Alabama okay sure sure that's what you called it when I got here same thing as Rome you know it's Romulus and Remis that's this is
[17:10] what happened and so coming back to New York people are begging for something to taste they're begging for a task give me something to do and you end up with the Woodstock the very first Woodstock which occurred in
[17:23] 1861 100,000 people gathering in the streets of New York why were they Gathering there this was called the most patriotic event ever held in the city at the time the largest group of Americans ever gathered in what uh in one place
[17:38] filled the streets of Union Square for what purpose and support of the union now you the historian the learner of History was told that 200,000 people were in Union
[17:52] Square because they believed in the union and they believed in the abolishment of slav Y and they believe that the hot and tot Ninjas the racist hot and tot ninjas were out there The
[18:05] Outlaws and that we had to protect ourselves from them and that this is what's required because you're literally dealing with a tribe of people that if you play the right music they will start killing each other that you can come in
[18:20] and whistle Yankee Doodle Dandy and bring enough Strife enough emphasis that that children will walk down to the river and drown themselves because that's how intoxicating the social
[18:33] atmosphere is and it's no different than the Crips or the Bloods and you being handed a gun at 12 saying I need you to kill someone randomly that you don't know because it would break you enough to where you can become one of us and
[18:47] this is no different than saying hey put your penis on the barrel let's cut off your forkin because you're 12 now and it's time to join our cult this is nothing new if anything we've got just
[18:59] more subtle and more uh more dreamy about about the story the story has to have a little bit more off to it now we have to believe that there's a clear enemy and a clear Victor and that if we don't do this we're going to burn in
[19:12] hell and you know it just requires a little bit more of that song that song Just requires a little bit more twiddles and Flash bombs and things like that to to get us going but really at the heart of all human culture is this desire to
[19:27] be led in a fervor to to experience a kind of religious ecstasy simply by being surrounded by a group it's no different than a song it's like what are we playing oh it's Quiet Riot [ __ ] yeah man come on feel the noise it doesn't matter you're there to
[19:41] dance you're not there to listen to Quiet Riot you're there to dance and so if it's Quiet Riot if it's Dad Kennedy's if it's Butthole Surfers you just you just want to be there you just want to
[19:54] interact right and so you're going to Dawn the colors of the time you're going to you're going to find the the same 80s hair band hairspray things that were Happening Now were happening back then but it was just on a much more
[20:07] fundamental level as far as like how we understood our own sense of value our own sense of what we were even doing here the mayor at the time of New York Fernando
[20:20] wood got his uh Hidden Hand here not saying he's a Mason I'm not saying he's not a Mason well I'm not even bringing up the Mason you brought it up not me I'm just I'm just saying that that it's interest this
[20:32] is kind of a cool and that nearly uh he's descri described at the time nearly every building in Manhattan was adorned in Flags Broadway was hidden in a cloud of Flagger there flaggies
[20:47] everywhere exclaimed one writer despite the sober purpose of the event think about this New Yorkers treated it as they always did then like a party costumes livel music public
[21:00] drunkenness this was a spectacle right you would think that from the spectacle of all New York was silly on the Union's Court in fact a great man at many New Yorkers sided with the Confederacy including one of the
[21:14] speakers that day the mayor himself Fernando wood this mayor had just proposed three months earlier that New York secede along with the South but now 3 months later as as the city is burning around him he comes out and announces
[21:27] I'm willing to give up all sympathies and if you please all errors of judgment upon all national questions he included in his speech to much Applause the full text of his speech basically saying that that we are a union town and if you do
[21:41] not conform to these ideas you're gonna your house is going to get burnt down and this this really was go time at this point because when you look at what was happening in the street not only
[21:55] were gangs uh having their own intricacies not Not only was the Irish literally trying to like start its own country and say no this is our Island Manhattan is ours I mean it's it's everyone was ganging for whatever that
[22:09] that that they could pull and uh I see the slides is everything okay yeah I'm come back to anyway everything's okay there right um okay thanks so so the the fervor that was
[22:25] going on was necessary because you're not just going to be able to say and welcome to NPR today we're going to be talking about sweet potatoes and how important they are as spring comes upon us you know you're going to you're not it's not going to work there the propaganda then is going
[22:39] to have to be something much different much different and so just like in Rome as you have these these festivals where people are parading through the streets just looking for excuses to set things on fire to loot if they need money if
[22:54] they're hungry it's like yeah let's just go you know start a r the food cord it's like well what's our purpose there we're going to ask for uh better winter conditions yeah it doesn't really matter if if people want to behave that way
[23:09] it's going to rise to the top and something like an eclipse just something really minor just the dropping of a fork is going to set off what's natur necessarily naturally there William Steinway from the very same piano
[23:22] company they had just opened their Factory in New York you can see it there in the top right corner owner a pretty menacing building at the time and uh uh William Steinway uh wrote a diary about
[23:36] about what was happening in the city and that that at no point did he say this is the most patriotic July 4th celebration in the world no no that's not what he was saying he was like oh my God this is
[23:48] the holy [ __ ] am I going to die are we going to lose the factory there's so much War there's so much fighting why because Prospect building had just opened up a lottery where they were they just were drawing your name randomly
[24:01] saying hey you now belong to us you were now the property of the Union Army now and you're going to report here and you're going to do this and in 1863 people were like what the [ __ ] wh
[24:14] why am I doing that God bless them they were like what the [ __ ] why am I doing that and and and and because you're looking at how much how much angst was flowing through the street you didn't know who was in charge

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
24:29] not only that you've been watching for the last 10 years keep in mind this is at least six years prior to the first shots the even speaking of this of the Civil War for six years prior Gangs of
[24:42] New York were wandering through recruiting people to join our militia join my militia this is just like Hitler just like Hitler Rose by uh parading through the streets with other gun
[24:55] owners the same thing was happening in New York where different factions were saying hey we got we got a we got a nice uh Arsenal here you put on this Fez hat this this collar these things and you come with me
[25:08] you you you be one of us and we'll be safe it was a form of survival why because slavery had been abolished what do you think's going to happen this is this is People's Natural inclination to to want to to team up
[25:24] this is what surfs do this is what uh slaves do this is what entered service do do the first thing they do when they get off the boat they just got so efficient that they did it before they left that they were able to be promised something before they left and that
[25:38] promise was a much cheaper deal than if they could have just Bartered their own contract on the boat came over here and then entered into indentured servitude but this is no different than when you find someone and you say to him hey would you like to be
[25:52] a contractor with me and they're like no I just want you to pay me a lot less but just promise you'll always pay me if show up and that most of us are on that on that on that track right now it's true if you ask any entrepreneur they
[26:06] will tell you a story where they tried to inspire their employee to become a subcontractor and their employee is like I don't want to do that no no no I I want to show up and and get a check even if it's on10th of of what I could get if
[26:21] I just open my eyes and kept my ears open and it's okay the psychology of being self sufficient is expensive and if you cannot afford it it would be immoral for you to try does that make
[26:34] sense and and when we understand what America really is it is the sacrifice of coo shaqui the Mesoamerican goddess we talked about the Rosy Cheeks the Liberty Bell the reason why I cannot look up how
[26:47] many laws we have there's there's no way to count how many pages or words are in the National code because it goes into these volumes and then those volumes are replaced by other volumes that were before it and before that the records just aren't even that we don't even know
[27:01] so we're constantly finding new laws that we passed so if you think every year every three days we're passing a new law you're just looking at the oldest Mesoamerican uh Fable existed of coyo shley which is like every year we
[27:15] will sacrifice more of our Liberty to make our country grow and so the government's doing wonderful like it's doing exactly what what the land has asked for it to do and I want you to look at it this way now
[27:30] that the eclipse is gone I want you to look at it this way because I want you to understand that not only is this country not broken this country is a living entity of the soil that utilizes this magic of the red and white the Rust Belt that you hear about
[27:44] is the same red and white stripes of these old Aztec gods that were their sole job was to grow children that would sacrifice their heart on a temple that was dedicated to either a blue weather God or a red war God and and that you
[27:58] know I know you've heard me say this forgive me choir but this is the Republicans and the Democrats that we the so the land is speaking to us and if the land's been speaking to you this long who are we to say that's
[28:11] broken if the land's been doing it this long who are we to suggest that this is flawed is there upward Mobility I personally think it's harder harder to argue against
[28:24] that and but we've had upper Mobility since Rome and and this ultimately I want you to understand I think the only reason why a government would work it's impossible to install a government that would not
[28:37] satisfy the needs of the people and I think as long as the eager Gore sees an upward Mobility it's fine with it it's fine whatever you got to do because I'm GNA [ __ ] lie to you anyway I'm G to tell you this I'm G to steal all your paper clips I'm going to
[28:53] you know I'm going to do all these things instead so this is the that that that that things are good right Cameron go ahead quite a while ago you had uh
[29:06] offered an insight about what we lost uh when we on an Academia took on the uh discipline of geology next to the way like the Native Americans would describe a formation of a river and the way it rides uh and and
[29:21] shapes itself uh in good health and this place uh right under a bridge on Highway 19 where the OA got fastened OA um Tina is uh figurative in a lot of our
[29:39] stories uh this particular spot is where he got stuck crossing the tuckas river and when he got stuck anybody saw saw anybody hold a snake down on the ground hold it by the head watches you
[29:54] see his body thrash around watch try to break free and that explains in our stories why we have all these rocks in that River Z got stuck there the Rocks gives you the horn serpent you you see the the spikes of
[30:08] the horn serpent in the way that that the the rocks are shaped by the river and uh we talked about this long time ago I I had an excerpt from someone who had written something about this that was just really touching um but yeah the the animism is
[30:22] so much more uh alive if you're not settling here if you haven't just been dumped here when you're dumped here you're going to see a lot less of Hades you're going to see a lot less of the
[30:36] energy you're going to first thing you're going to do is build a palisade you're you're you're going to construct it it's weird you're going to take the very trees from the forest remove their Roots cut them into straight things
[30:51] straight sticks and then dig holes and then bury those sticks in the same ground you pulled them out of and now you're going to feel safe and now you're oh I it feels good now we have a fort and you're going to tell everybody in the
[31:05] fort hey if you don't cut your hair I'm GNA kill you what yeah man I'm gonna [ __ ] kill you if you don't cut your hair and if you talk to these people I'm G to kill you and if you don't worship this I'm G to kill you and if you don't show up for church I'm gonna [ __ ] kill you that's that's in the code
[31:19] that's in the Jamestown code it doesn't say I'm going to [ __ ] kill you okay I put that on but it's that's one of the Commandments if you're if you're going to be in the in the the Croatan or the the sorry the word is sking right now
[31:32] but this uh these civilizations the first uh corporate civilizations that were trying to establish their their foothold here the the rules were a lot more strict than you would possibly imagine and those rules gave you
[31:46] stability because you felt that you were surrounded by someone who had who had enough civilization in fact I think you're about to really see that um uh as I get down um if you cannot see the slide I'm going to hit share again but
[32:00] uh you should be able to see everything now and uh we're back here at U William Steinway um the the piano Guy um I wanted to I've got this in red I can't even remember what what I wrote but I wanted to read it William
[32:14] recounted that his brother Charles met with some of the yeah yeah yeah this was not a noble cause Okay the piano manufacturer William you know again he was the one reporting that this is a freaking mob this is not a everyone's
[32:28] patriotic the people are [ __ ] mad they're mad because obvious for obvious reasons these guys were Pro Union though they wanted this this Federal conglomerate and William recounted that his brothers Charles met with some of
[32:41] the riers in an attempt to save their Factory and that and that he he uh Charles went out and he met with the ring leaders and that he paid them $30 to $40 each um and he ran out of money one of them he had to give a check a
[32:55] check for $30 and the the idea is please just just don't don't burn down our Factory you can burn down any other Factory just don't burn down our Factory and so the very idea that that if you were enlisted keep in mind that there
[33:10] were two people that were that were uh immune from from this enlistment there's a building that ran your name through the lottery and if you came up there's only two people that could not come up one of those were were former
[33:25] slaves and the other was anyone who could who could pay 300 bucks and so you could so not only are you living in a new land not not only are you are you trying to survive and you're going to have to join a gang of
[33:39] some kind but some of these gangs have gained so much power that they have they have learn that they can in inscript you they can impress you you you wake
[33:51] up and you're on a ship and you've left port and you're so far away you're going to drown if you try and swim back what are you going to do this was the basis for building an
[34:05] economy back then and if you didn't do it on a ship you could do it on land as long as you had people terrified enough of what to expect and so before you were being put on this boat in London which was like get you I just need you out of
[34:19] here there's too many rats here we're going to put Rats on boats and send them out because there's too many here we're going to tell the rats you're going to love it there there are four breasted Indian women that are there to fulfill your every desire they're they're going
[34:34] to feed you the the finest pudding you've ever had and it's going to be this luxury they're going to treat you like kings all the gold that you could possibly want is there right all the stories that you've
[34:46] heard were the very first immigrant crisis because it's how you stir a pot we still stir that pot now I realize how we like to say how hard horrible it is for uh countries in Europe and it is
[35:01] because you're bringing in a bunch of migrants but what you're really doing is you're exposing those feral people I'm going to use that word to nonfer people and you're causing a regulation a mass regulation all those people are leveling
[35:14] up in the grossest most horrible way and and a lot of atrocities are happening and everyone's leveling up because of them it's a I think it's unavoidable person
[35:29] just because this is this is what we're going to do we're going to be around we're going to be doing stuff like this someone's going to tell a story and it's not going to be about whether or not it's true it's going to be about whether or not that dilates me more than the
[35:41] other stories I heard in America a was a was a story and I'll tell you I didn't know this before today freedom of the press was invented by the Gatling
[35:56] gun I did not know this during the uh riots the inscription Riots of 1863 1861 62 63 people in New York were being told
[36:11] you're going to wake up and you're going to be enlisted in something and if you don't show up we're going to kill you and that people started to say well we have to stop this so they went to the very heart that was Distributing this news the New York Times office and they
[36:24] were met with a new technology that had never been seen seen before [ __ ] Gatlin gun an automatic turn crank weapon was owned not by the
[36:38] military but by the New York Times the founder of the New York Times Not only was a gun lover he was a republican Not only was he Republican he wanted everyone to pay taxes he wanted
[36:53] everyone to be inscripted underneath a singular tribe if you think about all the tribes that were alive then these men were insisting that we have to join a tribe wasn't a
[37:07] country was it it was just another tribe and we are occupying the land where people would come to collect wood for their bows Manhattan or however it's pronounced right the Manhattan was just
[37:22] the field where people would come to gather gather bows wood for their bows and you're living amongst these people and you're every everyone's tribing up and so there's just a Giant Eagle
[37:35] tribe there's a Giant Eagle tribe and the only way you're going to get this to form is through brute force a lot of propaganda a complete constriction and elimination of any other sources of
[37:48] information and a lot a lot of propaganda one of which is the story that we're only doing this cuz we want to free the black people that is a story and during this entire riots that
[38:04] were happening in New York a lot an orphanage a black orphanage was burnt to the ground uh uh there's a a giant settlement in New York of of freed slaves I'm using quotes because there
[38:19] were people here that weren't slaves that were all colors the simol tribe was already uh a good part of that was already African-American this this idea of you entering into slavery is a psychological decision and even the move
[38:33] on the boat even the ride over on the boat changed a lot of these people's Psychology from a place of cannibalistic my body has value because I have meat to here's a place where I'm I'm surrounded
[38:48] by people that have that are leveled up they have this sense of private property you you know guys in t right now like it's not even private property isn't even a thing like like the people
[39:02] on the ground don't even have that as a concept so you can imagine how much you would have no choice but to regulate around someone who's just simply pacing at a different level as you you're going to slowly regulate to that person and so
[39:17] the Melting Pot of America really causes the the highest to lower themselves and the lowest to raise themselves up because it's just it's just how people how people ra with each other we can't help it it's why being in a social group
[39:32] really has no choice but to cause these kinds of things to happen but it should be profound to us all because what I think happened is is why would the New York Times have a secret weapon that no one else had I think the military had that and I think the reason why the
[39:46] military gave it to the New York Times was because the New York Times was the quintessential Fountain Head for all the propaganda that was going to flow if you did not control Montgomery Alabama and New York you did not control the flow of
[39:59] information this is the birth of the Associated Press and it happened during the Civil War because it was the only way you could do it it's the only way
[40:13] now I've told you this before we're going into a lot more now but the Associated Press was found just five years after I mean Reuters okay Reuters might have been five years after it's five years difference I can't remember
[40:24] which one's first so your entire modern world our parents modern world our grandparents modern world and even our great-grandparents modern world have all been fed off two nipples of American
[40:38] propaganda and those two nipples have never changed never have they changed and only now only now are people like me saying hey that's
[40:52] [ __ ] that's [ __ ] why are we calling this news why are we saying that today Reon magazine told me uh well yeah James the former uh conservative Orthodox Americans have really uh lost favor with
[41:07] Biden because Biden let let let this down on his promise to provide better shoes for military it's like it's like no they didn't no they didn't no one said that there's not a gang of people at Starbucks saying yeah we're mad
[41:22] because Biden made a promise to us six years ago because we that didn't happen that's absurd this is the most absurd things you've ever heard but this is how the propaganda works right now because she showing you the psychoses of where
[41:35] everyone's at and really everyone just wants to be accepted and if you want to be accepted you don't need the right news you just need to regurgitate what everyone else is hearing because that's familiarity right so you're measured on how your ability to regurgitate what the
[41:50] AP told you and that's mind control that that's just you could not get better at that will you repeat what I told you accurately that's how you're measured that's what the news is Right you've
[42:03] seen that uh that beautiful video where it's like our this is a threat to our democracy and everyone's saying it in unison it's it's you're looking at the heart of the penumbra the real the real
[42:16] life stuff here of what it takes this isn't broken this is how you do it this is how you build a national tribe and get everyone on board rich J Gatling invented this proprietary
[42:29] weapon in uh 1862 36inch gun 11 and a half inch barrel uh saw little action during the Civil War but by 1866 it was adopted by
[42:42] the USS Army So Not only was this an instrument for the press and by the press it was never even utilized in combat the exact same thing happened with the DAV Crockett nuclear weapons and which we've talked about other in
[42:57] other places we're going to take a quick break we'll be right [Music] back and we're
[43:25] back all right yeah thanks for thanks for let me do that so so um I I should I should have said this before the break but oh well we'll just let those people who didn't make it back I think that's real this is not a real photo of uh
[43:40] Richard Gatling this is an AI image um uh but the real Richard Gatling looks a lot like Kenny Kenny Rogers I Just Want to
[43:52] point that out and so to me I I'm not sure which one I should have showed you I wanted you to have more of a feel for what this might have looked like um and uh I can't show
[44:04] you Kenny Rogers but I did yeah Kenny Rogers used a Gatling gun to defend the New York Times in the very first military SC up and you learned it here you learned it here
[44:19] first all right so so so James you're saying that that the New York Times was a a field agent of the milit and I'm like yeah yeah I think so because keep in mind I I told you already that the northern armies were recruiting I'm going to show
[44:34] you some slides of this in a second but they were recruiting all these people to join their militia to join their gang and they were doing that as much as six years I I I think it's more like 10 but as much as six years before we can find actually posters where you're like why
[44:46] are you recruiting before this is happening and I think this is why because on September 18th 1851 that's 10 years before the Civil War The New York Times was born so publication printed six days a week every day except for
[45:00] Sunday and on April 21st uh 1854 it was actually because of the ramping up of the Mexican-American war that the paper decided hey we we need to go seven days a week so this
[45:14] paper this paper had a a very important purpose for the propagation of information in a new nation and if you're going to establish some sort of of sovereignty you're going to need this
[45:29] this kind of propaganda on your side September 27th that same year the transatlantic steamer Arctic goes down fewer than 50 survived the times beat the herald with an exclusive eyewitness
[45:42] report and and really this kind of ended the competition for a national newspaper the time the AP won because they had a
[45:55] bigger scoop over the ship the Arctic the arctic's been compared so many times to the Titanic um it's considered a almost like a sister disaster that occurred
[46:09] earlier and what's interesting about that is that the titanic thinking also led to Soaring uh profits in readership for the times that the exact same thing happened for whatever reason this same paper had exclusive uh eyewitness accounts of
[46:24] everything that was happening that everything was seemed to have been forced into their Intel Network and keep in mind we we know that they had one from Montgomery Alabama all the way up to New York and when you start to think
[46:38] about that Reuters had just just been founded in that same decade in England and we've already showed you Rothchild already understood the power of this Intel you're starting to see that in order to form a country the first weapon
[46:52] you would need is is is uh media you don't actually need weapons as much as you need media that that this really would be would be the way to the
[47:05] way to pull this off and people been doing it in a while we just we're just not ready to accept that truth the Hades of it so we don't see that thing but it's true this is the dude November 21st 1861 the times as a leading member of
[47:20] the AP arranged for the agency to be the official receiver of all war news from the government actually had a handshake agreement with the government we will be the exclusive distributor of your propaganda this will give us the scoop
[47:34] the times was an arm of the military and it really hasn't stopped I don't think right now it's safe to say that the times is a a functioning arm of the military I don't think that that that you need to own corporations now you
[47:48] simply just need to have enough uh people that can write stories and submit them to the AP and to Reuters over the new service and that that's how you control the media now so it's not even necessary I think to like be embedded or
[48:01] to own a media company once you've installed this trough of the AP and the Reuters being the only two sources of news and and I don't think this is as true today I'm saying definitely back then and even even into 1980s or so um
[48:15] this is really all you need you just need this centralized trough um Henry Jarvis Raymond this dude who who defended the New York Times with the Gatling gun uh he was a journalist Santa politician uh he was elected to
[48:29] the New York State Assembly in 1850 as a republican so different than than what we might think July 13th 1863 mob triot New York to protest the draft more than 100 are killed that day the times being pro
[48:44] Union and anti-slavery is a leading Target uh and in park roow this place where their building was Raymond defended the rifles uh defended the attacks with rifles and The Gatlin gun and he did so well that that he
[48:58] convinced the riers to attack the Tribune instead which they did and they burn the Tribune building down so so not only did the uh Gatling gun help them win but it also took out their competition too so it was very
[49:10] convenient uh these are the provos guards this is uh I did not mean to have this picture ahead there um but uh this this badge you see here is the the provos Guard the provos guard was this

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
49:24] building and that's is where the Lottery would take place and the provos guard was uh was burn down this Riot and I want you to look at something that's kind of interesting this comes back into the animism where it's like wow those
[49:36] things look the same but if you uh take a look at this these two towers right here in the rebel on the left are in most of the
[49:49] drawings of the day so this is this the provos building had to look like this it had to have these two Ires I say had to because there's at least four different etchings that have I think I might have
[50:02] gotten rid of just kept the best one but this iconic image of the smoldering Towers burning in Flames is the birth of our
[50:15] Union and this happened in New York City this is the provost's office and that these guards here
[50:28] were uh the ones that were deciding who was going to be sacrificed to to go to war and on the right I I have the wreckage of 911 and I I'm not saying look they're exactly the
[50:41] same but I just it's just interesting how this Amira theme this idea of mass propaganda being utilized against its own people and causing a mass massive
[50:55] change to occur the Civil War was all over in Hatton Island these orange spots and this green spot or different highly violent activities that occurred over this
[51:09] five-year period in New York people were uh renting renting hotel rooms strictly to set them on fire like let's all go into this building and rent hotel rooms under different fake names and we'll go in and we'll we'll set the
[51:24] place on fire because we think that this is a pro Union hotel or it's owned by a guy that has a name that that we don't like something like that the history is though there's a
[51:38] Mason Dixon line and and really that's just that's the propaganda you'd use to separate if you want to know what really won the Civil War it was it was equipment the original gang of New York
[51:52] was the union the Union Army was the gang of New York and and no one could could out bribe you as a
[52:05] member you get free coat you get a free hat you get free boots you get free pants you get a free gun you get money you get food you get
[52:18] shelter you get protection you have a ration of coffee three Starbucks cups of coffee every every day you get a ration of
[52:29] whiskey you get to loot strangers rape pillage steal and do whatever you want you might even win a horse some of you will be chosen for the calvary and
[52:44] you will win a horse wi can you think about what it was like to be told you could win a horse back then the hat that you see on the right is an authentic Fez part of the uniform
[52:55] of this 64th New York infantry regimen during the Civil War also known as Cochran's Irish Legion and I'm showing you that because this was not about conglomerating
[53:09] everyone into a singular cult this was about yeah if you want to call if you want to gather a bunch of Irish that's fine whatever colors you need them to wear you guys want to wear kilts I don't give a [ __ ] can you show up to this
[53:22] field and help help us shoot each other and that can we can we just our goal is to eliminate lalia by having lupre
[53:35] Calia right our goal is to eliminate evil in the world by having a pillage day and if we host a pillage day and enough people come this is going to get us where we need to go it's going to
[53:47] give us the uh fear index necessary for our already present propaganda Underground Railroad to elicit it more control and bring everyone into a central trough of information can
[54:02] you can you fathom how [ __ ] woke this is can you fathom how [ __ ] woke it is for you to be a Roth child back
[54:15] then and understand your people so completely that it takes something as simple as a a telegraph a few stage coaches and an underground building in
[54:29] Montgomery that's pretending to be something that it's not and that this is all it takes and the whole time you're dealing with people that just got off a boat that were just finished trading each
[54:42] other's meat in Africa and at the same time you have these people that have uh been piled on to even worse conditions than than slav ship sometimes and brought over here and
[54:55] just dumped off off because it's like we're just we're miserable you're tired you're weak and we're bringing you here right bring me you're tired and
[55:08] you're weak think about it what was Australia what was America this is where you dump your garbage and if you dump the garbage in the right way they're going to develop
[55:23] it for you and you can come back at any time and just say oh this was ours the whole time this was ours the whole time seeing how ahead these people
[55:37] are should be more astounding to us and if it was we would never have these thoughts where we're saying these people are stupid or these people keep messing up
[55:51] they're not messing up they're not messing up this is some of the most brilliant human compassion that you could that you could elicit in a field in the
[56:03] wild through a voodoo spell where where you're blowing white [ __ ] powder in the face of people and telling them a story and it shocks them so much that they're dilated so much they're just like I accept this story this story

[59:28] holy [ __ ] they're stomping at the same time Stomp the Yard you're feeling that that's some power man it's some serious power April 14th
[59:45] 1861 the first war hero the American Civil War he could have been a Mason he's got his hands stuck in this Cod here I know doesn't mean he could have been could have
[59:58] been the main draw was Major Robert Anderson the commander at Fort Sumpter South Carolina which had been taken by Southern forces just eight days before so he'd only been in command there eight days Anderson arrived in New York as a
[01:00:11] rallying figure and he brought along a somber souvenir the 33 star flag oh that had flown above the fort so Mr Anderson Major Robert
[01:00:24] Anderson takes over some and for the very first time they fly this flag that has 33 stars on it and and and he's got his his arm and and there's all these people joining tribes but there's no such thing as
[01:00:38] Freemasons because that would that would that would not be like cool as [ __ ] like if that was all part of it too but like yeah of course it was there wasn't a government yet you weren't loyal to your army pension were you you were loyal to
[01:00:52] a gang that called themselves were the [ __ ] Army and whatever it was that controlled that Network you wanted to be a part of that you just
[01:01:02] did and and this flag over Fort Sumpter I think is profound because of the shape and before I get to the shape I want to remind you that major Anderson
[01:01:19] showed up at Sumpter he was there for eight days for 33 hours that's what what it said say for 33 hours uh Fort stter was bombarded with uh with you know Confederate forces
[01:01:32] we'll call them we'll call them that and that uh finally uh on April 14th the day before tax day it's very auspicious day as we've just learned in the last the last stream especially with
[01:01:47] John the Baptist coming up but that this very very day he uh he surrenders and this 33 flag comes down and not only does he surrender he's he's allowed to leave in peace him and all
[01:02:01] his men are allowed to leave In Peace So whoever is is fighting him is not savagely beating this man they let him go let them go because the people in the South are like can can you just stop
[01:02:16] [ __ ] with us can we just stop can we just stop [ __ ] with each other we're not here to uh enslave you North right can you just cut the [ __ ] this gang of New
[01:02:31] York is not going to make it says the South you guys aren't going to make it you're never going to be able to raise this much capital I don't know where you're getting all this money for your FZ hats but you're it's not going to last and they were
[01:02:44] wrong ultimately The South was winning the Civil War and ultimately I think you would argue that it was rations that ended it it's the lack of food the lack of supplies the lack of ammunition that's what ended in and when you look
[01:02:58] at well why did where was the north getting all this stuff from there's your Hidden Hand there's your Roth child it doesn't have to be Roth child please don't think
[01:03:10] that but there's your true true Triumph it right the Intel of information below already knew who won the war because there was no war the entire thing was
[01:03:24] just a propaganda stream of information collected and gathered and distributed in a very specific way that would uh create the necessary gang of New York that could rule them all and
[01:03:39] the south is like I don't think you're going to make it and North is like yeah you don't know how much money we got we got a lot of money and why do they have a lot of money because they' set up a monopoly and underground
[01:03:52] Intel of information and and if you think about if robj was buying war bonds back then think about how much money you could make when you're buying bonds before the
[01:04:05] war even starts before even people even know right you've already decided I want you to consider I just want you to consider I don't know this but I want you to consider that it would not be that hard
[01:04:17] to send 33 able-bodied Hidden Hand members to different locations within this place and to say we're starting a capital here and that by starting a
[01:04:30] capital all you would need is capital and that the really all you need is a ceremonial building something with a nice Dome and so 33 people built white boobies throughout America and that
[01:04:42] those 33 places became States and those 33 States said we're going to start the largest gang we've ever tried and we're going to Do It in
[01:04:57] America and it's going to look a lot like what's already there because we're not that powerful we can't just come in and level it and plant new people we got to use the people that are there so the government's going to look exactly like that it's going to be the hon theod
[01:05:10] which is not actually people of the long housee I've been telling you that wrong the word Hony nood does not mean people the long housee it means people who are building the long house and that is such a crucial
[01:05:24] difference in translation I apologize for getting that wrong it isn't Wikipedia wrong just so you know but it is people who were building the L house and when you look at the bamal system that was already in place this is
[01:05:38] something Franklin Washington all of them spoke about they brought the iry to the new capital and said will you accept this as a long house will you do
[01:05:50] that and you're watching a propaganda War take place and I think I think this is the closest proof I'm going to be able to give to you which is which is coming up as I told you 33 stars in the for Suter flag just want to take a moment to
[01:06:07] say thank you for letting me do what I do really love researching when about to drop on you I think it's kind of cool and I would not have been able to do it if I didn't have like four hours today to look at all this stuff 33 stars in
[01:06:19] the fort suer flag this flag flew over Fort suer the only time this flag was used in this Confederation do you see the stars this is a diamond pattern for those of you who may not be watching
[01:06:34] you're looking at a an American flag that has 33 stars and they're in a diamond pattern and to the left and the right of the diamond pattern there are two two towers there are two two
[01:06:49] stems and the the slide that I'm showing everyone right now I want you to see that there's an etching that was drawn in 1863 New York and it's on the screen right now for the
[01:07:04] New York Times and that on the right the flag has 13 stars that the streets of New York were were pushing their 13st star flag but the stars that was the flag that was
[01:07:18] flown over Fort Sumpter by the union remember the union came in and took it over for eight days was this 33 star Diamond flag pattern and I I want you to to hear why I think this could
[01:07:34] be on the left is an iroy Confederacy flag the original flag of Amara and in the center is a diamond it's it's a tree and that the tree is is the union of of
[01:07:47] these various tribes and that the yoy was five tribes you're seeing four squares here that's because the central one was also a tribe and that these five families these five tribes had conglomerated themselves into a Confederacy that we know as the iroy
[01:08:02] Confederacy and that the reason why you and I have in our history the words that the Union Army was fighting the Confederacy is because they were fighting the [ __ ]
[01:08:15] Confederacy they were fighting the original people that lived on this land and they were fighting them for control because they wanted to control the information and that the way that you would do that is to ceremonially destroy the
[01:08:29] Confederacy and the way that you would ceremonially destroy that Confederacy is by creating a flag that incorporates that Confederacy and rebrands it as something else and if you look at the stars and the Stars and Stripes of the
[01:08:42] 33 band I hope that you won't find it too much of a stretch to simply just see this is the eury Confederacy you're focusing in on the central part of the uoy Confederacy which is would be the symbolism of creating a federal
[01:08:58] government that the early Americans were capitalizing and taking over the euroa Confederacy and saying you guys are the people of the long house which means we need to make a house that's longer than yours and we need to have a flag that
[01:09:12] looks like yours but is better than yours and that that's how we take over the country we do not get to say we're this now and we believe in this now and these are our icons and we've brought the you know AR is over and here's all
[01:09:26] the other things and Colombia we can try those things as much as we can but it's going to have to meld and mix into the local soil the local land and you're watching this happen my friends the flag
[01:09:38] on the right was uh a psychological operation to invigorate and bring people on board into this other tribe that was forming this natur
[01:09:51] national uh turkey based then later Eagle based uh tribe you were invigorating the turkey of the Native Americans and you were invigorating the eagle of the astec Michican culture that had these icons
[01:10:06] and so you really didn't have a choice but to incorporate and conglomerate with those things this is how you this is how you do it all of these
[01:10:17] things ultimately led us to to where we are now that if it wasn't for AP and if it wasn't for Reuters we would not have a Revenue Act of
[01:10:31] 1861 and it's that Steven says this bill is the most unpleasant one but we perceive no way in which we can avoid it and sustain the government the rebels who are now destroying or attempting to destroy this government have thrust upon this country many
[01:10:45] disagreeable things dadus is saying in one of those as we get to tax you now that that's what the Confederacy made up do the people that were here
[01:10:58] before made us tax you that's what that's what they're saying a year later the confiscation act of 1862 this is the second confiscation act this this would be the legal basis
[01:11:15] for President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation the confiscation act allow the the court to seize land property anyone who was a supporter of the Confederacy and guess
[01:11:27] what if you were a part of the iroy Confederacy you were a supporter of the Confederacy if you did not join that tribe that formed in New York City your [ __ ] would be confiscated you
[01:11:44] would be an outlaw just as Rome declared with the definition of Outlaw right one who's Like the Wolf this is the head of the wolf the same thing happened with the Confederacy you are the Wild
[01:11:57] Ones you are the pheral ones says this and we will end you you you you're not going to make it here oops I hit uh wrong one not only did this work it just kept
[01:12:11] going because like I said before in October of 1851 Paul Julius reuter opened the news wire agency in London exact same thing
[01:12:22] happened it led us to this place where we had the first time ever Global World World War and the only thing that you could

<h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2><h3>1.1. Setting the Stage: Civil War-Era New York City</h3><p>In the tumultuous era of the American Civil War, New York City stood as a vibrant hub of commerce, culture, and political intrigue. Amidst the backdrop of national turmoil, the city pulsated with energy, reflecting the diverse tapestry of its inhabitants. From bustling streets to towering skyscrapers, every corner whispered tales of ambition, struggle, and power.</p><h3>1.2. The Power of Information: Introduction to the Toulmin Model Framework</h3><p>In unraveling the complexities of Civil War-era New York, one must wield a powerful analytical tool: the Toulmin Model. This framework, akin to a master craftsman's toolkit, allows us to dissect historical narratives with precision. At its core lies a simple yet potent formula: establish a claim, fortify it with evidence, and weave a seamless web of logic and persuasion through warrants. Let us embark on this journey of discovery, armed with the Toulmin Model as our guiding light.</p><h2>Chapter 2. Key Figures and Events</h2><h3>2.1. Nathan Mayer Rothschild and the Waterloo Connection</h3><p>Nathan Mayer Rothschild, a titan of finance, etched his name in the annals of history through his shrewd exploitation of exclusive information. The defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo became not just a turning point in European history but also a springboard for Rothschild's ascent to power. With deft maneuvers, he leveraged this intelligence to amass wealth and influence, laying the foundation for a dynasty that would shape the course of global finance.</p><h3>2.2. Moses Yale Beach and the Birth of the Associated Press</h3><p>In the corridors of journalistic history, Moses Yale Beach emerges as a pioneering figure, wielding the pen as a potent weapon of influence. With the establishment of the Associated Press in 1846, Beach orchestrated a revolution in information dissemination. By capitalizing on insights gleaned from the Mexican-American War, he orchestrated a symphony of propaganda, molding public opinion to his whims and fancies.</p><h3>2.3. Fernando Wood: Mayor of New York City</h3><p>Fernando Wood, a political chameleon of sorts, navigated the treacherous waters of Civil War-era politics with finesse. Initially drawn to the siren song of the Confederacy, Wood's allegiances shifted like the tides, ultimately pledging his support to the Union cause. As mayor of New York City, he wielded his influence like a double-edged sword, shaping the destiny of a city torn asunder by conflicting loyalties.</p><h3>2.4. William Steinway: Reflections on Civil War-Era Chaos</h3><p>Within the pages of William Steinway's diary lies a poignant chronicle of chaos and uncertainty. Against the backdrop of Civil War-era New York, Steinway's musings offer a glimpse into the psyche of a city gripped by turmoil. Through his lens, we witness the ebb and flow of societal dynamics, the clash of ideals, and the relentless march of progress amidst the chaos of war.</p><h2>Chapter 3. Themes and Events</h2><h3>3.1. Intellectual Warfare and Manipulation</h3><p>In the crucible of conflict, information emerged as a potent weapon, wielded with deadly precision by those in the know. From the trading floors of Wall Street to the halls of power in Washington, the elite manipulated markets, governments, and public opinion with ruthless efficiency. The battleground was not just strewn with bodies but also littered with the shattered remnants of truth and trust.</p><h3>3.2. Propaganda, Influence, and Civil Unrest</h3><p>As the drums of war reverberated across the land, propaganda emerged as a powerful tool of persuasion and manipulation. From lurid headlines to stirring speeches, the masses were fed a steady diet of half-truths and outright lies. In the crucible of Civil War-era New York, the lines between fact and fiction blurred, giving rise to a maelstrom of civil unrest and identity politics.</p><h2>Chapter 4. Methods of Information Control</h2><h3>4.1. Establishment of Strategic Networks</h3><p>At the heart of information control lay the establishment of strategic networks, meticulously crafted to gather and disseminate intelligence. From the birth of the Associated Press to the rise of telegraphy, each innovation served as a cog in the machinery of manipulation. Behind closed doors, shadowy figures pulled strings, orchestrating a symphony of deceit and deception.</p><h3>4.2. Manipulation of Public Events</h3><p>In the theater of war, public events became battlegrounds for hearts and minds. From grand spectacles to intimate gatherings, each moment was carefully choreographed to promote specific narratives and ideologies. As dissent simmered beneath the surface, the powers-that-be sought to quell the flames of rebellion through a potent mix of spectacle and subterfuge.</p><h2>Chapter 5. Cultural and Social Context</h2><h3>5.1. Gang Culture and Ethnic Divisions</h3><p>Amidst the chaos of war, gang culture and ethnic divisions flourished, shaping the social fabric of Civil War-era New York. From the Irish enclaves of Five Points to the seedy underbelly of Tammany Hall, each faction vied for control and influence. In the crucible of conflict, identity became a weapon, wielded with deadly precision by those with the means to do so.</p><h3>5.2. Perception vs. Reality</h3><p>As the smoke of battle cleared, a stark dichotomy emerged between perception and reality. While grand spectacles like the Woodstock gathering painted a picture of unity and patriotism, the truth lay buried beneath layers of deceit and deception. Through the eyes of William Steinway and his ilk, we glimpse the harsh realities of Civil War-era New York, where chaos reigned supreme and uncertainty was the only constant.</p><h2>Chapter 6. Economic and Political Implications</h2><h3>6.1. Economic Power and Political Instability</h3><p>In the corridors of power, economic power became the ultimate arbiter of political influence.
