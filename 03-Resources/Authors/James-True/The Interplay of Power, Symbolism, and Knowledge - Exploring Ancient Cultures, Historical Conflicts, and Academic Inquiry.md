[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] hello there welcome to Airship 797 hello all good to see you all my uh co-pilot J is in the house hello Renee how are you hi James I well good to see you as well on this beautiful Wednesday
[00:13] the 13th of March yeah yeah camera good to see you uh they've got a few other people here just in case you know if you turn on your video you are consenting to uh to being on this this broadcast uh if
[00:28] you say something and you regret it just let me know it's it's we can bleep it out I'm just saying that uh I think there's going to be a different but that's that's what I'm saying okay so if you don't want to be seen don't don't be seen if if that bothers you I completely get it uh don't feel obligated to do
[00:42] that and if you want to interject something you can raise your hand you don't have to turn your camera on it's okay but as you'll notice that'll the zoom now has this new feature where it only pops up uh people that uh that uh are active on camera so uh with that
[00:56] said uh yeah I got a few things to talk about it's a mismas that all over the place uh ID and Marsh is coming up Friday I wanted to talk about that but I've been having too much fun with melum I promised myself that I would not come back
[01:10] without finding the meme or some of you call it mem I don't know what's wrong with you people but the meme uh of of this word melum that I kept promising was a
[01:22] word and boy boy oh boy is it a word it is is a the bird is the word let's let's see how much of a of a word it is so for me to do this
[01:36] sorry I need to I should have uh stop share for a sec I gotta just pulled this out uh Rene have you got anything I just need a quick little second to drag things around here I just want to say welcome to Airship
[01:50] 797 I believe that's the number we are on welcome everyone and we're going to be talking about quite a few things today but I think James has something specific in regards to meel me melamin
[02:04] I'm excited to to launch off into that field let's let's go right on thank you yeah yeah it should be set now appreciate that and yeah it's uh melons Make the World Go Round And we are not talking about melons but uh we are
[02:18] talking about uh melam melam uh and you guys should see an Airship now 797 that should be sharing and uh what I I told you that there okay
[02:31] actually first some old business this is the bronze geve that we spoke about last time the shenard worn by the Greeks and uh uh the upper part of the geve where it widens to cover the knee is often
[02:43] decorated with a figural motif and this case the gorgon's face herself is decorating the knees and that the idea is that when people would see these glimmering uh
[02:58] shins that the face of the Gorgon would transfix their enemies and I think it's easy for us to look at this as a symbolic thing I have no problem with that but as we look deeper at this whole
[03:11] eye black eye Club thing we'll call it that the black eye theme it could be that the glimmering bronze uh could have actually had a
[03:23] different psychological effect on people and that a lot of different colors and a lot of different things could do that and and one of the one of my Arguments for this was that I was discussing and I was trying to remember
[03:38] this word melum and I knew that it didn't mean melanin just a CO you know although there are no such thing as coincidences but but I I think that they do just share the same there are no such thing as coincidences stop telling
[03:51] people that James you're lying to them okay symbolically these are the same and just going to have to deal with it but this melum is the idea that that deities typically wore melum this ambiguous substance which covered them in
[04:06] terrifying Splendor and which could also be warned by Heroes Kings Giants and even demons the effect that seeing a deity's melum has on a human is described as knee a word for the physical creeping of
[04:20] the flesh we are the knights who say knee and we will terrify you with our Brazen Gorgon knees right right you see the correlation right so you got the knee you got the braz and Gorgon knees
[04:35] then you have the knights who say knee because of the melanion which so this is melanion which is the land of kneecaps anyway it's so so this concept of melon
[04:47] is a is a strong is a strong theme and I've drawn little little arrows because and attribute to Arlo Guthrie I've drawn circles and arrows on this showing you an example of what I'm calling melum and
[05:01] I need to stop and just do a quick clarification your friend here James True is a sophist which means that no one would ever pay me to be a professional mythologist philosopher historian or even philologist so the
[05:15] only title I can really claim is sofus one who pedals information on the street so do not want you to think that there are people in Academia that are telling you that these red arrows are melon themselves this is James True telling
[05:29] you that this is what I think so you got to really really take that with a huge grain of salt but keep in mind that all memory and all wisdom is stored in salt so there's a lot of you know it's it kind of wraps itself around so I just there's my little
[05:43] clarification and uh doesn't mean that Academia hasn't said that I'm just saying I've not actually read that this is me just trying to describe to you this concept of melon and I think that actually this is true I really do think
[05:55] that that what I'm Sugg suggesting is is that because colors were so sparsely considered that the glimmering nature of
[06:07] the aura the body's Aura itself the Charisma itself was rendered in real time on on the screen in Plato's Cave
[06:18] there were certain people that saw an Eminence shedding off of you and that Eminence was so visually more stimulating that that the eyeballs saw that instead of the person that's that's
[06:33] where I'm going with this and so this physical creeping of the flesh the knee the knee the physical creeping of the flesh had two forms there was melum
[06:46] of the head and there was melum of the body now I'm going to change the word melum of the body because I just want you to know that these things were intertwined but religiously in the deepest religious text they were separate
[07:00] words and that these separate words uh I'm about to show you because my all my things are not necessarily in the right order uh why is this here James while I was at Mount Karo the Mamu of oh that's beautiful while I was at
[07:14] Mount camaru the melu of vur my Lord overwhelmed the ganu and the hushu God that was fun to be talking back then man that sounds fun right while I was in
[07:28] Mount Karo the Mamu of assur my Lord overwhelmed the gazano of habushu and they brought to me as their tribute horses silver gold tin bronze and bronze casseroles this is not
[07:43] a spelling mistake I I I shout out but there's someone here particular I wanted to see this word this is hilarious to me that they were serving bronze casseroles back in the day I don't know how they pulled
[07:56] that off so there's a deep dive in this one sentence this is why this this uh slide is here the Poetry was just a bonus by the way I didn't even notice that as I was
[08:08] typing this but but what it's saying is is while I was in Mount Karo the emanation of assur my Lord right overwhelmed the people of Gil xanu and
[08:23] hushu and it overwhelmed them so much that they ran out and brought brought me horses silver gold tin bronze and a lovely casserole I I don't know why the
[08:36] casserole is there but you know I think they were like just in case he does not understand how much we respect him we're GNA make him a cero so so all those were brought out one thing I want you to notice is that
[08:50] all of these things actually have emanation silver is a glittery object gold is a glittery object tin is a glittery object bronze is a glittery object and and believe it or not horses
[09:05] are a glittery object I I don't know if we'll get to this today but I I uh as you know I'm not a practicing uh Academia and so what I'm saying is purely just pulling something out of my
[09:18] uh lovely bottom of my Taurus here but I believe that the Samaran Pegasus which you're about to see this winged a lot of winged things is is the uh melum it's the it's
[09:32] the feathered Aura of what they physically saw and I I think that the early idea of the first time that you saw a horse I want you to consider that the
[09:46] aura of a horse is if I'm sitting on that I will fly that is the fastest thing I've ever seen around these parts and the aura the essence of that
[10:01] horse had this sunlight characteristic this glimmering Sheen to it and that Sheen was so effervescently overpowering that there was really no way to separate the
[10:15] power and the fear of this creature because these are the same words keep in mind that when you're in a a culture where you're only seeing three colors right when you're in a primary culture state when you're psychologically only
[10:28] having a few emotions to choose from fear and power are are exactly the same Radiance fear power and Almighty and effervescence and Beauty are all the
[10:41] same word in Samaria when it comes to this melum when it comes to this emanation demons carry melum just like royalty
[10:53] does it's it's the it's a glimmering would be a way to look at it it's a shimmering that you would see the radiance that's mostly the word you hear about and the radiance scares
[11:06] you it scares you basically um this uh image is the closest visual parallel to the radient descriptions of Yahweh in
[11:26] Ezekiel 1 and8 and it appears in this Illustrated enamel tile from Asher which is thought to to date to the early 9th century BCE and for those of you who might just be
[11:38] listening this is the winged uh Archer symbol that you've you've I'm sure you've seen it's a bearded dude who's uh has wings and he's inside this round spiral emanation and that emanation has
[11:52] these flowery feather I mean fiery feather Aura and more importantly there there's a separation there's a horizon line inside the aura and that the melum is always separated between the top half of
[12:07] the aura and the bottom half of the aura it's like there's a polarity that they're seeing and for anyone that's sung gazed I I don't want to speak for everyone but I think you probably can kind of see
[12:22] this similar kind of a shape right that when you look directly into it does have this sort of wings horizontal Wing aspect and then its own inner imination that's kind of behind that if it makes
[12:34] sense where the wings kind of stick out right they broadcast out from you typically they'll when you're looking you know kind of have this thing and that that would be this wings but then
[12:48] behind it is this is this Radiance and you and I are hallucinating that right now this is how we're we're seeing the Sun and that back then they saw the same
[13:03] brightness from the king and the sun look the same this is what I'm trying to suggest anything that had a lot of conscious emanation in it was just
[13:14] really bright just really really really had a really bright Hue to it and so power looked had a lot more effect over visuals than it does now in fact I bet
[13:29] you that we learned to mute the hallucination of melum so we could stand our ground in its presence that the better we got at being
[13:40] in power the less oh that and it finally came in I can see what's going on now it's like that and so the drum of Consciousness is constantly being stretched over and over and you're able
[13:54] to jump into this thing right this is this is this is giving this insight into possibly how they how they saw and so this just a little bit larger image on the left same thing this just
[14:08] happens to be one of the earliest carvings of it that uh back then this uh Samaran King named alarmy hate that guy he's he's always carving over these ancient stuff but anyway uh
[14:20] there's that but then on the right there's this other Samaran King image and you see this a lot in the Samaran art where there's a Assyrian King he's got the beard of course but then he has These
[14:33] Wings he has these These Wings and and I'm just suggesting that one of the many many interpretations that we could add to this is something I really like though is that when you looked at the powerful Lord when you
[14:46] looked at the ball you you were you were freaked out by how powerful he was and and one of the things that you did is your Village actually utilized
[15:00] this this is kind of cool because your your village actually started to utilize this as a defense I think we're going to get to that in a slide or two this is another version of that but instead of the king I want you to see I think you're just looking at the sun right
[15:15] this is the wing Su disc and it's not necessarily just a oh that's nice the sun should have some Royal feathery eagly I mean that's fine but I I think you're literally this is much more
[15:28] literal this is much more trans transformative meaning that if you were to actually want this symbol to carry weight it's going to have to physically be a visual cue to
[15:42] something and I think that this is just a better a better historical look at the Opthalmology of what was actually
[15:56] there this is the Ada to seal I'm sure many of you seen this this is a rolled uh piece of clay and you you you dip the rolled piece of clay in ink and then you roll that over the page and it leaves I'm sorry it's probably not ink it's
[16:10] probably more like they roll it inside their little you know their little they're always they got a lot of clay they do a lot of clay work and when you go to Staples back then it was like yeah I needed some clay tablets I've run out of clay tablets all my clay tablets
[16:24] dried up I was on vacation I forgot to miss my tablets I need some more then then it's like you know you're just selling me piles of mud right it's like yeah I know I know but it's a business we this is how we're building an economy I'm going to sell you these piles of mud
[16:38] that are pre-soaked so you can roll your little your little clay Ada seal in it right uh so you would roll the SATA seal around so you really actually have to look at this backwards but I'm just putting this out and uh there's some
[16:53] information on the screen if you guys just want to actually like see like well who's who and whatnot um because there's a couple there's actually just a lot of cool things um about this but one thing in particular I want you to see is is
[17:05] that with this idea of Melon now I want you to notice that all these figures have one thing in common and that they're carrying some sort of emanation they all have some sort of
[17:20] unique unique Radiance don't they one is much more of a watery starting from the left um although although the scholar who is much more qualified than me I won't do another sidebar about how iopus
[17:34] but the scholar is going to tell you that that that this guy he just has two ponytails um and I I don't mind fine it's cool but but if pretend like mum is real I would like for you to consider
[17:47] that those ponytails are actually the emanation of melum and it's only up at his head and that right next to it there's a different emanation of melum this is the the war goddess I I believe it's ishar in this situation it'll
[18:02] actually say below but she's the war goddess and she has the emanation of these Spears basically so the energy that you see when you see her is more spear-like it's more warlike and then we're skipping the guy coming out of the ground we can talk
[18:16] about that later although he does that is the sun the emanation of the sun rising by the way he's having to cut the mountain to pull himself out and you see he's got his own emanation it's a new kind of emanation hasn't fully formed it's not sharp it's not full of objects
[18:30] but then next to him is this uh I'm going to call him thock even though that's a Mesoamerican term but basically you're just looking at the the the god of rain but also the Harvest and of the crops and so this emanation is much more
[18:45] of a wavy kind of uh it would be the the blue priest versus the Red Priest The Bernie Sanders would have this kind of melum and the Republican would have the spear melum to to the
[19:00] left and then the advisor the one on the very right with the two heads the Janus figure does not have a mellow on his body but does have one on his head and I'm getting ready to get to
[19:14] that so these are the creatures you notice do not have imination but the figures do even the eagle this this Eagle comes in to steal
[19:29] the sacred tablet I think this is basically an early version of Apollo he's a racing all of known it's the tablets of Destiny so he's coming in to steal Destiny which you could think of
[19:40] is all that's going to happen has been stolen by this this jerk Dragon bird they they they have a they don't like this bird that's why I called him a jerk they they think he's mean this is Zoo
[19:53] the bird Zoo anyway uh again I know cyborg King James here but here we go it it's seriously this is thock and and hulley it's just the two Gods you're
[20:08] being offered up to the same aminations and you could think of this as hunt gather hunt gather couldn't you like the God of War would be hunt and the god of gather would be thock so you know
[20:22] Democrats would be gathered let's gather things right and Republicans are like let's kill things let's hunt things and so the the aminations of those make a lot of sense and it's just interesting that they're they're still right there in
[20:35] Samaria so there's there's two kinds of melum and and one of the big ones is this head melum and it's actually going to be the main word melum as you're about to see once I split them I just haven't split him yet because we haven't gotten that
[20:48] slide but as I told you on the wing figure there's a a top and a bottom uh charisma I'm sorry Radiance and that the
[21:01] top is is is typically seen as more horned and I believe that these horns are the same things that God transmitted into Moses and even Noah and and all these other different ideas is in fact
[21:16] there's a a big argument where people are saying Michelangelo mistranslated something else and that's why he has horns but but I I think that there's such a beautiful beautiful symbology here it
[21:28] doesn't really matter how you look at it ultimately back in Samaria the scholars are going to tell you that those are horns in the bottom right they're going to say no those are those are ox horns I'm not qualified so you
[21:42] know you should listen to those but but if you come back to the idea of of this Radiance coming from the head there's a
[21:51] lot of themes discussing melum where uh a God's melum was uh removed from him
[22:04] Mamu had her melum raped for example uh when a when a King dies they only notice that he's not in charge because he no longer holds
[22:17] melum he no longer possesses melum so it's something that gets taken away from you and this is what happened when uh when uh when Moses came down from he he asked hey God can I see you God said no
[22:33] you can't see me I I'm naked over here it'll burn your eyes out and it's God's probably like dude my junk is so big it'll blow your you can't look at it and he's like well can I look at you backwards if you turn around can I look at you and God's like yeah yeah you can
[22:47] look at my ass you can check out my ass so God turns around and shows him his ass and Moses is okay he walks down but Moses doesn't know this but everyone else is fre
[22:59] out they know it's Moses but he terrifies them the radiance on his face is terrifying this is the melum of this is
[23:14] the mask of melum this is the melum mask and melanin I just isn't that interesting because that's a mask too Africa explains that that's what it is that without your mask you're not
[23:27] able to hold the self there's no ability to hold self without the mask having it there and so Moses came down from the mountain bearing two tablets of the paack Moses was not aware of the skin on
[23:43] his face since he had spoken with him as in Yahweh okay so there's this amazing article here
[24:00] by Seth L Sanders and I give you link but it's it's like so it's free but it's a you have to like log in as a Academia then you have to sign for swearing you're not a real academic you're just a dude who's interested in history then
[24:15] you get on this mailing list and then you're only allowed five articles a month unless you want to pay $79.95 and I'm just like yeah right and so anyway I don't have a link for you but but I just I just want to want to look up this guy
[24:28] you can find it yourself if you want but this Seth Seth L Sanders really taught me a lot about about these different emanations and this Mamu which he calls it Mamu is is this uh emanation of the
[24:42] face it's not actually of the body itself and as I'm showing I'm about to show you four pages I'm I'm not going to read the whole thing but I just I like that you can see the pages because some of you might actually just want to read the whole thing so you have that but also you're going to see some
[24:56] underlining Parts the parts that are underlined in blue are showing you the emanation from the waist up and the parts that I've underlined in red are showing you the melum from the waist down I still haven't told you the new
[25:09] word for melum it's Pulu but you'll see that it's kind of awkward to carry in the mouth and I didn't want to give it to you right away so melum is still the overall concept it's okay to talk about that but I just want you to see that there is an interesting difference

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
25:23] there's a polarity to this Charisma um as it comes in so as I told you before I already covered this want you to know that well actually here's the word both the Samaran and the Acadian languages contain many words to express the
[25:39] sensation of knee remember we talked about that earlier that's that fear that emanates inside of you and one of those words is the word p now this word
[25:50] p also could be just said as hulo and I think people were like dude no one's going to remember this let's just take out the tea and and stop with people so yeah it's pooo is another acceptable way of saying this but it's more of the word for this uh emanation
[26:06] that's more fearful and the fearful part the lower part so I want you to start to think about the symbology here because the lower part is the fearful part and the
[26:19] upper part is the Divine Mighty part and so your melum is made up of these two superimposed pairs and the polarity between them is actually part of what gives you your
[26:32] power and that the reason why the uh blue was so effective is because typically you were decorated with trinkets typically little pieces of
[26:45] shiny think about fish and just what a lure does that it's there to reflect the light for to attract the attention of the fish and that that attracting the attention of the fish is probably giving
[26:58] us more of a clue about what's really happening it the fish is not like oh that's fascinating because I have a deep dilational appetite and I'm here to be fascinated that that's not what's
[27:09] happening the the Poo the glittering is Hypnotic the glittering is not interesting it's hypnotic it's fear-based because of how hypnotic it is and I've told a story before but if
[27:28] any of you have ever encountered a rattlesnake you may have had that experience where when you've heard the Rattle and you're truly in a wild situation you can actually feel the terror riding inside it seems to grip
[27:42] the space between your rib cage and just kind of says I'm in charge now and you don't feel like you can move and if you think about what that might feel like a deer in the headlights uh a
[27:56] fish uh with the lure all these things are giving you a clue about how hypnotically provocative Charisma used to be versus maybe how much better we've
[28:10] gotten from melting separating ourselves from the mam the radiance of how powerful everything actually
[28:26] is which brings us to again here's the red and the blue I've talked about the Pulu is inspiring Terror and it's also could be looked at as Majesty Or
[28:40] Glory the blue the melum the terror and the glory of my royalty can be thrown down you can lose your royalty you can uh you were dressed in
[28:52] Pulu but you Dawn melum so kind of shows you the difference I don't know what that difference actually means I'm not here to explain it to you I'm just here to show you the subtlety it's to me it's fascinating that there's a subtlety
[29:07] there and it could be just like when you look at the Sun and there's wings that jut out of a circle then there's the Divine Radiance of the circle itself and that maybe those are somehow related to that I think it's a fun thing to just
[29:20] explore to even realize that they have these malamu is head gear it's a helmet and we had such a great conversation Monday one of the things we discussed
[29:34] was Hades and this idea of a helmet that would make you invisible and so here I am minding my own business uh prepping for this show and I and I read this let see where
[29:49] this is so when we encounter demons in the world according to the Samaran the reason why we are not able to see them it's the same reason why God
[30:00] is not able to see them because the demons have hid themselves in malamu the demons are wearing a kind of Charisma and this Charisma makes them
[30:18] invisible so all of a sudden Mamu is starting to look like the helmet of Hades that if you Dawn mam on your head the radiance could be so strong
[30:32] that you would become invisible it says right here obviously somebody covered with a malamu can see everything but cannot himself be
[30:45] seen A headgear which is meant to inspire Terror and at the same time make its bear unrecognizable is by those two Clues clearly defined to be a mask this guy's talking about mask which is also
[30:58] interesting that's that's why I wanted you to read the the article but this is school as  this is cool as because it's showing you that that if you're you can
[31:12] be so intimidating that you become invisible and this this intimidation would be something that you would Dawn on your head check it out your
[31:26] psychology your mental state how powerful you felt could have been read in the eyes of ancient
[31:38] man that a long time ago they could see your thoughts with such telepathic power that they would run because they would understand and I think this truly truly comes back to our sense of smell this
[31:53] gland that we shut off because if we can see in the lit how much we're not talking about color what else are we filling that with but possibly an older sense that we've
[32:07] turned off that we turned off as we turned on color in the eyes we turned down smell the smell allowed the melum the glowing Embers of people to
[32:21] dim the Kings when they go to meet other villages would be decorated for their Pulu keep in mind melum is dawned Pulu
[32:35] is is adorned and so before you send your king out you're going to hang a bunch of fishing lures and bottle caps on him because you know when he goes into the
[32:47] other Village the other Village if you do this correctly they will send you casseroles they they will they will Rush casseroles out to you and say do not hurt
[32:59] us we we bow down to your melum your Mamu and we do that because your Pulu is so captivating so radiant and so
[33:12] terrifying I I think this is early this is early thought this is early psychology this is the essence of how we perceive and
[33:24] it's it it gets even worse I mean cooler but but kind of worse because when you start to think about how how this how is this in the room remember the truth is always in the
[33:42] room this is not something we've just gotten better at where is Hades where is Hades the helmet of invisibility where is it in the room this is what I've been asking since breakfast by the way thank you for being my patience CU you let me
[33:57] think about this and I get to look at this is so freaking fun but what what is it in the room right now that is this mask of Hades and and I just have one
[34:10] idea it's just one I thought about Perseus and I thought about how that dude the reason why he can kill Medusa is not because she can't see
[34:26] him it's because he gets to kill her anonymously that if Perseus can wear a mask over his head if he can put on the right malamu I'm changing the definition of malamu just a little bit but actually I'm not from Samaran standpoint because this guy talks a lot about how this is a
[34:45] mask it's a mask and that if you were to go murder the innocent princess Gorgon one of the finest families that you've ever known in the med terranean and if you're were going
[34:58] to go murder her because it would make your village feel better anonymity could be what allows you the enough power to commit
[35:13] murder and I think this is showing you the truth in the room right now it's showing you right now that this is how it works and it there's that slide we we'll come back to this this is it right here
[35:26] this is the truth in the room the Executioner is utilizing the power of malamu isn't he I can chop I can chop this dude's head off and I can go and pick up bread from the
[35:46] bakery and make it home before dark everyone in the village knows who I am and no one calls me Axe Murderer okay my brother cuz he gets drunk and we like to fight he calls me Axe Murder cuz he likes to rub me the
[36:02] wrong way right but no one in the village calls me that because of I have the right malamu this is the helmet of invisibility isn't it the Executioner is
[36:13] invisible and here's the thing if you were back in Samaria just hanging out minding your own uh casserole you know got your little copper casserole actually not even invented yet you're
[36:26] still you know you got your bronze casserole a lot of uh digestive problems back then but hey it's pretty and you see an executioner I'm talking about
[36:38] whatever that version was then if you and I saw an executioner someone dressed in a clown costume with a chainsaw has malamu because you cannot recognize who
[36:52] they are and you instantly are fearful because of how powerful that makes them they have the ability to do whatever they want because they're inside that Mam and of
[37:08] course what's up with the Marines why is it that every blue collar military has some sort of horse Blinder placed over their
[37:23] eyes the Marine will constantly see Darkness because because there is a rim of Darkness that is constantly filling their eyes they are taught to see dark they are taught to limit what they see they are taught to look in a specific
[37:38] Direction and think Darkly and that this would give a sense of melum this would install a sense of malamu in them and when you see the Marine you would do that what the
[37:50] is Camelot camouflage guys it's malamu and all the militaries wear camouflage so the truth is in the room more than I even thought before I started
[38:05] this and I I think personally one of my favorite depictions of of Medusa is this sculpture it's in Rome and uh I I don't know the artist sorry but the the helmet of
[38:19] Hades is adorned it's beautiful it's a gorgeous hat and it comes with all the Triumph he doesn't even need to wear clothes and it's that same kind of thing
[38:33] thank you for your service right thank you for your service who wouldn't want to wear this hat and all you got to do is anonymously go in there and and bring her head back because it's going to make all of us
[38:47] feel better right now and that would terrify you you saw that helmet and you knew what that meant that would terrify you this is the
[39:01] pautu and the malamu and this again I'm not Academia I don't think anyone's ever said this I it could be they have but I haven't read it but I think the reason why you're looking at the the reason why this dress is the way it is is because
[39:15] they're trying to Showcase to you how important the ornamentation was for the palu and the malamu and that these horns on top are one of the reasons why I don't think the Rocks
[39:28] horns is because the this figure on the left those horns are a lot different and I think they're a lot different because the aura is different and why would the aura be different because one of them's an executioner
[39:41] another one's a casserole H hander outer those people are going to have different auras they're going to have completely different Vibes right they're not going to have the same sort of and and your eyes are going to render that
[39:56] accordingly would be necessary for you to do that gotta go back here and make sure I didn't miss anything all right that's all I got on
[40:23] that unless anyone has any extra I mean I'm sort of on this but yeah go ahead Cameron yeah I think
[40:35] uh this this concept of Mamu and PLU is interesting especially well I'm just right now uh kind of going off this idea that the PLU was had more of a hypnotic effect um which is interesting given
[40:51] that it is like it does grab your attention to hypnotize it makes me think of like the dark places where an Engler fish's light works to the same effect although that's something from the the head but uh it it makes me think of
[41:04] um the difference or well the similarity actually between seeing and reading or vision and literacy and uh I think in Monday's wonderful conversation um it started coming up about the Phoenician
[41:19] blue the DI that they used uh and I think about Cadmus The Phoenician and there's a you know there's a historically we say the Greeks picked up language after after the manow and their fiso SS conrete and all that
[41:33] stuff exploded and uh Greeks lost language for a little while and they borrowed it from the phenicians well mythologically I think Cadmus was considered Pho Phoenician the guy who found a though thieves and he there's a story where he gives his slave a tablet
[41:47] with written instructions on something to bring her or bring him he gives tells him to give it to the wife the slave goes and gives it to the wife uh and it's just amazed that she knows what to get with this little tablet with you know things written on it uh he wears it
[42:00] for the rest of his life as a magic amulet or as a magic uh something to wear and uh I think you might uh you've already talked about before you know we don't have the cones I think to see as much
[42:14] blue as we do see it I and I think uh these deities or these Powers this opulence and this radience that uh when people don't understand it they see it maybe as Mamu or is the best they can do because they actually can't avoid seeing
[42:29] it it's not it's something different than uh the realm of Hades or unseen it's it's a power that they're having to engage with but they just cannot compute um I mean this is you know working I'm
[42:41] just kind of working uh but I I I uh just think it's fascinating as as we we talk about uh these groups of people
[42:54] or these teers of understanding and these like degrees of masonry and uh it's I could see how education could Ser a purpose in the sense with Orthodoxy and things
[43:07] uh as far as handing knowledge down but but not wanting people to remember that they it was suggest the knowledge was suggested in the first place and just thinking it's facts like uh like thinking the sky was just blue and that you didn't have to learn that
[43:23] and there wasn't someone that taught you that you know they don't want you to remember that part because you're going to keep coming back to the well I don't know this these are just tangents this wonderful stuff though thank you very much for sharing malamu and the Pluto and well absolutely you
[43:35] know it it you would think I would I until until now I I've thought that evolutionarily speaking we would just want all the information as
[43:48] much as we can as soon as we can full blast all the time and it's we're learning more and more that that's a hard horrible idea that would be the worst strategy you
[44:01] could have and we started out with that and we begin to to sense we knew each other's Radiance which meant that dude's a psychopath I'm terrified and that we would know who's a
[44:15] psychopath before even the psychopath would know and so that before mirrors we were mirroring each other we were having to show show each other who we are and and how we do that is man why
[44:29] does everyone their pants when I show up I brought a bronze casserole and everybody likes me and it's like because the your divine power terrifies them it scares
[44:41] them and everyone as a society would regulate back to that no one is interested in I want all the right Information Society proves that Society tells people don't look here don't go here don't even in the very earliest
[44:55] thing when Society starts it's nothing nothing but rules and I thought I I thought that no that's not how it works no that is how it works which means that we are we learned a long time ago if we
[45:06] limit our field of data we do we do better it bites Us in the ass all the time we can't get away with that but we are forced into a macular form of thinking just to survive and I think
[45:20] this is why words are what they are Cameron if you if you consider the intimidating Power of Words and how Sticks and Stones can break my Bon blah blah blah and that unless you understood what someone was saying you'd still be
[45:35] able to pick up their body language but the the the thoughts themselves would be impermanent to you until you learned language and that in a way by us shutting off our smell it was the only
[45:49] way that we could create a drive-through window security night drop deposit for every sensory experience that we would ever have because we're literally saying I'm not going to experience you until you put it in the box it's like
[46:04] going into a convenience store in the middle of Kansas City uh in the worst part of town and trying to get some donuts personal experience and you're just like how is how much security is this required for me to buy a 79 cent
[46:17] pack of do are you serious so I rolling a rotisserie dial around with a doar 16 and you're going to roll these don't this is this is what we're doing now and yeah that's what we're doing now because of what happens in the world so
[46:32] every single experience right has to be know you put it in the tube you close the tube and you and you you send it through the shoot and maybe I'll open it yeah in that system like if you were like an outsider like I'm trying like I imagine like that would be like trying
[46:46] to pull a fish out of a rock as you said the other day yeah yeah exactly it it's so macular ends up being the only way that we could even function in the world without just
[46:58] you know losing bodily fluids every every time we we we knew the truth and you know what this is like my life like like I I I know what this feels like I know what this feels like sometimes to know too much to see I know we all do
[47:13] where you you're watching what's happening in real time and you know there's nothing you could do even though you have all the information you know all the information and it's making it worse not better James go
[47:25] ahead oh yeah I just uh some reason I keep like picturing uh said wandering into the convenience store to get something it'd be like the naked dude walking in
[47:39] your house or something you're like whoa I don't need all that information right you're like can you please cover that up so that way exactly you can actually present you know that way I can see you because I don't want
[47:53] to see you yep kind of thing right exactly exactly it yeah I just kept picturing like a I don't know why uh seeing unrecognizability in
[48:07] invisibility is very crucial too I think or I mean it's very very helpful because they are very closely connected as is anonymity I think that there's a form of invisibility that you capture within that uh and uh very it's very empowering and I love that you use the word
[48:21] recognize or that you were that you were playing with the phonetics the way you were the other day because you are recognition is reinforcing your cognizance and it's uh it's just it's just beautiful that you that you you know you've yeah and and it's
[48:35] interesting I'm glad you brought that up because memory is a form of melanation we we are choosing to remember am I going to recognize that no that I'm not going to recognize that it's gone guess
[48:49] what it's gone now your filament's burned out you don't know why it's burned out right you got road rage rashes all over the place you have no idea how this happened but hey at least you're at least you don't know what happened then that becomes like a wow
[49:04] this is really valuable skill this is really valuable I can use this and we as a culture can use this it's it's it's I never would have thought of it I never would have thought
[49:17] this will save me and and it it it does it's usually what happens when someone when the fireman runs into a fire there is that there's that point of just I don't know what's going to happen that's why I'm doing it like
[49:32] that's why I I that's why I'm doing it it's not because I know you know it uh yeah cool stuff um I have a lot more I'm just trying to
[49:50] I don't want to bore you guys or give you too much I want to uh I hope someone will correct me on this but okay so so getting if we come back to the uh I thing a little bit here I
[50:06] mean to the let's go back to a little bit on Monday I W to I want to share with you this is a sidebar but it's kind of related it's at the coldest Act of our
[50:20] topic and I mentioned this guy William meard Gladstone last time he was one of the linguists uh he was the first to really start this idea of starting to notice that ancient Greek had this weird thing about
[50:33] color and this guy lived an interesting life uh he was prime minister of United Kingdom uh for two years like I said before that he was a scholar of ancient Greek which is how I met him I didn't
[50:45] know he was a prime minister uh he had a nickname of gum Gom and people called him the grand old man and then people who didn't like him called God's only mistake which is is kind of funny so he uh he sort of was
[51:00] had two sides of the aisle there and they named the Gladstone bag after him that little doctor bag that that people like this guy's I mean you know I don't know what you have to do to get a bag named after you and I I looked it up it
[51:13] turns out uh Edward Duell was a French uh man who wanted people to uh have a better way to carry their gym clothes back before before gyms had been invented so uh duel invented the duffel bag which we I'm just that but but yeah
[51:27] so you know it's that's kind of cool that there's a whole bag culture out there but uh this Gladstone chair is actually it's a a Greek chair in Liverpool this guy he lost his finger reloading a gun once but but this I know
[51:41] these are random facts but but this is this tells me this dude is lit as  William Gladstone really hated opium because of his sister's abuse of
[51:54] it his sister was abusing opium and so he hated the opium trade and even though he hated the opium trade he he was admin in his opposition to the opian
[52:08] war when I read that I was like well if he hated opium why is he in opposition to the Opium War because surely the Opium War would be a war against opium right I mean come on it's not like we would have a government that
[52:22] would be like secretly doing one thing and mean no that wouldn't be it and then I found this and maybe you guys know this I'm going to assume most people don't so I'm just going to go with it but holy holy cow I can't believe this happened I cannot believe this happened

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
52:36] in history and we're all just like whistling like yeah everything's fine everything's normal the Opium War 1841 so China says look opium is
[52:53] horrible China is like opium is horrible we we do we are not proud of opium we are stopping opium we do not want opium it's killing our people it's killing the
[53:05] world it's awful we have now made opium trade illegal if we find a boat in our Harbor that's carrying opium says China that boat is ours you in your opium
[53:19] trade if you're a pirate you do not come to China to do business and the East India Company was like no no no that we no we we want the Opium to flow
[53:35] now they did not actually say we want the Opium to flow flow they are claiming that the reason why they were attacking China for trying to stop the Opium is because China wasn't paying them for the ships that
[53:48] they were capturing that had opium and I'm telling you this now I know it's a sidebar but keep in mind that this is January 7th 1841 and in 1841 this is kind of How
[54:07] It's related to melon by the way your a country's pul Hulu a country's melum a country's Radiance is going to want to look a
[54:20] certain have a certain Splendor to it it's going to want to look like a bunch of good guys that are just trying to do good right trying to help our king or God save the king or God save the church or you know God saved us or God saved them
[54:36] or whatever you we even go to other countries and kill them because we're trying to save them it's it's we we're brilliant at this we we we this is why it's Radiance that's how brilliant we are at it it's this constant
[54:49] struggle and in 1941 as as we were as as England I don't mean to say we I feel like it's probably was me that as as as another country was trying to stop opium we were like no
[55:03]  that we want the opan to flow and I start to think about why we would want that and it starts to come back to how would you maintain control of your people how would you maintain a some
[55:18] sort of cultural control over something and it it starts to look at how do you raise humans what what kind of humans do you want to raise what kind of crop of humans do you want to raise is is what I'm getting at do you want them to be
[55:33] really really powerful how much melum do you want them to see how much fear do you want them to have and I don't know the whole politics of this I I I really don't this is brand new I feel like I'm I'm even ignorant I'm afraid to even say these because
[55:48] I've just I've read this and I'm kind of like this is impossible but it's not this is what we do 5 years after this happened actually 15 years I just want to remind everybody that when this happened 20 years later uh London
[56:02] opened Reuters and New York opened AP news and that the whole melum began to flow from a centralized source of
[56:14] information and even now all the AP yes Monday I opened I was like I want to see what's on the AP news wire and I did and
[56:26] told me that uh the the all of the blacks in the world are nervous that Biden is not going to deliver on his promises that he made last time and that
[56:41] they are not going to be delivering as many blacks I'm not making this up to thock okay that part I'm saying didn't actually say thock but they're not going to be delivering as many blacks to the
[56:54] party as they did last time because Biden's promises are not being and then it showed stats saying that it's divided that last time it was 51% of the blacks and this time it's 49% of the blacks and I I want to remind you what we talked
[57:10] about about gambling that if you want to keep people watching a coin toss it's going to have to be a 5050 thing it's it's just the only way to do it that the entire time while I was reading that story none of
[57:23] that is true there's not there there's no there's not a bunch of people that are black that are hanging out in the middle of this like ramp and they run over here then they run over here in fact the story disagreed with Itself by
[57:37] saying it was 49% now it's 51 it's it's it's impossible that politics would always be half and half it's impossible but this is what we have when we shut off our smell this is what happens we we end up being able to lie
[57:51] to each other because it it allows us to stay in the room and all that does is make more lies which means that we create Hades simply by our uh
[58:04] creativity to not look at it it's a creative act we have which seems to suggest that we understand just how valuable our witness truly
[58:19] is uh a dude that kills a lot of people almost all all the time why do they get caught they they they have to tell
[58:32] someone they they have to they need someone to to know what happened it shows you how powerful this all these powers are all this all this
[58:45] stuff is because all we did is just say who's better at at lying about their melum that's really all we did and so we end up with a Liberace like it it writes itself you could PR you could have
[58:59] predicted Hollywood politics blackmail economy the entire world of Lies what we call what we what we call the evil Elite is not evil at all it's it's the exact the only way that we could
[59:13] function if we were going to do this if we were to walk around like this all the time and this is truly who we
[59:24] are like this is the essence of who we are it's weird right it feels so normal this feels completely normal and it's not it's a different
[59:44] world I go ahead I was thinking about how um you talking about was on uh AP and how close it's going to be this time because you know what if you don't keep up with those promises what it tells me
[59:59] is that people think that their individual check of the box or Mark they put in a circle is so meaningful that their vote is so important to the process like you know Society is going
[01:00:13] to break down if you don't vote you know and I've with that I mean I used to feel that way too like totally I was like you better vote hard and I'm like wow just the the amount of calories that takes
[01:00:25] from your your your your your essence right it's just like this Mass section and um you know closing that up and then holding that energy that's so powerful right now within ourselves is very I
[01:00:39] would assume sparkly know just to be able to hold that field and do it with you know because you've been there you've done that you've you know you've grown you alchemized you don't really necessarily like choose a party per se
[01:00:54] you see what the game is and you know just all you can do is really observe and just like you know keep your uh just kind of be steadfast and in where you stand you know and then that's very it's a very rare quality to have in this
[01:01:07] country right now and uh you know how we emanate that just as we walk through town who knows what we look like when you're just not holding the field of if this person wins I'm leav you I don't know what I'll do like that's little what people are saying I'm like wow yeah
[01:01:22] so powerful because they gotta check that box so hard such a ride it's beautiful because it creates a tide and people like us who who are
[01:01:36] making our own tide really can appreciate that that all the people that that would be too terrified of melum have this this kind of tide that they can participate in and it lets them kind
[01:01:49] of train in that and so it it sort of creates a mass predictability like the full moon like uh St Patrick's Day New Year's Eve like why would you go out drinking on
[01:02:03] those days I mean I'm not saying you couldn't but it's just like it's after a while you you start to realize okay it's Super Bowl Sunday okay it's up here I I live in a ski town so I I I know on ML
[01:02:15] King Day the irony is hilarious by the way but on ML King Day all these people are going to show up at once and they're going to be like can't believe is so crowded it's just like yeah it's it's it's it's almost like it happens
[01:02:29] every year huh and they're like yeah and and when you at one point you could get mad at that and be like that sucks but really it's kind of beautiful because now you know you know where everyone's going to be you know where a certain a
[01:02:44] certain group is always going to be I'll put it that way you know that there's always going to be these keys jangling and you're going to know who's who finds that captivating and that that really really does separate you from from a
[01:02:58] giant part of the world that allows you to navigate because you're able to out simulate them because they're not going to understand that the world doesn't hang on this the the the Pulu
[01:03:12] right the melum of of this candidate is too strong to allow me to take my eyes off of him therefore it must be important it must be life-threatening to the survival of democracy as we know it
[01:03:26] that kind of thing yeah it's uh it's better this way if it was chaotic if it was chaotic there'd be a lot more witch burnings if it was if it
[01:03:39] was just allowed just it would just be more random is all I I I don't think it's worse or better I'm just saying because it's a controlled burn right 444 five 444 five 444 five right
[01:03:53] now you know hey it's election year a lot of people who have no idea what they're doing are to be out driving a car right now you know and right now
[01:04:04] Biden is the nominee and Trump is the nominee and there are people that are surprised there there are people out there right now they're like I can't believe this happened what Biden and Trump were the
[01:04:19] nominees I can't believe that's happened and it's the same kind of feeling of what what happened that tag threw a chair at the other guy are you kidding me are are you saying that that wrestler
[01:04:32] hit that other wrestler with a chair this no no that did not happen no freaking way did that
[01:04:45] happen and now you know you you totally know so yeah this is uh this is why the pie Piper is good news this is why when I tell you I know it sounds awful but I swear to
[01:05:01] you this dude coming in playing that song it's gonna work out you just gotta you just got to trust me don't even trust me I'm not even the one doing it I just find it kind of cool that someone else is doing it because I I'm not even
[01:05:13] in that business I'm more like I'm bbo Baggins I want to smoke pot and write  in a book like that's about the gist of how much effect I want to have on the world you know but uh yeah turns out there's a pipe Piper that comes by
[01:05:28] and the song is really really simple it's it's seriously could not get more ice cream Chuck than this it'd be like a lactose intolerant hyena and all you got to do is just run an ice cream trunk down the road right he's just like oh my
[01:05:42] God there's ice cream it's like but your Lu shut up I'm going up you know and it's like yeah so it's a funny world yeah I like to think about the the Coliseum
[01:05:58] and and then the bread in the circus and how you know you know that place is going to be packed right you know it's going to be pack so meanwhile we're like we've already been there done that we're outside of that and we're able to create
[01:06:10] collect all this energy that's basically falling from the sky that's right our own projects because let's go time to party yep 13 666 singing
[01:06:24] let's yep all of them so uh this Gladstone let me let me tell you a little bit more about this guy Gladstone uh like I said he was the first of this philologist first of all look how dilated this
[01:06:37] dude's peoples are this dude is lit I mean he's just like my sister does opium but I've never touched it it's like wow the Gladstone okay Glon reported that Homer's epic
[01:06:51] poems used aity of color terms mostly related to dark and light there a few instances where they may have corresponded to yellow red violet and indigo but not green and not
[01:07:08] blue he wrote this book studies on Homer and the homeric cage and he uh he he went into this this is a freaking $75 book but you can get on Kindle but I pulled a few quotes out that I that I
[01:07:22] thought were interesting the Kindle version is much cheaper Homer applies to the uh adjective orero or orero p o r p h y r e oos which in later
[01:07:36] Greek roughly means purple or dark red to describe blood a dark cloud a wave and a rainbow all those terms he would use
[01:07:49] this poor fos or fuos right and he uses the epith o oops wine looking to refer to the Sea which I know I've told you that a couple times
[01:08:03] but there's the word o oopes Gladstone explained this by suggesting that the ancient Greeks categorized colors mainly in terms of light and dark contrast rather than in terms of hue and then and one of the things he said is the organ of color and its
[01:08:18] Impressions were but partially developed among the Greeks of the heroic age now when he said this a lot of people were like what are you saying everyone's color blind and and uh which is interesting that everyone was like oh he's saying everyone's color blind that's impossible
[01:08:32] which I don't know why that's impossible but again it shows you what I mean you you you get into this linear thinking and then you insist you've never thought linearly in your entire life as you're linearly telling me how
[01:08:45] you've never thought that way it's this is you know this is what we do he said Homer operated in the main he tried to he tried to fix people's misunderstanding of what he was saying and he said said Homer oper Gladstone
[01:08:56] said Homer operated in the main upon a quantitative scale with white and black or light and dark for its opposite extremities in state of the qualitative scale opened by the diversity of color
[01:09:10] so it was like there wasn't enough depth in color for Homer to even consider it as an option to convey meaning and I think this really is the
[01:09:23] biggest clue in my opinion because he's he really is saying it just wasn't enough foothold in people's mind that you that you even could use color it wasn't there yet gladon
[01:09:37] speculated that the Greek of the heroic age had a less evolved color sense that prevented him from seeing and distinguishing the many colors that modern people can see easily um Lazareth gger who we talked
[01:09:51] about Monday built a lot of his work off of off of this guy um off of Gladstone and basically just went on to to just find it and more so he kind of took his work and built on it the Hindu
[01:10:04] vadas doesn't have green I mean blue zind Vesta books of the pares the Old Testament the Bible uh and the Geer took it further because guer was the one that first started to
[01:10:17] really notice you know it's not just that it's not just blue that this first it was black and white the older you went into the uh literature you saw these different
[01:10:31] shades I made you guys a graph so it's easierly me just skip ahead so Gladstone counted according to Gladstone by the way Cameron posted a uh
[01:10:42] a really good comment on patreon and I I just have you realize that that I don't know what the Odyssey says I I I don't read Greek I I I've never have like I'm not going to learn it I'm going to die
[01:10:57] way before then it it's not not because I'm it's just I have a lot to do that's all it maybe I will but I kind of doubt it it'd be cool but it's not going to happen and I don't even think that even if I understood Greek I don't think that that would qualify me to understand what
[01:11:11] it meant and I think that's what happens with Scholars a lot I think uh Cameron mentioned on one of the translations had had actually used the [Music] term was it blue Cameron you can correct
[01:11:26] me if you need to but but he actually you know had had put the word blue in the in the translations there and and he's he has just as much of a of a of a right if not more uh to say that so uh
[01:11:40] and if I haven't told you this I need to say something to you uh some of the some of these people I'm covering three people uh in this when I'm discussing this idea blue I've been researching this since the
[01:11:55] summer I've only recently started talking to you about it just so you know and the the three thinkers that I'm using primarily Gladstone's one of them geer's another one and you're about to hear about Hugo this third one that
[01:12:07] those those guys aren't even really considered like right now they're they're there's an antiquarian in my opinion there's an antiquarian pocket of information that we've
[01:12:21] missed because our sensitivities have taken over Academia and we're not able to look at things in a raw State this is a dogma of mine it's my Dogma I'm telling you this is a Dogma
[01:12:34] that I have and I noticed it I did the same thing with James Ballentine Hanny James Ballentine hany is someone I relied a lot on for aratham met because he was the only one in my opinion that
[01:12:46] was writing the truth about priapus this you know 4,000 4,000 dildos cannot be wrong if you're going to dig 4,000 dildos up out of a pit there's probably some religious history about a dildo and we should look
[01:13:01] at that and that Smith said those same things and it it's he's in he's not in good graces now people say he's wrong not necessarily about that but they just dismiss him for other things entirely
[01:13:15] and I get that we learn more but I also think that we lose what we know too I really I think that we lose things that we knew were true that we just decide can't be and just as one example I don't mean to pick on this but I think
[01:13:28] feminism is an example of that where we now are telling ourselves no there was a blacksmith were women and I'm I'm like okay blacksmith were women and they were oppressed at the same time they both were blacksmith and they were oppressed
[01:13:43] and and it's like how do we get anywhere now like how do we even talk about anything Cameron go ahead to back up what you're saying and also uh I I I provided that because I I
[01:14:00] actually am in agreement with you and I and I think the discipline of philology itself has probably uh dropped off as a discipline where you're going to find prominent academic people since probably the Nobel Prize was invented you know
[01:14:13] you just you uh now you find more linguists and things probably but you know that discipline of just strict literary research you know Finding you know and through the written word uh so I think these figures are much better
[01:14:27] than Richard L Richmond L Latimore was the quote I had done which that was published by the University of Chicago press in 51 and uh and yeah I you know that's not one of my favorite versions and I don't know a
[01:14:41] lot of versions I'm not an expert either I I call myself or well something that's not my idea but I like to say a logo file you know because makes my love for Words a little naughty and it also I'm
[01:14:51] GNA make a lot of mistakes um but uh so yes uh I think these these thinkers you're doing this is probably a more Earnest approach and a self like a passionate approach compassionate approach to philology than you're going
[01:15:06] to find in anything from 1951 especially from the University of Chicago press and yeah thank you for clarifying that too yeah on the Latimore thing and it uh actually I have it right here they
[01:15:19] uh ladimore says in The Iliad they set up the Mast again and spread on its white sails a Blue Wave Rose and sang strongly as the ship went
[01:15:32] onward and so from Latimore's perspective the colors are completely there and everything is sorry it just hit play and that uh and and I I don't know I here's what I
[01:15:47] think and this is just my gut cuz I like to have fun I think that Latimore has never even considered that blue wasn't something that we could see and because of that he's just he's just compassionating this is what I said to
[01:16:02] Cameron he's compassionating what he thinks it it should say to convey the meaning and and it's all I'm pulling all that out of the bottom of my Taurus so I I you know this is why I'm a
[01:16:17] sophist this is why I love being a sophist it's a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful freedom I have and so you know prun my lips as always and and I I hope that people will will just read these comments as Cameron you know says things
[01:16:31] as all these things I try and keep them public simply because I really want this stuff to be out Gladstone has here you know according to his translation as we just
[01:16:45] clarified that almost two in just in the Odyssey almost 200 instances of black only about a 100 instances of white and less than 10 of red yellow and
[01:16:57] green it's like really really small small amount in in in in comparison and of course elzabeth Giger who who we talked about already just kind of built on that we talked about
[01:17:12] the spee screen um and and how it's uh t let me make sure I didn't miss one little thing on uh no I got it all
[01:17:31] um which brings it to this guy Hugo Magnus now this is in order all three of these have built off of each other um Hugo came in in 1842 so you know these are like 30 years apart these
[01:17:45] guys are doing all this work and Magnus Magnus did it Magnus was coming from a very different perspective I I certainly uh certainly Hugo was was

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:17:56] interested in in philology the love of words but he was an opthalmologist before there was Opthalmology this guy was fascinated with the eyes which is why I'm like well dude this is this is
[01:18:10] Mangus Magnus way to go buddy and so he approached this from an optical physiology standpoint and he started to uh sir one of the things that he noticed in fact wait this back up so
[01:18:25] you can see one of the first things that he's famous for is his documenting of of the first uh let me see who is that let me mute that
[01:18:38] um I have to stop Shar to do that I got him James oh okay great thank you thank you appreciate it uh one of the first things that he documented was
[01:18:52] um not not that he said oh there's a vitamin SE deficiency but he he started first started to document this proptosis this uh bulging eye
[01:19:05] syndrome this idea of these eyes that kind of bulged out of the skull and I've got a a picture of of a 17y old girl from 1895 who has the what what we now call Fifer
[01:19:18] syndrome and this is another uh big sidebar I'm sorry we're going to get to Hugo manga but this seems important because this Fifer syndrome is has all of the same characteristics that
[01:19:32] I've described before in the land of the giant series I did not know about this until I read this it just was an offshoot of Hugo that if you remember my land of the giant stuff I told you that
[01:19:43] there's some certain forms of uh uh I have trouble pronouncing this word pterodactyl ISM the six fingers is one of those versions and uh cranial
[01:19:58] stenosis are two characteristics that I uh kind of talked about that anthropologically uh there's something interesting about these they're not genetic
[01:20:11] mutations they appear to be uh genetic uh history that historically we used to be a lot more this way and on that I just noticed all my radar went off when
[01:20:25] I when I read what Hugo was doing because he noticed that this proptosis uh seemed to have a similar genetic history he didn't notice that but it appears that they have the same genetic history and if you
[01:20:39] picture I wish I could have found an example this I just ran out of time but if you picture a lot of early literature that's talking about the Giants the giant was had this sort of
[01:20:53] proptotic look to to them it has this sort of essence of this other kind of creature and I I think that that I think
[01:21:05] that Hugo has just uncovered another part of this historic genetic move and what's interesting about this is the vitamin C
[01:21:17] deficiency is what would cause these kinds of things and that over time we needed some sort of packageable fruit that would allow us to have more
[01:21:31] vitamin C so that we could come out of our land of giants our era of the Giants this is completely celebrity news I just think it's interesting that
[01:21:42] Prince uh Prince his he had a baby two months old died uh died of the same Fifer syndrome that he had this I'm going to call it an archaic genetic
[01:21:56] link that's expressed inside of them and if you understand what we talked about about the Eyes by the way when you have proptosis you cannot see it's not it's barely curable meaning that even if your
[01:22:11] eyes unswell and they return to their shape there's a still good a a really good chance you're still not could be able to see and I'd like for you to imagine that if you were were struggling with your
[01:22:25] melum if your family was having trouble going outside because of how intimidating everything was this would not be a bad idea this would not be a bad move for
[01:22:38] you to develop some sort of inability to perceive things and so when you look at things like this I think that you're seeing think about the if we think about the I'm going to use the word crom
[01:22:53] Magnum just because I need word if you think about the giant the crom Magnum uh structure this if we came from a sense where the mamum was so powerful because our smell was totally off the hook
[01:23:07] totally off the chain uh it it might be the only way we could even survive is if we were just blind just completely blind just like the sloth like we talked about guy lives a hundred years doesn't use his eyes at
[01:23:20] all and that there's a lot of stories about not just being trapped in tardus but even uh you know Neanderthal was known as the one who ran on the ridge because it was brighter I'm not
[01:23:34] kidding that a lot of cultural anthrop or historical anthropologists I guess it's just all anthropology but but anthropology were were basically saying that it was then it was the The Crow Magnum it was the uh Neanderthal that
[01:23:49] that that that that stayed in the in the in the valleys in the Darkness and it was the the homo sapien sapien but the erectus the hybrid Genesis the the ones that were branching out
[01:24:03] developing a a longer skull uh a Achilles heel a hamstring the ability to Spring the ability to run these were Ridgetop Runners and that guess what you'd have more ice you you'd be more
[01:24:16] exposed to more visual data then so you could even see that the emergence up to the Ridgetop is literally the people turning off their smell turning off their
[01:24:30] smell and developing their eyesight developing their ability to look at melum and not be afraid that those two ran in tandem which means that the advancement of our
[01:24:43] species again came through the turning off of information the shutting off of that stuff which means there was a time when we saw it
[01:24:57] all we saw it all I just want if if anyone's new and you haven't seen some of my older work this sagittal craniostenosis is one example ainan it seems like had the same thing and and
[01:25:10] one of the big cues on this is that the the cranial sutures the the seam in your cranium uh merges and the merging of that scene causes uh it's it's just a completely
[01:25:24] different species that that seems to just be uh uh mingling with us Mangus brought this home and included all of these languages
[01:25:41] now come in which I I already discussed earlier and I don't have the slides ready to to even go on more so I'm going to stop because I'd rather them just just be looking ready this is just as far as I've
[01:25:56] gotten um and I wanted to tell you a little bit about what I'm going to try which is that I originally was going to do uh I was trying to like get all this ready and do a live stream Monday and
[01:26:09] what I want to try instead is uh take like the next three airships Monday Wednesday and Friday and maybe just pull pull Clips out and turn that
[01:26:23] into a the public show so I'm kind of like reversing the order because it it it does allow me just to keep I just love digging into this stuff even more so you know basically be combining all those so I I want you to know that you're going to be seeing kind of bumpy
[01:26:37] stuff like this where I haven't necessarily finished I hope that's okay but it's just that what I loved Monday always happens uh you know people bringing up topics that I haven't necessarily thought of and then I'm doing more work
[01:26:50] on that and then I'm able to bring that so I think this is a better way to to to do it we're either putting the cart before the horse or the it doesn't matter I don't care how you do the analogy but yeah we're uh we're
[01:27:02] switching that up too so um I think that's all I it's probably all I'm going to cover today um there's definitely more um but it'll be better when it's all summarized I think oh and actually
[01:27:17] we're we're good on time this is a good time I didn't actually notice what the time was so yeah anybody uh got anything uh just I wanted to say like about you like saying the bouncing around or whatever it's kind of more or less why I
[01:27:31] feel like I'm here behind the scenes is kind of what I wanted to see anyway so I I think it's like a beautiful thing like a yeah I love the present like the way you present all the time always loved it
[01:27:43] but I also like to be here to see you I don't know uh organic I guess yeah yeah there's a lot of most of it is sidebars that that are like why are you talking about this now which is which is makes
[01:27:58] conversations fun so like I said I I yeah we we I'm sure I'm speaking for everyone when I say we appreciate well thank you James yeah I I think this will work out well especially uh if you don't have time for the airships you know it's
[01:28:12] a good chance that all those will be summarized whenever that so I don't know when the Hades episode will come out it'll basically something will be called why we don't see the color blue uh but I haven't even talked about the anatomy yet I mean we we briefly touched on the
[01:28:25] phobia but I've got a lot more uh visuals for that too and stuff so yeah they'll there'll be more coming I'll probably finish Mangus up assuming that this is done by Friday and uh then I'll be editing that and then uh I don't actually have to release that though
[01:28:39] because talking to reptiles 4 will be next talking to reptiles 5 will be next so really I have sort of two weeks um until I sort of need to have something else released publicly so
[01:28:52] Monday in my mind I thought oh I'm live streaming again but then I sort of like Revisited that and thought about it and I was like no I think this is the better way to do it so and I could change that tomorrow I have no idea but uh but yeah I I love to share this organic stuff as
[01:29:08] long as you guys don't mind the bumpiness because it to me it's not bumpy as long as you don't mind the sidebars but there are some weird sidebars I I must admit it takes you into weird places but this is what always pays off for me because of work I
[01:29:20] did seven months ago where it this is how it always happens the the I remembered melum only because 12 months ago I came across the word melum because honestly I I looked up something wrong and it showed me Samia and I was like
[01:29:34] melan melanin and Samia and I stopped what I was doing and did that and then forgot but I did it enough to you get it you know I burned the Ingram burned the constellation all right well like oh go
[01:29:51] ahead Cameron go ahead I just I'll be as quick as possible just to say that uh I appreciate you giving me feedback on that blue and the reason I shared that today is because like you said uh you know about the power of imagination uh or you know wanting to grow imagination
[01:30:04] you know I I believe in these ideas uh uh and uh but still you know I I just know how powerful and elucidating they can be when you first approach them and but it's still hard you know people out there have a hard time accepting the
