[03:28] oh oh welcome my friends feels a little early doesn't it that old time change I guess it's cliche to talk about it but we're here sun is out we're gonna be talking about the sun quite a bit how
[03:43] you doing Gabe welcome okay we're still a little delayed I think we can make it work though we'll just raise our hands at each other you know it might even fix itself sometimes time through there uh am I coming through okay to
[04:05] you it's a big delay I think but let's see how it Smooths out I think it's GNA be okay I have a good feeling I have a good feeling so here we are it's marvelous to mistifi all the way up to episode 28 of this which is at this
[04:20] point like half Loki shows and we're doing part two of season 2 episode three if you're just jumping in and and you never watched the other ones or not all of them don't worry I'll
[04:32] make it make sense to you we just like to use these shows as a teaching tool for the allegory of the universal wisdom tradition of the the ancient
[04:45] philosophers so because time is of the essence I mean time is the whole nature of the show we'll just kind of Jump Right In and and see where we left off let me get my screen share ready and Gabe you know just raise your hand when you when you got to get in on it and
[05:00] unless unless you've got something to say leading up you know before the recap that'd be fine I got one thought is uh the 23 right season two episode three there's some some
[05:18] DNA hail nod going on with the 23 is always a DNA and I remind people that it's also
[05:26] BC BC is 2 three so this uh and we have a sacred text that is deciding the fate of the Next Generation the next Aon to come so yeah there's some uh 23 and me
[05:40] DNA insemination of the new whatever Bitcoin on the on the future I gotta say hi to the chat real quick I see Priscilla zerath Zenith Aon
[05:55] cool name PK Zena says a word I've been dying to tell you guys about was cannibal it's like Kan and Abel yes indeed indeed it is that's a weird one uh
[06:11] so oh man this is all such fun stuff I've been getting into Dune so like that's fill in my mind there's a lot of parallels here but the books I mean anyway this is where we left off before so we got through probably like
[06:24] chronologically speaking about onethird of the content of the previous episode but it was just jam-packed this is 1893 the Chicago World's Fair and this
[06:36] episode uh left off where Victor timley has presented his temporal Loom to all the uh the investors the potential investors in his
[06:49] project so we got to just before we get rolling remind everybody some of the things that I considered to be important to look out for in this episode and as I continued looking out for them they made
[07:02] themselves very clear first of all we're going to like always talk about two particular major Arcana cards as the the main focus for the episode the real big Focus though is the sun
[07:15] card because Victor timley he's quite clearly a Kronos figure and it is my opinion I think that the system proves itself that Kronos is actually anciently the sun before it was applied as a name
[07:28] to the the planet that we call Saturn so the gatria is where the system proves itself and this episode gave me a good opportunity to show some how that works even between languages and why words
[07:41] change the way they do to match gatria values and meanings even if letters change because sometimes between alphabets letters have different numerical values powers of notation they call it so with
[07:56] Kronos uh the first big clue that Kronos is the the sun is that the letter that's attributed to the sun card is rash and rash is 200 as a value by itself but if you spell it out rash Yad
[08:11] Shin you get 510 510 that actually happens to be the value of Kronos in Greek so here's one of those examples of how words between languages you can see that they mean the
[08:25] same thing to the priesthood C Kaa uh yeah C so we're gonna we're gonna also be
[08:35] looking at 216 and 600 you know there's also something to consider that the the K uh in Kronos is 20 not 200 I'm looking at my math here I'm like that's not
[08:49] right so 20 plus 100 plus 70 plus 50+ 70 plus 200 is 510 just so everybody doesn't get confused by that I accidentally made the Kappa in the slide 200 but it's actually 20 so the math checks out it's like the cough in Hebrew
[09:06] but yeah we're also going to be considering the number 216 we established the relationship of 216 in the previous episode where that number existed in between the numbers of the
[09:17] two years that the episode is set in so that would have been 1868 and 1893 you multiply the digits out of those and then subtract the products and you get 216 we're also going to considering
[09:31] 600 because that's a a huge solar number and we'll see all the H uh 600 is another really big deal I think it's see what where where did that come from I
[09:45] think that's the the products added together actually and 216 comes from the magic square of the Sun and 1893 multiplied together yeah that's how it is 1893 1 * 8 * 9 * 3
[09:58] is 26 and the value of the magic square the sun uh 6 * 6 * 6 that's a 216 so Zenith says you guys changed my life
[10:11] and it's like Zen and Ken very good and yeah and then the products added together gives us the uh the 600 so those are important letters numbers also the uh meaning of rash is like Ras it
[10:25] means head or person or first it's the highest it's wisdom it's the leader it's the rabbi it's the father lot of important meanings to rash as well as the other card that we're looking at as hey doesn't have as much gatria
[10:40] mysticism going on because the number five is a little limiting but it does show up especially the concepts of the Star Card uh like electricity and interconnection and Technology things like that very big part of Illumination
[10:54] the Stars you know when you look at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair it was all all lit up with the theoretically allegedly new technology of light bulbs in a way that the stars were dimmed by the
[11:08] artificial stars of all the bulbs on all the buildings so we'll be looking at that and then the value of rash and hay put together is 205 so 205 is also relevant in
[11:21] particular because rash plus hay is a the sign for Aries in the Hebrew notation or is a sign for Aries meaning the the lamb you know the
[11:35] springtime and that we that's kind of where we left off in the previous episode uh because we established how Victor timley versus he who remains the Kronos figure in his winter form he who
[11:49] remains and his Springtime you know spring chicken brand new form as Victor timley they're like the Two Goats of the temple the scapegoat for the the uh Capricorn version the winter version
[12:03] winter solstice and the victim because that's what victim means it's the the sacrificial offering the first three letters of Victor timley of of his two names viic and T you get victim right
[12:18] there not just it's too good it's too good so our heroes are starting off where we are at here wanting to bring Victor timley back to the T VA because as I said he's the Holocaust he's the
[12:31] sacrificial victim and uh you know that's also why the original he who remains is outside of the TVA even though he runs it he's at the end of time he's like the outcast right we we should also add that
[12:45] Jonathan major the guy who plays these these two characters he's been fully scapegoated he's completely fired uh he's no longer going to be king who knows what they're going to do with their interwoven Marvel
[12:59] those but he's the real life scapegoat yeah yeah so I love what you've discovered out of the anagram of his name it's victim later victim later because you take the
[13:17] you know the first syllables put them together and then you put the second syllables you put them together and it's victim later now this is where there is double implication because at the end of
[13:29] this episode we will see the carcass of this victim later on in the film however it becomes very Transcendent because we happen to know about the actor who
[13:43] becomes a victim later in reality and so the The Meta Echoes and the layers of the Babushka are really signifant uh significant so yeah I'm glad you found the victim
[13:57] later uh yeah cuz it does it unpacks uh and it probably will continue to like what happens when that actor dies like the nature of his death is probably already foreshadowed in this in these series we just haven't seen it yet
[14:12] because that headline has not been introduced to the Zeitgeist yet so yeah we're probably treading on a lot of foreshadowing for that guy's you know the actor's actual fate and the PK wants to know if we got
[14:26] any juicy Deets on his firing I mean if you want to look into the Hollywood tabloids I kind of just scanned them to see if it was a thing but it has to do with uh being convicted of some kind of like assault or abuse charges to a lady
[14:40] he seems like a a bit unhinged it comes through in his performances you know it's like one of those things where I don't think he's acting he might just be crazy but you know who knows he can't trust any of these like
[14:54] Disney uh folks or actors although I kind of like Tom Heston the guy who plays Loki seems legit but you never know so in uh what follows next is after
[15:06] Victor's given his big oh go ahead I just wanted to mention on the rash I think it's a very significant aspect of this episode um because the uh the world's faires are where people went
[15:24] to get inspir inspiration it's where they got their head filled up with ideas and there's something about this rash it's the rushing intake of breath
[15:38] it's also the moment when Adam and Eve had the the scales removed from their eyes it's as though they had seen the the heavens for the first time and so there's a gasp there's like
[15:49] a that is the spirit of filling you with ideas and so the rash is so significant in the inspiration of the World's Fair uh and it even has to do with the um the hot
[16:04] air balloons that they fill up with a with a a a negative buoyant energy that allows them to fly at all so the rash of inspiration is also what happens to the hot air balloons so I just wanted to put
[16:19] the hot air balloons back on the map if anybody forgot from the last time that's very significant what you say is is really pertinent indeed because you can look at
[16:29] rash as being related to the idea of um the ruak you know it's a very close word s sounds or sh sounds can easily philologically change to a A or a c
[16:44] sound so rash and ruak definitely related ruach is the the spirit so in terms of the like the the interesting duel nature of putting the sun in the Star card as the things we're analyzing
[16:58] most close thing this episode it's like the rash is the the gasp you know the inhalation of in Wonder and then the hey is like the whoa hey you know the exhale
[17:11] of uh when you're in awe so you're absolutely right about that 100% right and there's other yeah there's other ruach things that will come through it's almost like we're uh we're
[17:26] disambiguating the o Wilson's wow we're actually embodying the wow on this episode the wow factor now this one this one will give
[17:42] you some wow I think so he's given his big presentation about his temporal Loom and his free energy time manipulation device and the crowd of interested parties including Ren Slayer competes
[17:57] for his attemp ention and we're then told that his device is a prototype he's talking to a robber baron that's a very like historical archetype as well in fact like you said with uh filling people's heads their rash with
[18:11] wisdom or information in the world's fair that seems to be the whole purpose of the World's Fair was to create The Narrative of history of America and and what other places and peoples were like I'm not saying there was like a complete
[18:26] societal reset but if there was the World's Fair totally fits as a thing that you would do to to set the stage again to like reset the table with all the the brand new humans and what they're supposed to think about the
[18:40] universe it totally would fit so one of the things with uh the number 200 that the letter rash represents it's very he's he's talking about his prototype
[18:54] and a similar word to prototype would be archetype and this is significant to our analysis as Victor timley as the sun because Adam the archetypal man or the whole body of
[19:08] the universe as the whole body of God is called by more modern occultism Adam cadmon which reveals the connection between Kronos Adam and the sun with the the value of 200 or the letter rash and
[19:21] Adonis because cadmon equals 200 the name the Greeks gave to the Phoenician the mythical Phoenician that gave them the alphabet was Cadmus in
[19:33] Hebrew qdm same first three letters as cadmon The Giver of letters is the logos of course you know that's uh always an often an attribute to the gods of aloquin the Hermes the Mercury Odin
[19:47] getting the runes you know even ad and Adam OD and Odin you know Adam is also Adonai or the ancient author stus
[19:58] stephanus says that Kronos was called adanos in Greek so there's your Odin Adon adanos and the Latin would terminate with with M so adanos becomes
[20:11] Adam so Kronos is Adam and he further says that this Adonis adonus it's Ada in us it's exactly the same as the Phoenician Adonis that he was the son of Heaven and Earth so now contemplate the
[20:26] Hebrew Old Testament using the word adoni to refer to God where in the English translations they simply put God or Lord as the word the archetypal man is the first image or body the Prototype
[20:40] and so now you understand the mystery that cadmon would be an epithet of God and it is in Hebrew my interpretation of all this is that the original system Poss or a a branch of it held that the
[20:54] entire Cosmos was Adam the firstborn son Son of God or that the son is Adam the Su n of God s o n of God or mystically both because the union of Heaven and Earth describes our life in between both
[21:09] and another interesting bit of math to consider back to prototype is the Hebrew word for Prototype it equals 168 which is the value of 24 * 7 that would mean
[21:21] 168 hours or in a week so the week is like the Prototype of Cycles you know what I mean it's a in the archetypal man Kronos Adam is the Prototype of course if you add
[21:35] hey uh meaning the to cadmon it becomes 205 the archetypal man we'll see more of the 205 later in the episode so there's a lot to that and we'll just look at
[21:49] this uh at truskin ashbox right here this is an at truscan artifact depicting the Battle of Cadmus with the dragon from supposedly from the 2 Century BC now Cadmus is the mythical founder of Thieves and also like I said The Giver
[22:04] of letters but here he shown in the at truscan ashbox defeating a dragon very much like St George or or Archangel Michael other typically solar archetypes that are the Dragon Slayers in myth
[22:18] which lots of reasons for that and remember that Cadmus is the founder of Thieves because we're going to get into the Fanatics of Thieves later in the episode 2 but this is a really cool
[22:31] artifact so next we see timely talking to his Robert Baron who says no I was thinking along the lines of a partnership and he says nope I don't do Partners well that that's perfect for
[22:45] the analysis of timely as the son he doesn't do partners because he is soul s so soulless the alone one yeah makes sense that this moment though he starts
[22:58] taking bids and I just thought it was a little strange because here he is is a he's a a black man getting bid on by wealthy whites I don't know if we're supposed to think something of that but seems like he's enjoying
[23:11] it seems like it's going well for him that's an interesting point yeah uh there's definitely a bit of a vanity aspect of it that's very interesting
[23:31] now this uh one of the bids the the robber bearon he's like pushing aside the the plant who was in the crowd timely had a plant in the crowd
[23:44] and used to call him a horn swagler which is kind of fun because first of all horn swagler is a term to indicate trickery or deceit but a horn is the qrn that's the root of Kronos we'll see
[23:57] more more of that later uh then we have this is fun Loki ends up stepping on the foot of this big brutish man the stepping on his foot is
[24:10] equal to saying his shoe was stepped on but the shoe has the same value 200 as rash the word is like Nim it's something like that in Hebrew the pronunciation is always tricky but it's same as the sun
[24:24] or rash the head so you you know your foot and your head connect to each other that's the archetypal man that's the Zodiac man Pisces to Aries but also the
[24:37] shoe is along with the sun it is a symbol of the Motive Power or that which causes motion because the shoe represents the ability of movement also wanted to add that in the
[24:50] heliopolitan cosmology in Egypt atom which is the same word as atom atom or atum the Creator created the inad or the nine divines including the sky goddess n
[25:05] and the Earth God gab because gab and N were locked together in Intercourse nothing could exist upon the Earth because there was no space between the Earth and the sky so shu is the god that
[25:19] separated nut from gab allowing manifest reality to emerge through Duality the Greeks Associated Shu with Atlas whose name is basically Addis which is the same as Adam oddly it's our shoes that
[25:33] separate us from the earth as well you know like our physical shoes so here's a a old piece of sculpture that basically shows Shu in a similar posture to a
[25:46] atlas fun times there now now we see the trickster timely and the plant he had in the crowd it was his own controlled opposition who he had prepared with a a tough question or a bid that timely secretly had
[26:04] planted so that he could seem genuine and respond to the logical criticisms I forgot what this is called in rhetoric though it's like a a Greek tactic where you plant somebody in the crowd I think Gabe will know what that's called but
[26:18] it's interesting because he conceals the money uh that he was given by the bidder in this guy's hat which is like another reference to the rash or the head since that's where you put hats he wisely puts it in the rush
[26:34] totally the uh yeah you're right I think it is a plant when you put a somebody in the crowd to say something that you anticipate that actually plays into your
[26:45] agenda and makes you you know look look like you're uh Mr on the ball um there is a great amount of like insider trading language going on in this scene
[26:59] because you mentioned the bids and uh I think it was uh seven buar who mentioned how we have a Joe bident and uh Vladimir Putin and so the two power players on
[27:14] the global stage are Poots and bids which is uh the stock market uh nod uh right the puts versus the bids and uh
[27:28] and then sure enough they go from I think the first bid was 500 and then the final bid was a thousand so there's a five and a one going back to our five and our one earlier
[27:39] um and I think it's also there's tipping of hats there's a lot of tipping of the Hat going on here which is uh table talk right Tipp in your hat is actually
[27:51] inside uh only those who know speak the sign language of tipping the Hat and in fact in some old western communities if your Elder crosses your path you're
[28:06] supposed to remove your hat all the way and give some honor to the veterans who gave you this land under your feet who came before you so that and also when a lady walks in the room when a lady walks in the room you all stand up and offer your chair and take off your hat and you
[28:20] know show some damn manners you freaking heathens so yeah all of the Hat etiquette is really pronounced because Abraham Lincoln the whatever the giant Abraham who gets disappeared he
[28:33] literally flips Loki's hat off chance have you ever had somebody knock your hat off in disrespect has that ever happened to you like real legitimate disrespect I don't remember nothing that
[28:47] sticks out but maybe it's happened you want me to pull up your image Gabe go ahead it is it's worse yes yes yes so when somebody knocks your hat off in disrespect it is worse than being
[29:02] punched in the face because it wasn't anything significant it was symbolic and because it's symbolic because it's artistic it's uh it has a
[29:15] plausible deniability so they're not knocking your hat off but it is symbolic of taking your head off it literally is like I remove your head but nothing really happened this is just
[29:28] theatrics and so the plausible deniability of theatrics is the p is The Pinacle of subversiveness and this is part of why I changed uh my my channel from the Slick
[29:42] dissident shared learning experience I've altered it to the shared artistic expression because art has more subversive power and that artistic sub
[29:57] ver of power I think is going to be one of our greatest weapons in our own arsenals so yeah when he gets his hat knocked off the hat doesn't come back it's gone for the rest of the of the episode uh that's actually an
[30:11] interesting symbolic uh nod a tip of the hat is going on and then sure enough that when victor timley goes and pays the guy he pays him under the hat so there's all this like
[30:24] gentlemanly uh the word gentleman in in Latin is cabayo the word gentleman in Latin literally means like cowboy so yeah there's a lot of cowboy talk in the signs and symbols of this uh room full

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
30:38] of bids and puts in the market that's going on here oh you cabero if you just do the BP switch which would happen you have a Copa it's your cap gentleman is
[30:50] the guy that wears the cap good stuff maybe the fact that this episode has has to do with like the birth of the Sun and Aries that the the
[31:04] Hat not coming back is you know he got the clip he got the old just was born yeah you know clip the
[31:14] tip yeah totally yes you know um in Aries is the percus constellation and he's holding the Medusa's head and a purse the the red blooded sack that he
[31:28] kept her head in so yeah the The Tipping of the head uh the rash the head of Medusa is totally in Aries that's very appropo and then yeah this guy he gets
[31:41] disappeared he gets disappeared and uh reappears in that Pig's car the pig's wagon that we saw earlier um there is a great deal going on with that whenever I see pigs
[31:55] symbolically invol in sacrifice my mind goes directly to Spain and the the mythological value of the fact that the Hebrew altar of
[32:09] Gibralter is a uh is a point of uh contention uh it's also that 37 degree Mason Dixon line which PK has pointed out history has moved the U Mason Dixon line to
[32:24] 39 uh it depends on who you ask and you ask PK is right uh it is actually recorded at 39 and here we are in in 1893 the nine and the three is very
[32:37] significant but I just wanted to say the crossing of boundaries this tipping of the Hat was one transgression too much but it's symbolic it's not a real fight and so uh the fact that he responded
[32:49] with uh theatrics might be telling us that most of War most of all hisory historical confrontation is theatrics it's smok and
[33:02] mirrors well it occurs to me now that the Greeks Associated the god Aries not exactly the same as the sign Aries but there's connection with the boore and in
[33:18] fact that's how Adonis died you know Adonis was killed by a boar that some said was actually the god Aries transformed in is the God of War so the pig is the domesticated
[33:35] boar and not also you know you could even make a case that rash and Aries are like an anagram for each other if you pronounce the S like Greeks often do oh yeah it would like arish nice nice that's totally
[33:53] there totally there something else that that's there we have uh back to our 216 and our 600 first is we're seeing Rin layer here these females Miss menet and
[34:07] ren Slayer are like the oracles and the Yoni power they know the secrets of the holy of holies and that's what this word uh DV iir in Hebrew which I think is
[34:20] probably like dier or connected to that rout uh div daa that that's a two 16 it refers to the Yoni the holy of holies the female oracular power but then
[34:31] there's this word uh MIM Yin nun cof Tav yeah Minot mqu I don't know how they pronounce it but it's a wet nurse but it's also biblically or poetically
[34:48] the idea of the bowl for Libations or the sprinkling vessel like a baptism water vessel or a Holy Grail so you know what do you do after the baby is born in the Zodiac the baby
[35:01] being born is possibly you know you could consider the New Year born at the Spring Equinox with Aries they you baptize the baby right and they're basically planning to anoint Victor timley as their future Messiah uh in a
[35:16] way you could consider her like a wet nurse because she nourished him when he was a child with wisdom by providing Victor timley with the TVA guide book there's also a correspondence with the
[35:29] hey or the star card number five as the idea of a door or a gate or a division because there's one word betb Alpha like BBA it can have a meaning
[35:44] referring to in a time to come in the future because the gate indicates a transition from one state to another this is a mystical correlation between rash and hay 205 because rash means
[35:58] wisdom and words for a gate which is what hey can mean in Greek is uh pile and in Indian Indian or Hindi it's pulle which are both phonetically am matched
[36:11] to the the pal Palace which is wisdom so there's all this like all this phonetic linkages that connect these two concepts really closely the gates and the the
[36:25] wisdom and the gate and that is also in Aries that the gate to wisdom is in the head it's the third eye that's the portal that's the gate the the pile the pulle all of the
[36:38] above so we have the The Tipping of the hat and Loki after he gets his hat knocked off he uses which was not a wise decision speaking of rash uh he does a
[36:53] wondrous deed and causes the guy to disappear and a cloud of fog and Mist so there's a phrase that means like astonishing miraculous Marvels and wonder wondrous Deeds that's a 600 and
[37:07] then there's an obscurity or fog or Mist phrase that is a 600 so that's kind of fun you know it's like the the hidden the hidden Miracle of the cycle of time definitely
[37:24] there totally totally you know um while we're talking about hats and tipping the hat and knocking hats off and making a a show of things I think the theme of the circus is really
[37:39] strong with this episode because we're coming up on the the wheel of the ferris wheel so the circus is also intrinsic to the episode but this I
[37:53] see having to do with the year that we're on right right now with the presidential uh uh Onslaught on our Horizon the term for uh for putting your
[38:05] name in the ring uh that is the that's the technical term for uh putting yourself out there as a presidential candidate and now I want to compare RN Slayer in this episode I want
[38:20] to put her in the position of Michelle Obama and the fact that she's about to approach uh Victor timley and make a Make Her bid for this gentleman's
[38:35] situation I'm going to evolve her for this episode into this star card because the star card is very correspondent with uh Michelle Obama uh coming on the stage in a for
[38:48] the sake of provocation it doesn't matter if she's going to get it or not it Just matters if she pisses people off and the fact that you know we're supposed to believe that Putin is so
[39:00] offended by transgender people that he might nuke us and the chance of people being like Oh yeah let's see a nuke us come drop your bombs buddy uh I think
[39:12] Michelle Obama being a trigger to try to pretend like Putin gives a [ __ ] about that symbol is very uh provocative so I just want to put Ren Slayer in the context of Michelle Obama
[39:27] about to put her hat in the ring so to say in this EX in this exact moment and that is a she is a vessel uh these cups are vessels of animosity and
[39:39] vitriol and yeah all of your scariest uh RuPaul nightmares coming true yeah she is a scary nightmare that's true Michelle Obama yeah I I don't even want to comment on it other
[39:55] than the irony there's irony there of threatening nuclear attack because of gays when nukes are fake and gay huge
[40:09] irony so here's the guy though he's in the big guys now what's that that's the key the key ingredient is fake and gay that's the key ingredient to all good triggers and the weaponized irony you
[40:26] know weapons are made of iron it's not lost on me that's how you say irony so I don't even know if that they're claiming that Gabe I I don't pay attention to what the they talk about I
[40:37] just read books and make podcasts but the funny thing about this guy being in the cage that previously held pigs and he's like aggressive like a boar you know and he's a boar as in a a Ruffian
[40:52] all of that which is Aries symbolism but but the one of the the Hebrew words that equals 200 like the rash is livestock so there you go livestock honestly guys I
[41:05] know you're going to see a lot of like Hebrew gatria in this episode I pretty much was able to find somewhere or multiple places in the episode that
[41:16] correspond to like every probably 90% of the Hebrew words that have the values that I laid out 200 510 205 216 5 uh 600
[41:31] those are the numbers all pretty 90% maybe more of the words that I can look up that have that from ancient Hebrew like Biblical Hebrew uh that have those values they show up in this episode one or more times so that's why I go nuts
[41:46] with it because it's like it's almost like that that's the the programming algorithm they use to write the script or something I don't know how else to put it or it's God speaking through letters and numbers or some of
[41:59] both so now though we move on to the drama of who gets to take Victor timely with them is it going to be Loki and Mobius or is it going to be Ren Slayer and Miss minutes and this competition ensues as he realizes that the
[42:12] competition for his attention uh is complicated because both parties already know each other and then just remember in the previous uh slides a few back I mentioned prototype and I said the word
[42:26] prototype in Hebrew is 168 and that's the number of hours in a week and here in this scene a guy walks up and he's like to timely I want my money back timely these trousers don't work I told you they were a
[42:39] prototype well perhaps uh I can come by next week next week next week yes fine so there it is like prototype and the week here it's mentioned the dupe is being plated by being told he'd be helped out in a week's time so that I
[42:54] didn't even know the second occurrence of prototype was coming up and I was like ah yes I was right to think so that we should be thinking about the weak very good jolly good then we see Loki having the
[43:07] realization that timely is a con man a confidence trickster And Timely puffs up his chest like literally grabs at his chest and he's like luminary is the word you're looking for a luminary you
[43:22] say what's the greatest luminary is it uh the solar luminary and is confidence a solar plexus trait that he's puffing up right now with confidence and holding
[43:35] at his chest I think so I think so indeed they understand each other he says uh timely says or Loki says I never doubted it for a second and timely says
[43:47] enlightened fellows never do so as fellow enlightened fellows fellow lights solar archetypes they of course comprehend and understand each other perfectly now this about to get fun this
[44:01] is a big Goofy chase scene through all of the through a lot of parts of the 1893 Worlds Fair which by the way they did a great job making sets for this show like a lot of these sets were physically built in even like some of
[44:16] the alien worlds and stuff there's a lot of creativity to that it's part of what I like about the show you feel like you're it doesn't always feel just pure CG you kind of feel like you're there in fact from what I can tell this is the you know assuming that it's accurate if
[44:30] it is accurate is allegedly the most accurate uh portrayal of the Chicago World Fair in film so that's uh that's fun for for people that find that to be one of the weirdest events of all human
[44:46] time interesting yes well you know one thing that we've been picking up on through this process oh thank you thank you
[44:57] um is that there's always an obligatory race scene right uh uh season two episode one opened with the Messier marathons where Loki's being chased and
[45:11] then the next episode was Loki chasing Brad and now here we have uh Victor timley being chased so this uh this racing aspect is uh just strangely obligatory but I just want to remind
[45:24] people about the TW uh 12th day around the clock Manhunt for uh uh John wils Booth I think we're seeing Echoes of that uh of the assassination of Abraham
[45:38] Lincoln are being seated yet again in the film which is just fascinating because we know about the threads between Lincoln's assassination and
[45:50] JFK's assassination and right now on the global stage we have a a JFK descendant we have the JFK blood is being recirculated in our language and
[46:04] JFK is embodied by the sun card and so to have the uh Echoes of the Abraham Lincoln assassination Rippling forward through the trauma Cycles onto JFK and
[46:17] splashing into reality right now is very profound because JFK Jr Jr is a one n and this is his card as far as I'm concerned and JFK Jr he Echoes back to
[46:30] uh Walt Whitman and uh in thoro this is Whitman and thorough right here basically thorough was accused to be an anarchist which has some RFK Echoes right he's supposed to be the voice for
[46:45] whatever the the rebel forces there are also Echoes into alore who is alol that is the demon star in the head in the hands of Perseus uh that is the rush that he's holding is
[46:58] Al go the demon star but their Common Thread is environmentalism thorough was a spokesperson was a polymnia rhetorician
[47:11] for uh environmentalism Al Gore same mantle and now RFK is holding the head of Medusa and he's petrifying the world with the
[47:26] climate change so the consistency of the thread is complete it is complete you brought up assassination did you know that the World's Fair in Chicago ended with the assassination of the
[47:45] Chicago mayor bum just let that hang it's pretty good isn't it say it again who that cut out say it again it cut out right when the Chicago Worlds
[48:05] Fair in 1893 ended with the assassination of the Chicago mayor not to mention the World's Fair in the Pan-American Exposition in 1901 the
[48:18] World's Fair in Buffalo New York uh William McKinley the 25th president was assassin or shot I don't think he was killed but an anarchist shot
[48:30] him even the 25 is important the 25th president uh being because 25 in the E 25 in the eing can be interpreted as innocence or sacrifice so the 25th president being assassinated or shot
[48:46] makes perfect sense wow that is amazing wow I did not know any of that what a heck of a thread that is a power power power
[48:59] weave well I just love how you pick up on threads psychically you know you're like John wil's Booth we're talking about yeah we're we're definitely you're you're in the ethers or something but I thought it was
[49:12] fun that he's hiding behind this pillar let's see where am I at my notes so the Rober Baron comes out with his goons to try to catch conman Victor timley and we see this doorway behind him which is a hay and we see a lot of
[49:28] clear doorways and windows being used as doors so that's part of where the hay of the Star card comes in and particularly because you see how it's illuminated with light bulbs that are like stars so
[49:39] that is a thing now he's hiding behind a pillar wisely palas and a pillar is a pylon so there's some phonetic connection there there's this Egyptian theme Here along with him and he's
[49:53] hiding which invokes the sense of amoon the hidden one or the Sun at noon where the uh the Shadows or the darkness is hidden but we also have this word otme
[50:05] otme which is a 205 and I think I spelled it differently transliterated it differently when it comes up later but we see a lot of throngs or multitudes or crowds um but it's very much a hay idea
[50:18] or a uh a star card type of idea because another way to understand this word in Hebrew is so much that it's about it's it can be used in context as a crowd or a multitude of people or throng but it
[50:31] also is like numbers and strength like the strength of numbers which is Aquarius is kind of like that it's the the strength of the whole made up by its parts so those two things
[50:45] and this is I really like this slide uh oh I wanted to say too about the the multitude is the how the the solar generative power in the Spring Equinox gives rise to the multitudes of
[51:00] life that spring up at the time of spring which is why the word that refers to a big crowd like they're they we see here is equal to 205 which is the the Aries
[51:12] signification rash rash the ferris wheel is like the fairy the bearer because that's what it means in Latin fairy the bearer even think of like bear and fair
[51:26] the F becomes a p or the P becomes a b there there's all this philological thing that makes you know that fairy and bearing are the same word but it's the the ferris wheel is the carrier or
[51:39] Bearer bearer of Ash fairy Ash Ash is the fire solar symbol and you have it totally Grand you know lit up all the way up the top we'll talk more about the ferris wheel later but in this slide oh
[51:53] Gabe you want to jump on I'll save it for the ferris wheel weave okay okay so first of all there's a 216 here with the the the B the guy's Raging
[52:11] Raging the robber baron that's rash VAV gel Z equals 216 means trembling with rage and anger this guy's definitely like you can see his mustache quivering but
[52:26] what's what I picked up on here that kind of tripped me out is how timely yells for assistance to a nearby vendor we'll see in the following
[52:38] slide and he yells Hugo Hugo just randomly like this is not a character in the rest of the episode so we got to think about the name Hugo so I'm going to just start with the the word in Greek Upsilon AA
[52:52] Sigma which You' pronounce Hughes this was placed on the temples of the Sun or temples tacus it's the origin of the IHS that you see in Catholicism with Jesus the
[53:06] latter the IHS being a Corruption of Upsilon AA Sigma the Hue of Upsilon Ada Sigma is the same root as in huor which
[53:19] is the Greek word where we get hydro or water so it's an indication of the solar symbolism laid up in water and rivers like Bach of bakus meaning a stream in German Hugo in German it's a Germanic
[53:34] name that has an atmology that means mind or intellect so there it is the logos idea descended from the solar deity deity Hughes or bakus the gatria
[53:46] value for Hughes oops on ATA Sigma is 608 which is an updated version of the same idea of the neuros of incarnating Saviors that the original system was
[54:00] altered from being 600 to 608 so we will look you know we'll think about 608 when we think about 600 because the Greeks basically uh updated it from 600 to 68 for what their priesthood thought was
[54:13] necessary to make all their historical revisions work out but basically pay attention pay very special attention to words with the gamat value of 608 as they pertain to the system because
[54:27] this Nero cycle of reincarnating Saviors whether it's Cyrus or uh Pythagoras or Etc like or Jesus or Muhammad this is like the The Secret Of
[54:41] Secrets of the system is this knowledge of the cycle uh an example of another word that will show you this change from 600 to 608 would be the word th which would have
[54:55] potentially been spelled f nun nun which is 600 but then you add in the AA which is the the e in Fin and you have 608 this is actually the same in uh
[55:09] let's see yeah this is the the root of the fin of The Phoenician or the Phoenix or the Irish calling themselves fenians or the word Ben in Hebrew being
[55:22] Sun as the p and B can interchange clearly Victor timley he's a reincarnated he who remains so he's a phoenix allegory a solar allegory of course to add to the symbolism here though the Egyptian themed background
[55:37] has you can just barely see it but there's palm trees here so the Palm Tree was the Bion which or the the Bon which is a the same word
[55:49] as Fen P&amp;B switch it's also like ion Bion with is which is a name for time or Kronos with the b in front so the BP swap in effect meaning the name Bion for
[56:04] Palm is the same as Fe nun nun the fin the pin the phone Etc the palm tree is symbolic of this cycle of renewal of of uh incarnations of the savior because it
[56:17] possessed the faculty of renewing itself without the process of generation or fructification like the serpent some palm trees last hundreds of years and they don't really change throughout the year like the seasonal climate trees do
[56:30] so it's a lot like what why the Christmas tree is the is evergreen trees in more Northern climates because they're both trees that pretty much just stay the same so they they're thought to self-renew they're thought to have that
[56:43] immortality the Ancients actually might have thought the palm tree was Immortal because the the author of one of the Psalms in the Old Testament of the Bible talks about the righteous Shelf flourish
[56:55] like the palm tree you even we'll see a similarity in the word Psalm and palm the Egyptians called the palm the ba or baay and they gave the same name to the
[57:07] soul ba or baay or ba and we we don't really know how Egyptians pronounce words it's also said that the holy of holies in the Egyptian or the Hebrew Tabernacle was surrounded by palm trees
[57:21] you've got the Hebrew version of this is p nun hey which is or a Hebrew version of this that's translated in the Bible about Joseph to be a word that means
[57:33] augur so there's a there's a connection to the augures because the whole prediction of the next coming of the cycle or the Savior was the one of the main reasons to have augers and Higgins
[57:46] thinks that this Godfrey Higgins thinks that this uh Hebrew p n is the same as or it's definely an anagram for the fin of of the phoenix like the
[58:00] Phoenicians there's a a quote I have here of from Godfrey Higgins and anacalypsis where he says I apprehend the palm tree or the Phoenix tree was the sacred tree the tree of wisdom for
[58:14] another reason from the use of its leaves for the purpose of writing of course you see here this isn't the kind of palm tree that has those type of leaves but some have big broad leaves that you used to write on it had the
[58:26] name of the the tree tree of the AL or om Dome the Phoenix was the M the cycle of 600 it was the ornament of the holy of
[58:40] holies of the Jewish temple of the aanan aanan the eternally renovating cycle which was one of his names in fact in
[58:51] ancient Egypt Fina meant cyclus or periodist so or aam which is like a age so cycles and periods rep repeating Cycles so that's what I have on this I'm

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
59:05] gonna pass it over that all all of that just because the Dude yelled Hugo I was like all right and there's a palm tree we got to talk about this stuff dude
[59:18] yeah yes absolutely um so it something there's a lot of things pinging for me as well when I hear
[59:29] Hugo um meaning things first of all South Carolina Hurricane Hugo was a historic catastrophe it is uh was actually uh a touchstone of the culture
[59:43] down there because it affected everybody um I happen to have lived in the wake of Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina in the Carolinian uh state
[59:56] flags are Central around the palm tree and so to hear Hugo and see a palm tree and have lived in the Carolinas before I also know that the 37 degree Marc of
[01:00:09] Mason Dixon that crucial boundary but also the Carolinian Bloodlines are signified here uh powerfully and then chance can you pull up them actually can you pull up the Wikipedia link because I
[01:00:23] want people look at this guy's face like take a mental picture of this face and then can you pull up Hugo degut in the Wikipedia link I telegram to you just pull up his picture because it's
[01:00:35] almost like the same guy uh he just needs my beard like those eyes kind of match Hugo de grut is the motar of
[01:00:49] international law and then chance can you pull up the image that I sent you that is a slick dissident original uh when I studied Hugo deg Groot I think they go ahead what if AI generated all
[01:01:04] of this Renaissance Art and all this history is totally fake his eyes are weird anyway go ahead well we definitely know that the movie is
[01:01:18] generated uh but this is this is uh kind of part of I am Groot I am Groot this this uh this root stem this RI uh
[01:01:30] romatic root stock of culture this character is the Bedrock of international law and when you take on the that the identity when you play
[01:01:43] games with the [ __ ] I fake it you are in his domain and he is the Mozart again with subversive art using art to subjugate the people so this is a a a
[01:01:57] collage from when I was researching him but here we have Hugo we had the palm tree I'm I'm saying that this guy the spirit of Hugo deg grou the moar of
[01:02:09] international law I think he is the palm of the gour he is the hand of the garur on the other side of private contract and international law and so uh there's
[01:02:23] this is a whole side dig but when you said Hugo and you mentioned the palm tree and we're talking about the contract and the uh uh The Exchange oh you mentioned that the PO is also like a bond it's also a
[01:02:36] bond right the P the paper that is a bond yes it's like my word is my bond well this piece of paper is now your bond now theal with your pals touching you're bound by
[01:02:49] yeah right right and then uh one more just a side wave well no I'll just leave it at that yeah this guy is going to be on my radar forever now because I think he is a one of their secret Patriarchs we'll just
[01:03:04] say that I think they have a secret patriarchy that so often in conspiracy culture if you hear the name often or frequently or becomes commonplace they're probably not really that meaningful and every once in a while you
[01:03:17] find a character who you're like I've never heard of him and he happens to be in a position to have influenced time and history from behind the scenes on the private side so yeah Hugo deg grut is totally on my radar big time because
[01:03:31] he's obscure that's always a clue okay you love this one man I I bet you didn't catch this because it's just barely visible in the background but
[01:03:50] we're talking about the Cycles right in this Chase seene an interesting segue we see the volcano of Kila Cyclorama Whimsical Chas just in the
[01:04:06] background what the the cyll Rama was a 360 degree Panorama of painting depicting the lava flows from this Hawaiian volcano and was a big attraction to World's Fair
[01:04:20] visitors it was like V you know it was like 19th century VR and it's appropriate that we should get at least a glimpse of that with Victor timley in the shot because he's basically a maker or Creator like Vulcan or
[01:04:37] hephestos have at it you know volcano What A Catch excellent catch yeah man uh and even the um the fact that it's a three a circle of lava makes me
[01:04:52] think of the symposium because it's a circle of Patriarchs talking about love uh but yeah excellent catch and whenever the flags are on the horizon um
[01:05:06] there's uh those are those are actually capturing your emotional energy they're capturing uh adoration Goosebumps inspiration uh they're yeah
[01:05:18] totally seating ideas nice that is so obscure great catch so the guy Hugo appears to be the name of the man with the oranges on this cart here whenever he was he who remains he's
[01:05:39] tossing an apple up and down but as Victor timely he tosses an orange I don't know is this are we supposed to think like comparing them is like comparing apples and oranges maybe to show their similarity yet difference I'm
[01:05:53] not sure but but Citrus in general is you know it's very solar of course there's that I mean the the light of the sun can be orange that's all fun now another quick Freeze Frame if
[01:06:07] you get just the right frame you can see Mobius flanked by Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show which was an attraction at the Chicago Worlds Fair this is a particularly
[01:06:20] important set piece because it helped firmly set the idea of the Wild West as we later got it in cinema into the public mind it could very well be mostly made up a theater a a theater of the Mind a way of controlling public
[01:06:35] perception of the history of America and of course it's I'm not it's not lost on me that bill is the name of the sun Bell Bale Bill and Annie is ano
[01:06:46] the year Annie and the oak oak tree that's his own big part of it too Annie Oakley and Buffalo Bill so just a a fun little catch that they make a a really
[01:06:59] brief split-second Cameo like that's the level of detail they go to the trouble of in this series why I like it is cuz you're going to get a 1 second amount of screen time but they got the whole costume they got the extras you know
[01:07:14] they didn't they weren't shy on on the details which is why I think we should take all the details as seriously as we can uh perceive them you know now this one I okay so this is where
[01:07:30] they get onto the Baris wheel Loki and Sylvie has entered the scene and she's trying to kill Victor of course so there's this tense standoff on the ferris wheel where s Sylvie wants to assassinate Victor timley who I now
[01:07:45] realize the assassination related to World fairs is actually a big deal like that happened at more than one World's Fair so it's it's appropriate that they're doing that in this show I almost
[01:07:58] went with uh there's this I could only find it in One Source but there's this Biblical Hebrew word that seems like it has the root meaning of to protect and that's what Loki is
[01:08:11] trying to do here and it's a it's one of the 216s I think or one of the 510s I can't remember which but I couldn't find any good receipts in like the strong concordance so I left it of the slides but what why I'm bringing it up is
[01:08:26] because in modern Hebrew the spelling of the word that I was thinking of it means [ __ ] so I'm like is he protecting or is he taking his [ __ ] because like his pose here sorry for my crudity but that's
[01:08:39] what I thought of uh now there's lots of fleeing and fugitive action in this episode Ren Slayer is identified by Mobius as a fugitive here and the entire
[01:08:54] half of this episode is about Victor fleeing like a fugitive so this is a connection back to our Star Card encoding because the letter hey the value of five is the same value
[01:09:05] as a Biblical Hebrew word whereas a noun it's fugitive oras a verb it's to flee so that's like a big part of this episode interesting now another
[01:09:31] goodam another good gatria dig here is this word aen Tav me which is a 510 it means to be burned and Loki's like we need Victor don't assassinate him
[01:09:46] without him the TVA will be destroyed and she's like Let It Burn and then what happens to the sacrific victim you know it gets burned of course that's what Holocaust means it's a burnt offering so makes sense
[01:09:59] that that would be in here uh the the word that I have up here it appears in Isaiah 9:18 this autom
[01:10:11] and when you think about it philologically T's become D's so autum as this word is basically Adam again there's that and then secondarily
[01:10:24] as in the context of Isaiah where the word is used it's like by the fury of the god of hosts the Earth was shaken next the people became like devouring fire not one of them spared the others
[01:10:38] so there's like the the power of a multitude and the locust swarm of it all uh and of course yeah rash is a 510 when it's spelled out that's why we're using
[01:10:51] 510 then you have a 600 in the word Shin Shin shash I guess the 600 has a poetic meaning here of white marble this is also how you spell the word six in
[01:11:06] Hebrew it's Shin Shin but the white marble is could be white linen or white marble um I mean that's this city the whole city was this white Marvel
[01:11:24] or plaster depending on if it was real or fake yeah man that is so interesting that you spell it with a Shem Shem because that's a that's just like
[01:11:37] dma the six is has some kind of strange Superstition around it uh that I can't I wish I knew more like I wish I knew a lot more because it's so pronounced but
[01:11:51] they don't even call the letter six or the number six they don't even call it by its own name they refer to it as twice three so Dima is is using a practic word to address an idea that I
[01:12:06] think the Greeks were deeply superstitious about the number six and I think they still are I think this is still a Lynch pin that it's a mystery of mysteries but you're telling me that
[01:12:19] even in Hebrew they had to refer to it as twice three Shin Shin so even there they're using a prophylactic to refer to something without it's like the the number that shall not be named and I
[01:12:33] think that the six is actually like a it's like a poison pill that they let other cultures attached to and if you're like yeah I associate to the six in various ways then it's uh you've defiled
[01:12:47] yourself and those in the know who are like yeah these dumb asses they went they accepted the six but we know better so uh in part of and it's not just the sex the sex is the psychological aspect
[01:13:00] of it I think there's something even deeper behind the mystery of it all but I just have to say that because um okay I know I sound like I know I sound
[01:13:14] crazy but chance I'm beginning to understand I'm beginning to over understand that to over understand is to be superstitious but to understand is to
[01:13:30] underthrow is to be a subject if you're subject you're saying I understand that means yes I am the subject but to be a subject mean you didn't throw hard enough sub under to throw so if you're
[01:13:45] subject you didn't throw hard enough your archery isn't very good you got to draw deeper you got to get a better draw and if if you want to get a real good shot you have to be
[01:13:57] overstanding which means you have to be superstitious and now what I'm formulating is something of a new I'm carving out the new narrative from the sovereignty movement where they're saying no I don't understand no I don't
[01:14:13] understand I don't stand under this I do not uphold what you're saying I think there is a new level of sovereignty where you say sorry dude who I don't know or recognize at
[01:14:27] all I am superstitious I overstand I don't understand I overand and so the what I'm carving out is that the new sovereignty is
[01:14:41] superstition and if you can say if you can remain superstitious you'll never get drawn into uh the liability of saying yes I understand understand because as soon as you say
[01:14:55] you understand you know you're lying you know you're lying so yeah superstitious is my new stance in life on all things I get it man I get what you're saying and I never even thought about
[01:15:10] that before the diagma for everybody to back up is a letter from the ancient Greek alphabet that was the sixth letter but it basically was like the Hebrew vow wow VAV the D the it could also sometime it
[01:15:26] looked like an F actually how it was drawn but the Dima that means G twice or gimmel or gamma twice so gamma being the
[01:15:35] third letter diagma 2 three 23 that's what they're calling six in the ancient Greek alphabet and here we have the word for six in Hebrew is Shin Shin so there's a there is kind of a diagam
[01:15:51] thing going on and that equals 600 the Greek letter that equals 600 is the which looks like an X the Greek word for for six is exie in modern Greek exy so
[01:16:06] there is something superstitious about the the six I mean it's the hex it's not just the sex it's the hex I don't think we're going to get to the bottom of it today but there's something to it something powerful yeah man and then
[01:16:21] I got to mention also the w W granted it's a shim shim but it looks to me like a World War a ww man I never thought about it that way
[01:16:37] wow makes me think of you know one thing that the shin looks like is connect it's a ww wow ww is the wow it's the wow chance
[01:16:51] we're looking at the wow [Laughter] wow we found it we found Owen Wilson's forbid and wow was not allowed oh Cheney says W is just three
[01:17:07] on its side there's something to that so let's get into the the ferris wheel a little bit being on a ferris wheel uh
[01:17:19] she's okay so sylv's like ready to kill Victor she says do you think I'm going to get any joy out of killing that man if you in the TVA hadn't messed with him he'd have remained harmless but now he's the he's going to become the thief of
[01:17:34] all free will so first of all let's anagram Ferris wheel and we get freeze wheel freeze will freas will Frey is a name for the sun you know that by the 608 that you
[01:17:47] get when you spell out F Ro he so here's an example of how words can mean the same thing or the letters change so we just talked about Finn being 608
[01:18:01] which is fe uh a nun none well two NS is 50/50 that's 100 a row is 100 so if you swap the ins for an an R essentially in
[01:18:15] the Greek system you go from fin to Frey but it still has 608 and that's why that's why Frey and Finn are both words that are referring to the you know
[01:18:28] the solar archetype and solar hero it's also possibly why there's a thing that linguists do not seem to understand and I don't have a better explanation than this that in in the rules of swapping
[01:18:42] letters one of the letter swaps that occasionally occurs is in with r and it's not like L and R where you can see how you can make that mistake just with
[01:18:55] your mouth not doing the right sound cuz they're close but in an r no they're not really similar but if you consider it that two NS makes an r in jamanta and two NS together is no different than one
[01:19:09] in in terms of the sound well then you could start spelling things one way or the other way but you're mystically saying the same thing which is probably where the NR swap is coming from so we're talking about the ferris wheel
[01:19:21] phrase wheel uh phrase wheel would be the sun of course I know and I probably have to say this a lot of times but sometimes folks don't get like where
[01:19:35] or or why I bring everything back to the Sun or I assert that the sun has like the the Primacy in the the old system you know and we we I'm happy to talk about pole star symbolism and things like that and I can see dual symbolism
[01:19:50] happening simultaneously but just erase in your head if if you can all your thoughts about and and all your cosmology about like what is the sky and what is the
[01:20:04] Earth and what is life and what is the sun pretend you don't know any of that but you've lived about a year you know as an adult and you've seen what happens in the world you know so tell me if without all of the things you've been
[01:20:17] told by other people with just the powers of your own observation and life what the heck is the son you know like if you really get into the minds of the Ancients it's perfectly reasonable to think the sun is God or
[01:20:31] that the sun is the representation of God in fact it's the most reasonable thing imaginable like there would be no lights there would be no warmth it's over it's over of course it's the creator of course
[01:20:44] it's the demuros so the there's also the possibility the sun is what sets everything in motion or is the the wheel that turn that is the will that keeps everything turning uh at least in the ancient system that was definitely the
[01:20:59] case and we'll talk more about Wheels here because I one thing that I saw in this shot you can't see it super well in the screenshot I got but Sylvia basically like pushes Victor up against the wall with magic so he's like chained
[01:21:13] to the wall by invisible chains so this is very much like an an ixion's wheel thing ixion's wheel we've talked about it in previous episod episodes but it's like the the myth of ixion's wheel is
[01:21:25] that he ixion killed his father-in-law he was reckoned as the first man guilty of kin slaying and Greek mythology Zeus took pity on him brought him to Olympus introduced him to the table of gods and
[01:21:38] instead of being grateful iion got all Lusty for Hera Zeus's wife Zeus found out about it and so for some reason he made a cloud in the shape of Hera which
[01:21:50] became known as neph like Nephilim from nephos cloud and he tricked iion into doing it with the cloud Hera from the union of iion and the false Hera came uh
[01:22:04] imbros or centauros who M with the magnesian Mars on Mount paleon according to pendar and created the race of centaurs who are called the ixan iion
[01:22:18] day from their descent ixion was then expelled from Olympus and blasted with a Thunderbolt and Zeus ordered thermes Hermes thermes that's the at truscan version Hermes to bind iion to a winged fiery wheel that was always spinning
[01:22:31] therefore iion was bound to a burning solar wheel for all eternity uh at first spinning across the heavens yadada the point being my opinion is that this Greek mythology about iion and his wheel is
[01:22:45] potentially like a middle-ages forgery cover up of the fact that the crucified savior whether on a wheel or on a cross was extant in places like Italy and the
[01:22:58] Celtic and Gish Nations and the the cians who were Kelts and all over the dang place like you remember the Brit the British getting into India and colonizing it for a while well one of the things that went down is they they
[01:23:13] and the brahin worked together like Sir William Jones lot a lot of love for Sir William Jones's work but guys like him uh scrubbed the records of Krishna being crucified because it was too heretical
[01:23:28] to see all the similarities right so I think that there's been a long-term project of the church or the ruling class to erase or confuse the crucified
[01:23:40] savior Motif in h that it existed way before Christianity Marty Gnostic Academy 33 thank you for the Super Chat always coming through with big super chats man man I'm honored I'm honored
[01:23:54] that I'm the I'm the I'm the channel that he actually watches I have high standards like him I don't like to watch a lot of stuff so but back to this uh back to this chaining of of him to the wall that's also kind of like Kronos
[01:24:08] being chained as well uh the god of time that he is but all right looks like Gabe wants to jump inbody yeah uh so the ixion and the story of ixion is totally captured in this image right
[01:24:28] here you've really nailed the moment you've captured the spirit of the uh choreography of the heavens um because notice even the arch
[01:24:38] the arched um rooftop of the CH of this uh Carousel or whatever this this room on the ferris wheel that they're moving in even the arch of the ceiling is perfect uh
[01:24:53] because get my map going here The Centaurus is right here and this is The Wheel of Fortune card it even has the axial
[01:25:06] spear spearing The lupus wolf on the end of the Spear of curus and so they're under an archway the roof above his head is even arched
[01:25:19] this is the sacred arch of the Ursa J so right now ixion is the cooks constellation that is Victor timley pinned up against the
[01:25:31] wall uh Loki is playing Centaurus itself and lupus the wolf the outcast is um what's her name uh female Loki uh what's her name again Sylvie or she could even
[01:25:46] be scorpus too back there Sylvie Sylvie because this is silver this is the wolf is is gray she is the outcast uh uh kaput Garrett
[01:25:58] lupinum he's out law he's cast out from the law here's Libra he's just outside of the law and now one thing I love about this map is that it has it
[01:26:13] actually is tracking Haley's Comet and Haley's Comet takes a second to stir its finger in the cocktail cup of the crator constellation right here and I just love

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:26:25] that Haley's Comet is like God stirring the suicide cup of Hemlock that Socrates is about to drink he's like let me let me warm that up for you buddy so yeah I just wanted to put us on the map because
[01:26:38] here in a second uh ravona is going to be playing the role of Virgo when she reclines in a chair so yeah the anatomy of the heavens is completely being expressed in this scene I love that you
[01:26:52] caught the ixion which is the crooks constellation that's the crooks of the matter of what they're fighting over is this little tiny Coptic cross under the legs of Centaurus who is Centaurus is the protector like Loki is protecting uh
[01:27:07] ixion right now and then the lupus the [ __ ] The Prostitute the wolf is uh yeah it's all there yeah in previous episodes we talked more about ixion
[01:27:22] wheel and its connection to the Dove and to semi Ramis or Isis or other Queen of Heaven archetypes so it's like we repeat some stuff but there's more there's more gravy on that in previous episodes of of
[01:27:36] the domes toi it's Rich very rich now next thing that happens is we have Ren slay asking the cartoon AI clock Miss minutes for a distraction and she inflates her size
[01:27:50] and pretends to be a ghost to scare the people away and uh what do you know fear and awe is one of the words that the uh 2116 it's Yad R uh Al hey and if that's
[01:28:04] not a direct and intentional symbol of the Holy Ghost I don't know what would be but we're going to save that I'll talk more about the Holy Ghost a little later that for sure miss minutes is the Holy Ghost in this whole allegory though
[01:28:18] it's like they they don't play around it's very clear I got something on this chance can you make me big so she is the she's the BC this is
[01:28:35] EP uh season two episode three so the BC the DNA of the Savior to come is Bitcoin and Bitcoin is is prone to climb
[01:28:51] Bitcoin gone climate change and Bitcoin is climbing Bitcoin is gone climate change and Bitcoin are
[01:29:04] karmically uh forever intertwined so the climb bit gone of climate change and the Bitcoin inflating and deflating overnight I think that just happened this week I think Bitcoin just had some
[01:29:18] sort of ridiculous throttle that then settled down to something uh a little less exciting in a matter of just a few minutes and so I think Miss minut
[01:29:31] is articulating still the high way up there yeah I I think it's fascinating that that just happened the same week with we're doing this episode where Miss minut comes out and does the clim [ __ ]
[01:29:46] Agony climate change whatever to get the to get the people moving I could see it being seasal too that we're all feeling the we're all feeling the energy go up in the the realm as we
[01:30:00] approach the Spring Equinox makes sense that the the climate change of Springtime is the the Bitcoin climb as well I think that makes sense it's interesting it's like they
[01:30:14] like they found another thermometer to fit up your ass that you didn't even know was there there's another thermometer up your ass you had no [ __ ] idea how many thermometers are you g to fit up your [Laughter]
[01:30:32] proon yeah moving on H that's hilarious it's it's true though all these different metrics uh Loki and Mobius escape on a double bicycle I just think that's funny that's why I got a screenshot of that
[01:30:47] that unfortunately you don't see them actually writing it that would have been great now the next scene is we're we're now in the interior of Victor timy's pad in
[01:31:00] Chicago and the first shot we get to establish that we're in a new scene is of this mythological AF looking fish on the wall so my first thought is like uh Deon
[01:31:14] The Phoenician fish God Deon and so I looked into deeon in my notes and whatnot and found out oh yeah deeon was the father of the Gods which is the same as Kronos or Saturn or
[01:31:26] Jehovah there's only really One Source on Phoenician mythology so whether or not that's it's you know accurate or real oh go ahead Gabe I'm having a I'm having a crazy
[01:31:44] Epiphany Deon is a SLI sophena for understand and understand is an Italian inside joke
[01:31:57] uh for capichi and capichi is the Pope's hat the miter hat is a cap pishi it's a pces a Pisces hat so capichi means do you understand the word Doan is a
[01:32:10] strange anagram for un understand so somehow capichi the fish the puns are trans linguistical chance this is like it's too
[01:32:23] profound how it's not different how it's not different we're making the same mouth noises but we're still saying uh because because the reason this is
[01:32:35] consistent is because the doans gave us understanding they granted understanding to humanity and their name is an anagram for understand I tell you what man I'm more superstitious every day I ain't
[01:32:50] understanding the [ __ ] I I'm overc everything I can't read understand out of Deon is there any way to help me do that yes not working for me yes yes it's
[01:33:04] a sophena sophena a g n yes gosh it's really okay because of the N to the
[01:33:26] r okay let me there are a few rules with sophron anagrams you can you can multiply any consonant so if you need the N to be an N it can also birth the r
[01:33:41] that you're looking for so we got the D the G and N but we also can birth a r out of this and right and then you uh with
[01:33:55] sophena uh you can repeat any consonant or you can contract the continents down to one um so yeah uh n d no it's not there you know what it is
[01:34:12] it's Aon it's the aegon is what it is it's the age the age in it the Aon is
[01:34:23] um is the uh social agreement to struggle for a common goal is uh the aegon is like the ego the the the ideal High ideal it's the light that everybody aims for is the
[01:34:38] Aon and I guess I'll I'll just leave it with that that's close enough to understanding for me but AG N is a it's actually a Greek kind of a deified word that has the word zeal and the word
[01:34:51] Victory it's the child of zeal and victory had a baby and its name was Aon and this is what everybody's going to strive towards this is the understanding of the society to work to understanding to a common
[01:35:06] understanding well deeon being the father of the gods that connects him to Kronos the time God or Saturn father of the Gods if you read the G like a a gamma that can make a a y sound then
[01:35:20] Deon you know and you say you're you're uh the d a little sharp like a t now you've got tion tion ton ion ion tone ion you know that's uh
[01:35:33] getting us very close to ion the Mobius that whole thing but uh it's also 128 that name is a 128 which is a multiple of 64 which is a very strong programming number the but
[01:35:48] back to the the mythology of the Phoenicians we don't really know because there's only one source from the ancient authors assuming that it's real felo of
[01:35:59] biblos in the uh s sanan sanchuan something like that so it's the book of Phoenician mythology allegedly and according to filo of biblos deeon actually was a word that
[01:36:16] meant grain and when I found that in my notes I was like oh oh of course that completely SNS his name to the meaning of Kronos because the Kronos comes from
[01:36:27] the root krn or qrn which is a seed or corn so bam there's that so like there Deon and Kronos have the same meaning of the word as a word outside of
[01:36:41] it being a god also when you look at the fish head it it does have a horn like thing going on with its mouth what's in the bag is it seeds and another trippy thing is like this is a
[01:36:54] colored oh sorry this is a colored version of Deon uh carving or something or relief and look at his wrist does that look like a wrist watch
[01:37:07] to you I mean must be just a bracelet or something but God of time indeed and I'll Zoom I'll make sure we're zoomed in on on the uh the pope with his fish hat of course the the Bishops are the yeah
[01:37:21] pishi the little fishes and that's actually before they were called Christians they were called Pichi and like they're the little fish of Vishnu really the funny thing is I've been going through Dune and there's this
[01:37:36] fourth book of Dune where it gets really crazy God emperor of Dune and the the god emperor of Dune is like a a a self-created Dem urge worm man yal de
[01:37:49] beath and uh he creates like the Golden Age of Saturn essentially in in the narrative and uh he has an entire priest hood that is also his military and they're all women and he calls them the
[01:38:03] fish speakers so one of these days I got to just go through all the [ __ ] gravy in Dune the books like that guy knew some stuff about the system everything's so consistent but yeah why would we see
[01:38:16] this Deon fish in the very first establishing shot of Victor Timeless home I doubt that he's into fishing so and it's a very Eastern looking fish and of course the Phoenicians would have been the Eastern arm of the Theocratic
[01:38:31] Empire that was whatever pre was the precursor to Rome possibly centered in Italy and I just think yeah Deon must be we must be getting the wink that deeon is a version of Kronos that's that's
[01:38:45] what makes sense to me oh not to mention that the Jesus fish is a the ichus which is a fish there's so many things to to deal with with all that the original IUS being potentially
[01:39:00] a six spoked wheel back to your six we could go on it just spirals out when we try to talk about this stuff yeah I like how his uh his arms kind of look kind of weird how he's he's
[01:39:19] like his his elbows are kind of overlapping it almost looks like his arms are in the shape of the tail of a fish you know the fact that they're I don't know off to the side
[01:39:33] they almost look like he's making a fish gesture with his arms yeah yeah totally and isn't that a you know Walk Like an Egyptian that's like one of The Telltale uh symbols of
[01:39:48] Walk Like an Egyptian but that ain't Egyptian so this is one of my favorite things in the episode and I wanted to just ask you Gabe why do you reckon they'd show us that Victor timley really wanted to show
[01:40:04] Ren Slayer his special invention the refrigerator chair man well I will say one thing because right now she uh ravona is
[01:40:26] playing the Star Card uh this has a strong Aquarius correspondence uh because it's uh it's in the winter time of
[01:40:36] year this card signified uh tacore the Muse of dance and I've been pondering and meditating like why is she uh why is she why is the Dan in Muse in the wintertime
[01:40:52] and what I came up with is that uh we're all dancers in the winter because we're sliding on ice and when you slip and slide on Ice you need um impeccable balance and so for her to be uh put in a
[01:41:06] position to like be wooed or wowed or impressed by his uh his refrigerator uh is kind of like she's being put on Ice in an interesting way but she also has these two cups she's got like the two G
[01:41:21] uh goblets or chales one above and one below uh so oh here we go yeah so I have her upside down in case people are wondering this is what she really looks like normally but I've put her in a back handspring for the
[01:41:36] spring uh for the leap year uh this is in honor of the leap year that happens every four years so this is a bit of a vote of offering so um but this is also the aidonis river that runs backwards uh
[01:41:50] kind of flowing against time if you're if it's flowing down like water should it actually goes against the flow of time it runs uh from March backwards almost into February uh so yeah those
[01:42:04] are all my thoughts of why he's pulling something out of an ice chest uh to impress her well it's a refrigerator chair he's an inventor and the myth of hephestos
[01:42:18] after his rejection from Hera he creates her a Golden Throne but she gets stuck to it by his clever design so here we see a refrigerated chair is what he invented it's a freezing
[01:42:32] chair ah it's The Golden Throne of Hera Ah that's amazing chance that's amazing so I love it I'm saying I love it Rin slair I'm pegging Rin slay as the
[01:42:45] Queen of Heaven so either Hera or rehea either one applies just as Victor is both Kronos and Adonis and Adam and hephestos and Hermes all of them having traits of them all because they're allegory for aspects of one being the
[01:42:59] son or God in the different angles of the year you can even make a case that Ren slayer's hat has a peacock feather or something very much like it couldn't find couldn't find any uh images of the
[01:43:12] Hat close up and well lit to know but we could just pretend it's a peacock head feather which is a symbol of Hera but there's definitely a big roll reversal going on in this episode where instead of Hera rejecting hephestos hephestos is
[01:43:26] rejecting Hera so this this is it man it's Hera in the chera it's a freezing chair she's Frozen to the chair it's got to be I don't know why else they would do it because he's a
[01:43:39] fesus he's Vulcan nice I knew You' see it when it occurred to me I was like no way uh totally totally and you know in this scene it's
[01:43:54] kind of interesting because um um he's while he's uh trying to woo uh red Slayer we find out later that
[01:44:06] there's some kind of weird thing going on with him and Miss minutes uh so it's like uh there's some jealousy some unspoken jealousy in the subtext here um
[01:44:18] and this is very interesting because of uh the the number eight has the lust and before I did the maneuver we had the lust card the uh the Leo card and the
[01:44:32] Star Card were both related to the number eight position here uh in this Leo aspect of the number eight so I see the lion is very much um Miss minutes she's like a combination of the strength
[01:44:47] combined with Hera because of the white she's got white gloves so she has Equity uh but the star card was in the number eight position so Mis minutes and ren Slayer are both relating to this
[01:45:01] controller uh Lusty domineering aspect um yeah which has a a strong draw to the number two to The Giver so there's a a controller and a giver uh and it's funny
[01:45:15] because like he is giving her the attention but miss minut is the one who's like oh hey hey give me some of that attention don't forget about me she's keeping track of uh who is favored by his uh his uh
[01:45:29] admiration yeah there's a bit of a weird love triangle going on here and yeah Miss minut is the Lusty one so I see why you're saying that now we should talk about Miss minutes the Holy
[01:45:44] Ghost because this is a point where she starts trying to butt in on their flirtation and Victor says is this Apparition your helper and as soon as we get Apparition and helper I'm like okay
[01:45:57] for sure Holy Ghost because the the G um in the johanan gospels or I guess not gospels but books of the Bible the ones attributed to John the Baptist he refers
[01:46:11] to the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost as paracos or in English a the paraclete which is the Divine ad ific at or helper or companion and obviously that's what this
[01:46:26] Apparition is it's a Helper and a companion of sorts the the word paracletos in gatria is uh 8810 in the ancient
[01:46:40] Greek gatria which really shows the system that I'm talking about one of the things about the system is when you get into numbers where there's a zero you drop the zero or you can't drop the zero and you're considered the same as you
[01:46:54] know zeros are like a blank space you know Skip the zero so basically the fact that paracos is 810 means we can think about 81 which is the number for the magic square of the
[01:47:06] Moon and a lot of words that the of 81 is a value are are lunar in nature so here we see uh the three of them are like sun moon uh sun and moon plus the entire sky or the entire Earth or or the
[01:47:21] earth and the sky the Physical Realm being like the three beings of the Trinity parac paracos is perah which means beside or next to and cletos meaning illustrious or one that is
[01:47:35] called forth special boy basically cletos is the same as uh the same meaning as the elect or the elected or the eclecto eclectics the priesthood called themselves this
[01:47:50] especially in the Alexandria days when they you know when whatever takeover and historical revision was going on so the paracos is the illustrious one called forth to be beside you which is the
[01:48:03] invoking of the Holy Spirit now other fascinating connections to this 81 U very interesting is the word that is uh spelled teth
[01:48:14] bethen which in English transliterates as TBA or TVA the TVA as in thba or thieves or
[01:48:27] theva now think about the God of Thieves and think about thieves with the B and the V swap that happens maybe that whole attribution of the the Savior Hermes Mercury being the god of Thieves could
[01:48:43] be applied to this Swap and we're actually just misunderstanding and it was theas because this word teth beten feba is identical philologically to the word for Arc which
[01:48:57] is spelled Tav bet hey but you know it's just a different version of T the letters all being interchangeable that's the word for the ark so here's a perfect example of the moon and the Ark being mystically connected but the difference
[01:49:11] is instead of meaning Arc teth bet in or theba means to sink or to impress as in an impression made on a coin so coins are not just minted they're
[01:49:25] moed the meaning of this word implies that nature is like the impression made on wax by a signant ring impressed with characters written by the hand of God so God basically smashes down the
[01:49:40] the material the clay of the world with his ring that has the impression of his word and that's how we get the shape of the earth the earth and the Ark are ARA Earth they're the same also in the system like a macrocosm
[01:49:54] microcosm fractal of each other so I'm sure you can see the similarity between Miss minutes the moon and a coin of course that's totally there other words in Hebrew with this 81 value are
[01:50:07] fullness or a which is a quality the moon can take on anger and passion which Miss minutes displays later in the episode very clearly the Throne of the third eye similar to her ability to see
[01:50:20] and project images across time and space and also similar to the meaning of Aries the the rash the the Gate of wisdom another word that means uh in in Hebrew that means 81 is a word for devotion and
[01:50:33] fervor also a descriptor of Mis minutes interestingly and visions and Revelations which she provides in Latin the word anima meaning Spirit same as
[01:50:45] the rash of the ruach equals 81 as in the animamundi the soul of the world or the spirit of order because that's what Mundi really means it's like order and beautification artistic beautification
[01:50:59] so I threw up the magic squares of the Sun and the Moon here because they're fun especially the one of the Moon because it gives you that 369 repeat And Timely is very Tesla
[01:51:13] esque Carrie Woodley says hint yeah nature is the hint of God excellent excellent um
[01:51:27] animamundi is a very uh profound thing to know of and so often it's a I mean it's like every episode we do you and I are brushing up against the
[01:51:42] animamundi and differentiating it from anim mechanicus the uh the animated machine uh in the me mechanics and it's profound
[01:51:54] because the science of the machine it rhymes with the science of the the spirit of the realm of the world the natural uh uh high
[01:52:07] listic emanations of being uh but the anima mechanicus is just a simac it's just a WN toe overlay uh and here it is right here it's like
[01:52:19] he's torn between a real woman or a machine that uh and sure enough we'll find out in a second what he chooses betweena Mundy and Ana mechanicus good yeah that's a really
[01:52:34] good point there's no taky backies either once you scorn Hera you're done she's she don't forget but I just want to uh
[01:52:45] further highlight here why the why I talk about this why it's important is because gatria can prove the the Fingerprints of the system that existed between cultures and across time that
[01:52:59] the word in Greek in the New Testament paracos the 81 of that is the same as Latin anema which is the spirit or the Breath of God or the soul so 81 in one
[01:53:14] language 81 in another language different words same concept proving the system this seems to be where we even get a lot of our words our language is obviously just dripping with the the uh the system if you will it's in
[01:53:28] everything so either humans did that or God did that I don't know which and the funny thing is language goes so far back nobody ever did know like the people back like the priests back 2,000 years ago were wondering like did God just put
[01:53:43] these words in our head the way that he did for us to discover that there's this num numerical uh value to it and should we make sure that what we come up with matches that value you know like I don't think anybody knows it's a chicken or an egg thing which is part of

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:53:57] why the the Lo idea of the logos is present like we can we can't ever know that's the beauty of it we can always we're always on that coin toss of like did humans create this incredible system
[01:54:10] or is it a product of the spirit coming through US kind of like to think the latter but I also like to think humans did it because I I like like to imagine that humans have that potential for
[01:54:23] creative genius and you know multi-leveled thinking so let's just say both for now and then um of course we have another repeat of uh the last time
[01:54:38] remember timely grabbed at his chest or his solar plexus he was being called a luminary in a dialogue this time he's singular like soul Soul Invictus the the son and the moon are equally singular so
[01:54:51] miss mens and Victor tell each other they you are pretty singular yourself so uh next we next we see Ren Slayer as the child
[01:55:05] or the product of God the Creator uh who was represented by timely and the Holy Spirit you know if they're like the Sun and the Moon she's Miss moonit but renair is also Victor's mother because she was the one who birthed him by
[01:55:18] leaving the TV vaa Bible in his window when he was a boy and she's also so clearly flirtatious with him in the scene so we're really getting that Mythos of the self-generating Trinity the mother whose son is her husband and
[01:55:32] also the husband is the mother's Creator Victor creates Mis minutes Mis minutes shapes or informs or trains Ren Slayer Ren Slayer initiates Victor Victor creates Mis minutes it's a circular
[01:55:46] process of creation just like the sun and it's seasonal journey through the year and this is the perfect time for us to break down Ren slayer's first name because he's like and you misses you
[01:56:00] know he says misses because he wants to know if she's uh she's free or not and she gives her she gives her first name to him which is ravona we haven't fully really thought about what that name ravona means but this is the perfect
[01:56:14] episode to make it make sense so first is r a in Hebrew you could spell that rash VAV which is RA or RAV a guide or a
[01:56:26] friend or you could spell it as rash Alf uh VAV either way you can spell it either way the second spelling would be to perceive to investigate or to
[01:56:39] understand and Anna or I'm sorry ano you know ravona o n n a back put that backwards is ano the year so there it is ravona is the guide to the
[01:56:52] year or the friend of the year or the one who understands the female generative power uh because ano forgot to say ano is also
[01:57:05] like phonetically like the Yuna or the you know o n and a a n and O whichever way you put it Yuna is the dove or the the Yoni the dove of semiramis or Aphrodite or Mary so so yeah ravona Guide to the
[01:57:20] Year friend of the year one who understands the year or investigates the year or the guide or friend or investigator or understander of the female generative powers or both and in a wild synchronicity here I just threw
[01:57:35] in ravona in the most basic way you'd spell it in Hebrew gamry just to see what would fall out and is rash Al VAV aen nun nun ala and what do you know
[01:57:46] it's 314 which is piie P again and what is it what is it that you need to understand the year what do you need to understand or measure a circle or Cycles circumference you need Pi that's the guide to the year or to the circle or
[01:58:02] the cycle so bam there's like a lot in her name I think this was definitely the perfect time to to really dig into it yeah
[01:58:15] buddy uh so we actually did uh uh in earlier episodes uh when we were getting acquainted with ravona uh we correlated her to the uh to
[01:58:29] the universe card because ronus is an anagram for Universe uh can you pop up the most recent one uh but this is her ear early this is
[01:58:43] in her Authority when she's working for the TVA in her uniform wearing a whole another Motif she has fulfilled the universe card and also very correspondent to the herant when she's
[01:58:57] playing the judge the role of that judge um but I just thought I would share that generally I would associate her with the universe we have in the past but she's in a whole new role for this episode she actually has kind of walked away from
[01:59:12] that and now she's on a she's kind of gone Rogue so yeah putting her on a in a different light as the that star card with this new costume uh is very appropo yeah man Universe
[01:59:26] yoniverse better listen to them ladies a lot of wisdom coming out of them ladies just maybe don't put them in charge no fense ladies okay
[01:59:45] and next in the slides got to get out my Arrangement there we go oh my gosh what's happening stop okay everything just went nuts give me a second let me fix my
[02:00:09] PowerPoint got qu in a time a Time jolt yeah I just it just skipped me all the way to the end somehow and it's not sharing the right thing so spoiler
[02:00:22] spoiler this whole show is spoilers it's all we do okay did this come up all right cool now I just got to skip back to where we
[02:00:34] were oh man we've come a long way already thing I was most excited for I think was to drop the the freezing chair of hero on you
[02:00:48] though was fun all right yeah man okay so um this is the point where next Rona and Miss mines they throw Loki under the bus to persuade Victor not to trust the wizard and his
[02:01:02] Butler uh because he switches sides he plays both sides because he's Mercury of course then we see timely in this episode he throws out a lot of French phrases in particular when they ask him
[02:01:15] about if this is his home he says no this is just a p which means foot on Earth that's a phrase that was used I think by Crusaders originally or Knights of some
[02:01:28] kind to refer to like a um just Little Shack that they would post up in when they were on a journey one place to another it's just where they would stop put their foot on the earth as and get out of the saddle and go to sleep and
[02:01:40] then get back on the horse the next day so he just uses this to go and sleep in between making sales in Chicago but his lab is in Wisconsin that's where it gets lower taxes you see here they're
[02:01:54] escaping from the room through the window through the hay they're going through the you know we see that repeatedly in this episode just so we're sure to be thinking about the Star Card of the hay and usually there's some
[02:02:07] illumination very present but not always sometimes that's a lack of Illumination then they come out of uh the window and I see this little little booth that's a honey honeycomb I couldn't help but think about what we
[02:02:22] talked of previously that during the World Fair of Chicago there was a famous serial killer at that time and his name was HH Holmes so if you just like drop the Oni of the honey and look at it like
[02:02:35] HH it's and then you know you make the the comb C more like a then you have HH I think that's the reference I don't know maybe it's just honey honey comb
[02:02:48] for no reason other than as a prop but that's what I think about there's a killer on the loose you know cuz they're running through the streets every there's a threat and danger I feel like that makes sense the angry Rober Baron is here our heroes are looking around
[02:03:03] for the for timely and they're having no luck they get called rat bags very inconsiderate so chance I got a I got had a loose a loose dangling Chad from
[02:03:22] the last episode and this was an a a late Epiphany uh can you bring up the most recent graphic in the telegram that I sent to you uh this has to do with uh remember the scene where Victor timley
[02:03:35] receives the T TVA manual through the window and we mentioned the veil of the window uh the curtain of the window being a
[02:03:45] veil well it turns out I think that there is a nod to this book that is the original generative seed of Science
[02:03:58] Fiction and uh I highly recommend people look into this fascinating phenomena from history air quotes in the history of this seed of Science Fiction is
[02:04:11] tightly interwoven to the uh the World's Fair you can see by the timeline here um so yeah yeah it's called a dweller on two planets or it's also named the
[02:04:23] dividing of the way it's a book written by Frederick Spencer Oliver uh who was born in 1866 interesting fact uh
[02:04:38] gerf is uh reported to be born in six n in 1866 but that's a lie he's actually uh he dates the 1877 which is the same year lady Freda Harris
[02:04:51] was born and that's fascinating because my whole project is gf's design with Lady Freda Harris's art so that's just a fascinating thread um but this child is
[02:05:06] said to have channeled an amazing fictional story of a Sci-Fi future that is puts Philip K dick and all the Sci-Fi writers to shame on the first
[02:05:19] go and so I think there's a strong thread that they are uh hinting or nodding at the power of this seed of uh of Science Fiction it is so profound and
[02:05:35] it is said to also have a strong root in uh Atlantis uh in Atlantis mythology so I just oh but one of the reasons many reasons why I think that there's a powerful relationship between the two
[02:05:49] is because in his futuristic uh sci-fi reality they say that people were flying around on veils the veil is the flying mechanism
[02:06:03] in that future and I just find that profound because uh valis um is one of PK Dick's like psychic pink connecting thread that is today is T-Mobile the T-Mobile pink
[02:06:17] magenta placent a theme is a collectivism spell of Philip K dicks valis uh which is a basically the allseeing collective
[02:06:32] uh panopticon of interlinking nosis that is themed with the pink so yeah I just wanted to kind of thread The Original Seed of Science Fiction to the uh the Victor timely
[02:06:46] window um because we're looking for Windows in time when history changed and this little story changed science fiction forever so I think it's a very powerful corespondent I want to First reference
[02:07:00] PK's comment here because he says he does his sales in Chicago and uh and then lives in Wisconsin for tax reasons or some [ __ ] but PK is right I don't think they were paying income tax in
[02:07:13] 1893 that might be some kind of programming or not programming of us but just they're programmed in the the authors and they didn't even think twice about it who knows the legal history of income tax is a checkered thing and I believe the first time it ever got
[02:07:28] instituted was temporarily during the Civil War and then off and on again until finally they got people to buy it permanently but concerning what you just said and with this uh what's it called
[02:07:42] the name of this book a dweller on two planets or the dividing of the way okay so check this out out in your image here it says in its introduction Oliver claims that the book had been channeled through him via automatic writing BL
[02:07:56] Blah Blah by a spirit calling himself felos the thetan what did I just talk about okay so we were talking about s
[02:08:09] sanan santhan the only source of Phoenician mythology written by felo of biblos okay biblos is the Bible the book the Phoenicians were the people of the book
[02:08:23] their Capital was allegedly biblos bilos of biblos so there's so there's that The Eclectic sect uh is one of the the big important names of the
[02:08:34] eclectics or the therapeut of uh Egypt where it was felo the Jew referenced by usus a lot but that's aside this he's
[02:08:45] fos The thetan that's TB e that's thieves that's TVA like literally it's might as well
[02:08:56] say it was written by uh is written by P pile which is a a word for a gate or wisdom the tvan the Tibetan the thean thieves you
[02:09:11] know even uh in Egypt the city of thieves was The Phoenician capital for a time when they held the Egyptian Empire so like the fact the fact that he's saying that the spirit that he channeled is felos that the Baton automatically
[02:09:25] makes the whole thing super sus like he's part of the the you know the oligarchy of the priesthood that's been writing history for everybody for all this time super
[02:09:37] sus dude felis the theb betan come on you can't get that [ __ ] past me yeah man it's yeah it's even like uh it's almost the the Pharaoh of Tavistock
[02:09:52] is almost what I see there the Pharaohs of Tavistock but the story and pharoh same word yes yes but the things that that come
[02:10:05] through are actually what's what's amazing is that it's way above the pay grade of anybody that doesn't have technology at their fingertips uh the story is really
[02:10:18] far out and it's it's an old old story um you know Mark from my family thinks I'm crazy he's very familiar with this thread uh so yeah be interesting how this resonates for
[02:10:31] him well the Sci-Fi is riddled with this like Dune what I keep referencing this guy was writing before the internet or before personal computers and he was writing about a a
[02:10:45] far-flung future where Humanity had already seen the rise of Mach thinking machines and artificial intelligence and they had a whole Universal Jihad against it to make it taboo permanently and uh the god emperor of Dooney says stu stuff
[02:10:59] like when you have the the creative or imaginative uh machines in your Society it makes people it makes people ignore each other and I'm like how do you know that how do
[02:11:14] you even know that like there was no such thing in your time like the whole the the weird thing about Dune as a Sci-Fi is the whole book is centered around prophecy and and large cycles of time but it reads like Prophecy of the
[02:11:27] next cycle of time that was to come after Frank Herbert's time so yeah there's there's something there sci-fi is there's something there with
[02:11:40] sci-fi yeah man uh one thing I uh I don't that I hold on to like a precious gem about Doom is that the Original
[02:11:52] Stories uh the character's internal monologue was actually broadcast through the writing and even in the film you were actually privy to their internal thoughts and uh and it was in the
[02:12:07] actor's voice echoing like in a in an empty room the way they portrayed it so you could literally hear their thoughts kind of like reverberating a little bit uh that's how you could distinguish it
[02:12:19] from their actual speaking voice and the new Dune that's not even a part of the plot at all it's not even it's like they they didn't find that interesting as an
[02:12:32] artifact to carry forward but by removing it it actually makes it more important because I have learned that there are people in this world who don't even have an internal monologue oh nice
[02:12:47] big up big up uh yeah to find out that some people don't even talk to themselves within their own head space uh they don't even have and they don't fill spare time with
[02:13:00] random conversation with themselves and that they have maybe even extremely prolonged periods where there is nothing going on inside that realization kind of it boggles me I'm not concerned but it's
[02:13:14] just unique because I don't have any dead airtime in my head in my gigantic chamber I am constantly having many conversations all the time I can't imagine how B boring it would be not to
[02:13:27] be that way but uh long story short I believe that not having internal monologue is actually beneficial for the powers that presume to want to be and I think they want to breed out your
[02:13:41] internal monologue I think this hails to the the motto of uh NATO is a mind unfettered with deliberation this is the Delta these are
[02:13:54] the Deltas of uh of Orwell these some people would say that's what they want the Chinese to be like that the Chinese have such a hive mind that they are a quintessential Delta and they don't even have any internal deliberation of do I
[02:14:08] want Pepsi or do I want Coke they just go along to get along so these are profound artifacts I just wanted to put on your radar because I know you're digging into Dune that the internal monologue is a a treasure of that story
[02:14:21] but then the other treasure is the the language of compulsion that the the Royals actually have a language that can make people do what they're told uh that makes them uh uh circumvent their Free
[02:14:35] Will and I think that this Frank Herbert is preserving another treasure that could be a language that has true purchase to causality built into the very
[02:14:48] fundamentals of every sentence is true purchase on causality and I think the English language is watered down I think it's watered down we don't have the causality we thought we had and you need
[02:15:01] years and years and years of training in captured uh terms of art captured terms of art that if you don't have the paperwork to wield those terms you don't get purchase on causality this is what
[02:15:14] they did with the legal system and we know it well let me offer first of all thank you cucumber for this generous Super Chat he says I wonder how to explain to an Amish fellow what a computer is and can do that' be fun but
[02:15:28] I want to offer this possibility because I'm obviously doing just a fiction and an allegory but in that framework it's not the words themselves that have purchase on compulsion or on causality
[02:15:42] it's the tone and the posture and the Resonance of the word so it's my opinion that it's not so much about the word itself but it's about how your it's about the energy and the
[02:15:57] coherence behind it you know and that when you're talking about the internal monologue and the Mind feted by deliberation and never having any dead air in your mind there's a possibility that the person who exists without the
[02:16:12] internal monologue is actually the one who is whole that they're just there in the moment and there's not the schizophrenia of a cacophony of voices clamoring for their attention as different thoughts at any given time I'm not a saying one way or the other I'm
[02:16:27] just putting it out there as like what if the opposite is true you know like what if the internal monologue is a symtom of our fragmented psyche who knows because who's talking to who in there who's talking and who's listening
[02:16:41] it's an infinite recursion the I'm the one that notices that something is noticing that there is something to notice that but who is the one that's noticing that there's a noticer and it just goes on whereas without any of that you're just like you're just here
[02:16:56] there's no there's no subject object separation so which is which is more coherent that's the question but on the other hand language is a language is the very pickaxe that chips away into the
[02:17:10] psyche to make the fragmentation so it's a weird like it's a super weird Loop of causality that I don't know we ever will get to the end of it in this life it is it is so profound it is so
[02:17:24] profound um I think of the sofa Ring The Ring of sofas the sovereigns and these uh you know the
[02:17:36] Symposium is to some degree uh a metaphor for doing an internal monologue you know talking to yourself about you know am I G to eat before I drink do I got to go do this before I you know
[02:17:50] getting your priorities in order and uh some people have their kungu quite dialed so it doesn't look like a process what and they seem to be of single-mindedness uh that comes with
[02:18:07] practice but I think uh to not have a a counsel with yourself is a yeah I see what you're saying that it does come off as being uh whole I do see where you're coming from but
[02:18:20] it's only a matter of one interloper one interloper in your entire Free Will is youer so it's almost like the internal uh councel gives us uh I don't know some
[02:18:34] degree of uh like oh let me think let me sleep on it you can make me the offer today but I'm GNA sleep on it and I'll come back to you with my with my rebuttal you know what I mean yeah it gives you the uh you can look forward
[02:18:46] and backward you right it makes you multi-dimensional that's it that's it I could go on I could start talking about doing more and the god Emperor with his ability to remember all of his past lives photographically and see the
[02:19:00] future he's totally Janice man like those later the movie is wild enough but those later Dune books they are off the they're off the hook man uh but we got to get back into our analysis buddy I like this detour but we got to get back
[02:19:14] into to analysis I mean we don't have to but I'd like to he I got I want to say if he has full access to his past lives that's placental transmission that's the placental transmission to have all your
[02:19:27] past lives all the elders there at your beck and call that's the placental transmission the mo be them exactly so okay so uh okay we were watching the Robber Baron and the the
[02:19:44] heroes looking for Victor and the ladies they can't find them because they're hiding in a little a little hay look at that it's another little hay they pop out of a little window uh now then it cuts to a scene where

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
02:20:39] at this 205 stuff of the throng and the multitude with the atsma because of the addition of the uh rash plus hay the Sun and star cards the Sun and Aries all of that um and the strength and
[02:20:50] numbers But continuing to the 205 of it all it is a really relevant number because these characters are boarding a ship a a decked ship like the word
[02:21:03] sapina which means exactly that and equals 205 it's a decked ship this is actually the name in the Hebrew convention for the Argo constellation it's saphina the the both that they're
[02:21:17] boarding to Cross Lake Michigan is a decked ship it's a it's sapina but it's also called the SS Heron it's like oh you have to like you can't even see this stuff you have to like brighten your
[02:21:31] screenshots to even read these little things but the Heron is a symbol of tho Hermes or p in Egypt it's either a symbol of of Thoth in his role as the
[02:21:42] Creator Cosmo Creator or in Greek the Heron is a messenger symbol for Hermes but either way this boat or this Argo is is the ark as well because it's their salvation from destruction since the
[02:21:56] angry robber barons don't follow them here to kill them and they ride through this boat through the night and it's the dawn when they get through so it's like a microcosm of the cycle they're
[02:22:07] surviving the winter the night Etc and In This Moment here in the dark you really get the symbolism of Miss munits Miss mins and the Moon super clear she's like their only light source
[02:22:20] in the dark when the moon hits your ey you know all of that that's a more here we see uh this is where we see the TVA handbook again and and Victor
[02:22:36] starts talking about how um he keeps everything he's ever imagined and since we're on the Heron it's appropriate to bring up Victor's uh the writing Victor's done in his handbook I like
[02:22:48] that now we're going to talk about that Arc the word in Hebrew for Noah is Arc Tav bet he but remember the alternate spelling teth beten it's theba or
[02:23:01] TV an impression is one made on a coin the other meaning of this word is nature the second spelling teth bet in nature is the CU nature is like the impression
[02:23:14] made on Wax By A Signet ring impressed with characters written by the hand of God so he's talking about in this scene he says the book was delivered to me when I was a child dropped into my life by some Divine
[02:23:28] hand what that's the hand that wears the signant ring in the cyclical creating his own Nature by impressing upon himself via the Divine hand that he had himself had leave the book The Book of
[02:23:43] characters in his window it's super mystical stuff and what's even even more far out is the meaning of impression which is coming down and stamping being like from above because that's laid up in the word it also can be used uh to
[02:23:57] pertain to sinking literally the sinking of a ship further connecting it to the ark the ark is a ship it's a vessel to contain the words of God like the TVA Bible that are stamped or impressed upon like you know cu the ark is also the
[02:24:12] vessel that contains the the tablets of Moses Commandments that were impressed upon right and Moses was a baby in a basket a which the word for it is the same as the word they used for Noah's Ark it's Tav
[02:24:26] bet hey it's a thba he's you know he's uh he's Victor the thetan and in a moment speaking of sinking Rin Slayer is going to get sunk
[02:24:38] by his nature his uh his loner nature all of that is in play all right take it away making you big still muted home homie there we go thank you so yeah at
[02:25:04] the moment they're on the boat and he's discussing this Divine hand that dropped the the TV Handbook of Enlightenment the
[02:25:16] illumination onto him um and so this Divine hand is very significant because Y is the glyph on the uh the hermit card
[02:25:27] um but once he cuts her loose once he uh disavows the potential of having her as a partner she gets dropped and when she drops she has a fall from grace and she
[02:25:40] becomes uh vindictive oh for one she slows down she's GNA slow him down this is an aspect of sloth when she gets dropped out in that boat gets dropped down she is running
[02:25:53] slow she's lagging behind while he goes on on the big boat she has to start get her getting to work to keep up with him and she eventually uh catches up later
[02:26:04] so she falls out of the number nine she falls and she goes back to I think she becomes the universe card again when she comes when she pops back on the story here in a littleit especially because she has like a wand or baton when she
[02:26:20] comes back yeah yeah she when she comes back with the Vengeance she's back in her old uh business her business mode it's business
[02:26:32] time so okay and then this scene continues and uh ravona basically claims credit for being the Divine hand who drops the book but then caddy Miss minutes is like you brought it to him
[02:26:46] the way the post man brings a post but that's funny because the reference to the post man is perfect for the fact that they're on the SS Heron the Hermes U being symbolized by the Heron
[02:26:57] Divine messenger the the mailman and uh then we see Victor talks about the TVA handbook being what he thinks is like a a dialogue between myself and the Visionary author Oro boros and the Ora boros of it all is very encapsulated by
[02:27:13] this episode because we learn that the future Kronos which has the root meaning of seed sent back the seeds of his own creation into the past and that those seeds sprouted and were handed off to Ora boros who wrote the book that
[02:27:27] inspired the seeds to sprout it's like who actually invented all the TVA technology was it oroboros or was it Victor timley or a version of him there's no beginning or no end that's
[02:27:39] what makes it a cycle or a circle and there's lots of symbolism in this and I'll just leave out the gatria part cuz I feel like I'm going overboard with that but he does hand Rin Slayer a you know she's flirty with him she says I'm
[02:27:54] starting to see the manual become T and he hands her a like a paper mâché or no more like origami uh flower it's like a lily so this is the Lily or the Lotus
[02:28:08] that the Supreme deity is born out of it's actually another symbol of the Ark because it rests on the water and it requires the filth or the mud or the Darkness for the flower to Blossom so you see the lots of versions of the
[02:28:21] deity on the lily pad or on the lotus flower and that's the reason also the Lotus is a symbol of the third eye the rash the gate to wisdom so big bigly bigly important especially that it's
[02:28:37] made of paper it's a paper paper Lily okay now another fun bit of gatria that is I think worth talking about
[02:28:50] is well this is the big rle reversal moment instead of Hera rejecting hephestos he rejects her so in the Greek mythology Hera who is hephestos his mother thinks that he's just too ugly so she throws him off
[02:29:05] Olympus throws him off the mountain remember that the mountain and the Ark are dual symbols for the same thing and here he throws her off of the boat Mountain which it makes sense there's a
[02:29:21] it makes sense that she needs to go into the water because she's the she's been the Queen of Heaven archetype in this episode you know the the love interest to Kronos so she's like ma rehea uh Mary
[02:29:33] Aphrodite Venus all the rest of the the watery oceany goddesses so she's got to go into the water the mar metaphorically she walks the plank uh you know that's what they call when you get thrown overboard walking
[02:29:48] the plank funny enough plank in Hebrew the word for plank is 600 I don't know why that is if you spell out the word for water uh MIM as it is mystically
[02:29:59] spelled in plentitude which would be MIM Yad yadet me Yad me then it becomes uh 200 like rash so here's another mystical link between water and the sun because
[02:30:13] of course the sun cannot create without water but cannot be water without the Sun so they need there's this weird dual thing going on because water would be ice if it wasn't uh heated by the Sun and then there's another thing that
[02:30:26] happens in Hebrew where if you put the me at the end of a word it becomes called MIM sopit and has a different glyph or they call it m final and that actually goes from a a value of 40 to
[02:30:40] 600 so there there again two ways to look at it the m connecting to the sun in who knows maybe the sun is the recorder of memory of of the whole Cosmos because it requires witness to
[02:30:56] form a memory and the Sun is the big eye in the sky you know or maybe the moon and the sun together are the recorders or the stars are involved just spit blond here but I think it's funny that she gets she gets thrown
[02:31:10] overboard she has to walk the plank and we can get all these 600s out of it like look at her face as she's having to row the boat I mean is that not Hera
[02:31:21] stuck to the chera like super pissed and so I want to talk about uh some more 600 stuff though because I mean it is really relevant this is a microcosm of the cycle because she goes into the
[02:31:37] water they get on the boat at night and then at the climax it's Dawn so that's a new cycle that's just it's what it is microcosm macrocosm
[02:31:48] so uh in Hebrew there's a phrase um the word for Dawn is Theos Shahar I think that's how you'd say it and if you put a hey in front of it like the then it
[02:32:00] becomes hey Theos Shahar and that equals 600 and it's the dawn but in Greek the it's he theot uh in Greek Hees is 600 in either
[02:32:15] case the phrase the dawn is like d a WN although that's cognate to Dawn as in the Lord d n or Don like in aonis or a lot of rivers have the phrase Don in it
[02:32:29] so it's a it's a solar God water type of word as well but whether it's the Greek heot or the Hebrew heo Shahar it is 600 so it's a perfect example of how the
[02:32:44] system works where spelling changes as the powers of notation change between alphabets because the alphabets have been improved upon it's exactly like the name of the Lord or the son Frey F Roa
[02:32:56] 608 being the same as Finn which is f nun nun 608 or drop the Ada the vowel in either and it's 600 the old number of the cycle because later it was 608 and then other times and with other Cults it
[02:33:10] was 650 but you can kind of pinpoint what era of the cult and place you're looking at by what number they give to this cycle but e either way uh she's rowing for the morning hey
[02:33:25] theot so let's also think about the name of the mother of Achilles Achilles being a very early archetype of this savior
[02:33:34] thetus thetus hey thetis thetis thetis basically thetus the mother of Achilles is the same as the word for Dawn and she's the mother of the Savior she's
[02:33:49] said to be a water nymph in later Greek mythology but there's actually a written record a fragment that exists uh attesting to her uh worship and that an
[02:34:02] early there's an early Alman I don't know where that is him that exists that identifies thetis as the creator of the universe so like we just get the ilad version she's Achilles mother she dips
[02:34:16] him in the the water to make him invulnerable but his heel sticks out but by the way Achilles getting shot in the heel that's how chrishna dies gets a wound in the heel by the way just putting that out there not very well
[02:34:30] known a little factoid but uh she's a merry figure easily enough and I wanted to just point that out how like she's rowing for the dawn the dawn is what gives birth to the new son you know like
[02:34:44] it's all part of the system and all in all this androgynous way pretty fun and I really like these examples that show you how spellings change but the meaning stays the same numerically and
[02:35:00] definitionally yeah uh I help me out here I believe there's a Greek word for the ocean that is thete is that correct does that sound
[02:35:14] familiar to you thete I know okos uh felet te okay um there's teete who is a
[02:35:31] daughter of dionis and a river god uh okay yeah it's just a uh I I remember this as
[02:35:46] uh in xenophon uh in his uh anabasis the story of his Retreat uh he the soldiers at the front of the line start crying out and he thinks it's a battle and he he thinks
[02:36:00] this is the big Showdown and it turns out what they're crying out is ocean the ocean and it becomes like a memory a joyful memory for the Greeks to be like we made it to the ocean it's the
[02:36:13] end of our adventure so I thought Al rocking my brain on Greek I took some Greek lessons and thete is the second person way of saying like you want
[02:36:31] likeo you want some wine like th means it's like a word a verb referring to want or desire but I don't know about ocean I need to get back into taking Greek lessons to actually be able to speak it it's it's pretty fun
[02:36:46] I like the rhythm of it yeah man so I want to talk about the Achilles heel being a vulnerability and that having an earlier incarnation in um um and Hindu
[02:37:03] mythology actually no the Achilles version in my in my book is older because Achilles is uh goes back to the atrans and there's artifacts that are older than Krishna Krishna artifacts it's one of those examples of like where
[02:37:18] did it come from earlier in terms of what we can physically find so I think it's a yeah um uh west to east not east to west in terms of that nice
[02:37:32] nice I think that we could surmise that this the the vulnerability of the heel is um
[02:37:46] kind of I think there's a dark word play or a dark punning going on because um we know that our language of the subconscious is implying things that
[02:37:59] are from underneath it's right under your nose and if it's right under your nose you're taking it for granted it's the best place to hide things so your base desires your animus your animal Instinct it's like so close that you
[02:38:13] overlook it and it turns out when you come to overstand and you look down upon yourself uh all along uh the language is
[02:38:26] anatomical in profound and fun ways but what I'm getting at is I think part of this CC urant and alarmist um
[02:38:38] catastrophe language is baked into um many cultures I don't think it's Unique to the English language and I think this uh using Seashore metaphors to
[02:38:53] insinuate fearful images or fearful Concepts is uh I think it's been baked into other languages and I think that is the Achilles heel it's almost like a
[02:39:05] kill switch or a or a um a back Channel cancel program oper Execute Order 66 and I think this is where what we consider
[02:39:20] healing is actually the heal Lang this is the language that is speaking to your weakness and so the healing language is intrinsically vulnerable this is why the
[02:39:34] word rape is still in the word therapy the word rape has to stay in the word therapy because when you engage in therapeutic practice is you are being
[02:39:47] vulnerable you have to agree from the jump that yes I'm going in here vulnerable like a child and I'm subjecting myself to somebody else's opinion because I believe that they're going to heal me with their opinion and
[02:40:01] so this weakness of of the Achilles heel and the heel language of what I've been unpacking from the sea urant Seashore emergency Carrie Mullis spell I think
[02:40:14] it's been imbued into other languages in other cultures and I think it's even a treaty that it's uh it's required that um other languages have had the same
[02:40:27] weak spot of uh implying sea Ury uh spiny things that are going to uh take your take the standing out from under you so that you
[02:40:41] don't have good standing and this is exactly what they do in the in the in the courts so yeah I think that is the Achilles heel is that all of our languages have a kill switch to pull your confidence out from under you and
[02:40:56] it's baked into the words we choose around crisis and there's there's lots of examples of that like you know where to do one thing you're symbolically doing
[02:41:09] the opposite you know like think about symbolically what it means to turn your back on somebody right but turning your back on them is also a symbol of of opening up your vulnerability to them so
[02:41:24] you think one thing like oh I'm showing them I'm gaining the power on them I'm leaving them behind but you're also exposing your back to them you're giving them the power there's like tons of these little paradoxes I find that
[02:41:38] interesting I mean even in this gatria of uh like I I threw on the screen here as well that the 510 of the rash and the sun one more thing oh sure I just wanted to uh maybe bring
[02:41:55] everybody's thoughts to um can you recall the last time you really felt that sinking
[02:42:08] feeling that sinking feeling is the sense of betrayal the sense that you walked into the Trap the sense that there's no turning back that it's all
[02:42:22] it's all decided from here on and that sinking feeling is also having the Earth pulled out from under you when you're standing on the ocean shore and if you stand there long enough you don't you're no longer what you
[02:42:37] thought was ground is no longer ground and you're already burying yourself by not doing anything if you sit there with that sinking feeling long enough you just end up under the Earth and so the sinking feeling is like I'm not doing anything and I'm already dying and you
[02:42:52] can feel it anatomically and so our language around that sinking feeling is literally bringing you into the ocean so you can feel the Earth be pulled out from under your feet and I have had this happen to me in ways I will never forget
[02:43:07] and because I had that experience I can bring people's language back to the fact that we are invoking these emotional States and so when she gets betrayed and gets La launched down
[02:43:20] on the ship and sold Upstream she has that sinking feeling but as soon as you get that feeling you just uh roll up your sleeves start working twice as hard yeah she gets her power back it's like
[02:43:34] the idea that the sinking of the Signet ring you know in that that word te bet I in TAA Teba that the nature is created
[02:43:47] by the impression of the sinking down and pressing down from above from God and think about creation in the microcosm of your life like what happens when you reach your low point
[02:44:01] the only way up the only way from there is to create a new self or create a new identity to Rise From the Ashes like the Phoenix so we're talking about the cycle of course or when when a mother is about to do the or some a woman's is going to
[02:44:15] do the process of the creation of Life her energy collects in her belly so it's like sinking or in the like energy traditions of the east of you know the
[02:44:28] idea of we talked to Mark English about this of creating like uh your your next body being the pregnant man energetically like a big part of the technique is sinking the chi you sink
[02:44:41] your Chi down into your dantean so like there is this interesting thing you got to get down to get up you know what I mean you got to get up to get down you got to get down to get up like there's this Paradox to it for
[02:44:55] sure and so true uh another 510 that I didn't put into the slides anywhere but I thought it is relevant so the very same letters as how you spell rash you rearrange the letters and you
[02:45:09] get Sarai which is Abraham's wife which is the wife of Brahman same is rehea wife of Kronos same concept and also pertains to R Rivers you know they name Rivers after her in uh the Hindu it's
[02:45:24] Sarah Swati but it's the same thing Sarai or rash same letters and she's totally that but she's also Nicks you know she's the daughter of daughter of chaos she's the order born out of chaos
[02:45:38] which we see in the the scene following this big time because Nicks in Greek is new oilon and the old Greek he which is
[02:45:51] a different than the the newer she which is the both of them are kind of like an ex anyway we're going to move us on we're getting into some good weeds though like I like
[02:46:04] it yeah this is the last scene they come into a oh yeah this is a great oh yeah this is a really good word okay so another word that a 510 is where I'm
[02:46:18] pretty sure where we get the word elite so it's aen lamad Yad Tav like Alit olit in Hebrew and it means either it can
[02:46:31] mean an upper room or a loft which is where he's at he's in a loft it's to climb or to ascend well the sun is now climbing and ascending because it's we've reached the Dawn and also can mean
[02:46:43] Superior so I think this is the root of the word elite is the solar word uh aan lad yadav which is cool now where is my
[02:46:56] notes okay and yeah of course because he's the sun card he's rash he's the beginning figure it's fitting that he's got a loft for his quarters I mean I could be wrong but this looks like a loft to me that's just what it looks like maybe I'm wrong the mannequins in

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
02:47:11] here are also perfect symbolism for him as the Demi urge or creator of humanity at least in this metaphor he's creating their their Fates and their Destinies I mean why else would you have all these mannequins other than he's shaping and molding Humanity through his future to
[02:47:25] create the sacred timeline there's also in here a a Tesla orb that I thought was pretty cool where's my okay here we go this
[02:47:38] Tesla orb is like like on his desk so we're getting another cool connection to Tesla these orbs were patented in 19 1894 one
[02:47:52] year after this setting so maybe it's an acronym or maybe it was something that was known about previously or we're just supposed to see it and not think about it twice uh then he F then he digs out the invention that he was looking for
[02:48:05] the time uh throughput multiplier right and he holds it up it's just like you know it's just like the the battle horn or the Cornucopia or the raising of
[02:48:20] the Brazen serpent is all of this stuff the Hebrew phrase he lifted up a horn as it appears in Psalms is equal to 600 and I forgot to mention that Moses has horns and all the ancient depictions of him that's a
[02:48:35] thing so then then we get into this really weird uh part of the scene where all of a sudden Miss menes is like will you sketch me like your French girls she wants to know if there's a
[02:48:49] sketch of her her in the journal uh and she asked why didn't you allow me a real body and she's getting real Lusty and the word taffel is a 510 as a figure of speech it means folly or lentu isness or
[02:49:05] uncontrolled desire as a more literal meaning it actually is slime means slime or or untampered Mort like uh unrefined material you know and
[02:49:20] so that's also kind of like what these mannequins are they're they're unfinished they're unseasoned they're tasteless they're Bland they're blank they're all of that but she's got this Folly this uncontrolled desire that's that messes
[02:49:33] everything up actually so it's definitely Folly I mean this is the example of what I mean when I say like it's almost as if these episodes are written off of the gatria code because they just contain all of the different
[02:49:46] facets of the meaning of the numbers that go with the episode it's so weird she's she gets pretty biblical she starts talking about how you know she's been with them for eternity and she knows the beginning and the end of time
[02:49:59] and yada yada and then her her cartoon body which is just a head then it merges with the head of a mannequin that's it there's your rash it's a rash is the countenance the head
[02:50:11] or the face it's the beginning it's the commen it's wisdom it's all of that and there she is she's she's the goddess of in the beginning God created you know her and
[02:50:24] ren Slayer really are the Genesis 1:1 in Hebrew it starts with bashit Elohim which means not in the beginning it means by wisdom
[02:50:36] bashid elim Alim goddesses created so these are Rin Slayer and Miss minutes are the goddesses that in the beginning created and what did they create they created
[02:50:50] Adam which is Chronos the son of Heaven and Earth it's totally that but then uh he disables her because she's cray she super crazy too much he puts her down gotta put her
[02:51:11] down okay then Ren Slayer appears on the scene and her opening line is definitely an alysus ulyses
[02:51:24] T I'm I'm lost you there you muted too soon okay well Rin Slayer bursts into the scene and she's her her opening line is lovers Tiff and a tiff is a fight you need a weapon to fight she shows up with a
[02:51:39] weapon and on the lovers card is the letter Zen which means weapon he shows up and says lovers while holding a z a weapon I mean come on
[02:51:52] that's it you know like come on nice but also think back to me connecting her to um me connecting her to Theus who is a CO a creator of the cosmos figure that's also you're right I think about her switching to like the
[02:52:09] universe card cuz she shows up with the Baton that's on the universe card she totally does yes uh also the fact that the M that the uh The Magician's table is in this room
[02:52:28] uh that in fact there an entire room full of Magi tables and the Magi table has all of his Elemental tools a wand a sword a cup and a coin and so this
[02:52:42] entire room is yet again another territory that is inundated with inanimate objects that seem to move anyways that seem to have Wills of their
[02:52:54] own anyways and so all of these are the acutron of the Southern Hemisphere constellations it's just riddled with
[02:53:04] dead objects writing crops telescopes uh microscopes so I have a strong case that we are uh we are on the rim of Sigma octantis where um the indis
[02:53:19] constellation is uh surrounded by all of his tools and implements the telescope the microscope um and the entire shape of this room is hailing back to my discoveries on the anagram and the ARA
[02:53:34] alter constellation that particular shape of the corner of the altar is uh very much signified by this room uh large yeah it is it does have that odd
[02:53:50] trapezoid shape to it didn't think about that okay so she comes in and she says I'm the one in charge now and she means business she vaporized as a mannequin and well what do you know
[02:54:04] there's a word that means to take charge or to take over that's a 510 it's just an alternate rearranging of the letters that Spell rash it's Yan rash Shin there
[02:54:16] it is like y Yash to take over to take charge are you guys seeing how virtually every word that could correlate to the numbers I picked out for this episode are present in the
[02:54:29] episode if you go like go to uh a Hebrew gatria correspondence and just look up 510 and look up 200 I've pretty I've got most of the words worked into here and they they fit it's so
[02:54:43] weird and also remember there's other words like going like if you go back say um you could go back to previous words that I've brought up in this episode and they
[02:54:56] would apply here like the one of to burn there's a word that's a like part of the numbers I picked that is to burn something and here she is she's burning up the the mannequin so there I couldn't
[02:55:09] even really do full Justice to how comp complex The Weave of of this gatria program is throughout this episode it's crazy it is crazy but you know what chance I think I think it's important
[02:55:24] that we bring these uh artifacts together at least in uh in a as narrow of a location where they can be um uh
[02:55:35] organized our thoughts can be organized because the mannequin in Latin the word mannequin is a Mona a Mona is a mannequin it's a pet name for your sweetheart you know yeah
[02:55:51] Mona um well it's also Monica and Monica right away for me draws Monica linski back from The Archives of of time because Monica
[02:56:05] Lewinsky was a famous cat fight where an ice skater a dancing ballerina on the ice uh got in a battle and duped it out with another lady with another woman uh
[02:56:19] fighting over the Olympics uh so yeah the mannequin even is like pre-aging a cat fight an epic cat fight that's about to break out so it in a strange way it consummates the Monica Linsky debacle
[02:56:33] because here we are in this leap year we're going into another Olympic uh time frame and I think they're pre-aging some events in the Olympics probably dude this is totally written by AI the
[02:56:47] fact that they're drawing on multiple languaged puns that the Mona is the Monica this is totally written by Ai and it's designed to have latent triggers in multiple
[02:57:02] languages I want to make some shout outs I see Priscilla became a member to the channel thank you Priscilla we will have another inner World members only episode this week I just had to get this done
[02:57:14] first but we will do it also I see Jason AKA OA Jen he has super chated appreciate you man he's also a patreon subscriber so supportting extra love that over on The Rockin side I got some
[02:57:29] nice super chats from Ariel and Jason another Jason thank you guys y'all are awesome oh wow there's some good commentary in the The Rock fin side very cool just want to give my thanks to everybody that's supporting the channel
[02:57:44] makes it a lot easier to do this stuff now we're getting we're getting there we're almost to the end which is great I really like this part because it's like the whole culmination the heroes show up and they're like Rin Slayer what are you doing Loki's kind of playing a passive
[02:57:59] role in this section of the episode but Mobius is asking is this the Free Will you were looking for and this is where she's like you don't understand the rash the crown the
[02:58:13] leadership ship being the head the wise one in charge you have no idea what it takes to lead to act to keep order she says she says all that matters is order versus chaos and I'm
[02:58:27] order so this is a fun time to talk about that what what is the cosmos really you know we're told by science the science trademark that the universe is just this entropy machine that's
[02:58:41] eventually going to fizzle out into a you know you know from a big bang to a a pathetic whimper where all the heat is distributed evenly and nothing really has any motion or form anymore but it
[02:58:54] leaves out the intrinsic order in the cosmos and in fact that's what the word Cosmos means it refers to order and that which is adorned decorated artistically
[02:59:05] created and crafted and in fact Cosmos is a 600 that's a Kaa Omron Sigma moo Omron Sigma 20 plus 70 plus 200 plus
[02:59:18] 40 plus 70 plus 200 Cosmos is oh we also think that order sounds like aror which means ardor is a word for Love So Divine love is the force
[02:59:31] that brings order she's got she's definitely got tough love here uh she's you know she loves Victor timley but she's getting tough on him I'm in charge now Cosmos has the same meaning though as Moon the Latin word for world it's a
[02:59:45] word that is about beauty and Order and adornment and interestingly enough the Ethiopian African word Adama means exactly the same thing as cosmos and
[02:59:57] Mundi so there's another feather in the cap for the idea that I personally am entertaining pretty strongly that the original system was that Adam was the whole world that that's the Adam cadmon
[03:00:11] the archetypal man the first man was was the entire world itself but then the real chaos arrives which is Sylvie she bur in explodes everything with the green the green
[03:00:25] color of the heart which is important because the heart is we find like she seems like she's just pure chaos but we realize she's completely driven by heart she's all heart and why we are aware of
[03:00:37] that is because as she comes to pass judgment on Victor timely who said says I haven't done anything and she says you'll do terrible things she's about to shank him but at that point he's like that
[03:00:51] isn't me you don't know me you don't know the heart I have beating in my chest so amazingly the 216 shows up again in the word Arya which is lion
[03:01:04] same as AR similar to Ariel actually who just super chatted thanks for that but Leo is the sign in which the sun is exalted and it's also the sign of the zodiac that represents the heart it's also
[03:01:18] Rio uh if you do the LR swap which is a river in fact Ari is a word that can mean River think back to bakus and the German word Bach which is v a river or a stream Victor's also clearly got like
[03:01:33] his hair is his main feature you know he's a main character that's a very Leo trait but this word Nik nikan is a 216 in and it means Purity or
[03:01:45] innocence or cleanliness so she sees him and realizes his innocence which gives us the 216 and also want to point out that Divine love or wisdom which is the ordering Force order ardor according to
[03:02:00] Godfree Higgins was symbolized by the wearing of the heart symbol which is big I got to do more digging into that like the ancient use of the heart symbol or the heart that's with Jesus you know in the Sacred Heart of Jesus it's a lot of
[03:02:14] Catholic Catholic stuff but it's basically the idea is that Divine wisdom or Divine love same thing created in ordered the cosmos but one thing I also was like thinking about this whole
[03:02:27] episode is that uh this is a connection that's like a big far east to west reach is that in the iching 25 the hexagram 25 is innocence
[03:02:40] but it also can mean sacrifice the depending on who's translating from Chinese it can mean innocence or sacrifice which is kind of crazy uh you know like this this is uh the iching
[03:02:55] deck that I use and it's got the third eye of the Divine Child the Aries the ram the lamb the innocent one coming out of the third eye the Lotus it's all the symbolism of what I'm talking about but the fact that it's 25 is what is the
[03:03:09] most interesting sync because that's the same as the 205 of Aries in Hebrew which is rash plus hey if you just drop the zero you get 25 innocence in the iching the son and Aries the innocent part of
[03:03:23] the year the pure Lamb of God the newborn baby all of that and to top it off the two settings of this episode temporally 1868 when Victor was an innocent child
[03:03:35] to 1893 is a difference of 25 years but wait there's even more you know if we're thinking about
[03:03:44] 25s uh the 25th prime number is 97 and that 97 it gives you the word for speech in Hebrew 97 gives you the word
[03:03:59] for time in Hebrew and oddly enough pertaining to the speech of Victor timley he has a stutter the Hebrew word for stutter is like lamed gal me gal me so I'm not even
[03:04:14] going to try to pronounce that it' be like lag but if you take the values of that 30 * 3 * 40 * 3 * 40 the word for
[03:04:25] stutter he has a stutter you get 432,000 which is the length of the caluga it's uh 720 cycles of 600 720 neros it's the cuga there's all kinds of weird things
[03:04:41] when you start playing around with the numbers that I enjoyed but I especially was like whoa he's innocent she realizes he's innocent the whole episode theme is about his innocence and there's all these 25
[03:04:54] things going on yeah I thought it was huge huge so much so much yes so um 25 is uh five Time 5 the magical Square
[03:05:10] for Mars the 5x5 magical Square yields a 25 very correspondent to the Aries and the declaration of war marching into war
[03:05:24] getting the marching orders but the first thing that dies in war the first sacrifice is
[03:05:35] innocence and so everything we just laid out wow wow nice nice has a a thread of uh and also speaking of rivers that are
[03:05:49] incendiary or uh invoke the passions or the Manas the frenzies that is the river sticks that uh um uh Achilles is standing on when he gets his hair pulled by Athena and he
[03:06:05] goes into a hyperdimensional reality outside of time and space that is uh the universe card um but I want to also incorporate when ra ravona when she's
[03:06:19] holding the gun and she thinks that she has everybody under her thumb she says is that clear and everybody's like oh yeah that's clear well clear is Scientology speak for have you evacuated
[03:06:33] your soul and are you ready for somebody else to take take control of your will have you emptied the Council of sovereigns out of your uh faculties so somebody else can take control so when she says are we clear and everybody's
[03:06:48] got their hands in the air they're like yeah put your I'm Your Puppet tell me what to do next the and it turns out she was wrong they were not clear because now Sylvie comes in the room and she
[03:06:59] blows everybody to hell and then things are clear it's not clear when you're just using words and empty threats it's clear once the explosion has actually taken place and you know who's holding
[03:07:13] the power chance can you go back to the picture of the room exploding because the color of sylv's power is uh evoking the Dynamics of this card even the little sparkly
[03:07:27] twinkly sh yeah see how it's kind of glittered out the room is all glittered out that is so correspondent to this card right here it's beautiful and so who holds the power is not clear because
[03:07:41] you're standing there with a gun who holds the power is clear because the room is [ __ ] leveled and now we know who's got the real power here and then can you pull pull up the last graphic I
[03:07:53] sent you in the telegram this kind of summarizes the this uh conflict between the the three three forms of the divine feminine we have three men and we have
[03:08:06] three females there's a 33 going on uh in this room in a uh if you count Miss Min as gender oriented at all she's really a ba six which is spelled Shin
[03:08:21] Shin and shins are like a sideways three nice nice and equals 600 so uh this next graphic yep so this next graphic kind of you can see how I'm looking at the angle of the
[03:08:40] roof it's actually a different uh it's a different corner of the AR alter constellation but you get the gist of it and the AR alter is sometimes
[03:08:51] depicted as a oven or a a a furnace that is uh maybe has some mechanics some animation to it because it's uh generating smoke that can be captured and harnessed for steam power so the
[03:09:05] inanimate objects in motion of Mis minutes embodying the dummy the mannequin becoming the Mona the little doll so yeah the fact that he has all these love interests kind of coming out
[03:09:19] him at the same time it's almost like a uh it's kind of what happens to young attractive adolescents when they have too many love interests at once and they maybe they schedule two or
[03:09:33] three dates on the same night and all all the love interests have a conf floration of sorts not that that's ever happened to me at all but that does seem to be what's going on here and I love the fact that
[03:09:46] um remember in the universe card we have the telescopium in the microscopium which is the symbol of the uh military-industrial complex so the fact
[03:09:57] that there's a power struggle over who has command over this archetypal uh workstation is very profound because whoever controls the mic is holding the
[03:10:10] executive acts and so yeah there's a lot of Lusty vying for control all intrinsic to this uh to this scene right here and then um oh
[03:10:23] innocence I want to I want to put some Twilight spin on the phrase in war the first sacrifice is innocence I want to uh Echo this in a different light that
[03:10:36] in war the first uh skill that you're going to need in war is nonsense nonsense can be very tactically
[03:10:50] imp uh utilized and harnessed to your benefit when you're in a a strategically uh dire situation uh yeah sometimes just putting
[03:11:03] a little crazy on things uh turns the tables to your benefit just put it that way sometimes it's a competition who has the the most nonsense of no o
[03:11:20] sense I like where you're going with that I also like the comment from sky in the chat inner sense innocense I think that's sort of the idea that's being put
[03:11:32] forth in the iching version of everything and I there's just so many more like ways I could prove gatria points but I think I've beaten the horse
[03:11:45] pretty well and we'll just kind of move towards the uh the wrap up here so oh wrong wrong screen to share come on back all right so you know he proves his
[03:12:00] innocence through his heart and then we get Ren Slayer showing up uh getting up and timely gets away Rin slay is now ready to fight with
[03:12:13] Sylvie syl's like oh I don't need Revenge from you I've already killed you in my mind thousands of times and there is a a Biblical Hebrew word about revenge or exacting Vengeance or exacting
[03:12:27] attacks that's part of uh part of the weave here but she gets kicked through the door silie loves to kick people backwards through doors so they land on their ass somewhere unexpected turning people into
[03:12:40] fools and she winds up at the end of time with her God where she always wanted to be with the dead fisher king it's to go back to the first part of this episode to get the fisher king reference but it's definitely there
[03:12:53] especially the wounded you know the wounded uh Once and Future King that's it want some future Kang and oh wow he's all
[03:13:05] decayed uh and Miss minutes is there too and she realizes uh well it was foolish of him to make it in me out of someone who knows all his secrets secrets is another 510 in Hebrew if you if you
[03:13:19] spell it the right way but that's pretty much it we're gonna we're g to wrap it up bring it home we finished it around 3 hours and 11 minutes on 311 I think that's pretty special heck yeah um can you go back to
[03:13:37] the graphic where she lands in the tower uh in the uh the the realm Beyond because this this version of he who shall remain this uh he's decayed
[03:13:51] he's all he's dead and he's decayed this is card number da da look closely she lands right on that triangle right she's right on the triangle and look at the
[03:14:05] triangle that's hiding out in this card number D now what's amazing about this moment uh for one um the all the it's always been

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
03:14:19] fellas getting kicked by the ladies through the door this is the first time that a lady kicks another lady through the door which is pretty interesting the uh the kicking through the door is
[03:14:30] signified but in this moment my Star Card the dancer is actually coming in un
[03:14:43] to the number D and this is a combination look at the look at that scene you have the fortune card is him decaying with the the apple right the
[03:14:56] apple of Dick cord Discord and then she is the dancer who just landed right in the lap of his high tower and so this is very profound to me
[03:15:09] because before we uh two week ago these cards were not side by side these cards were divided by an entire inogram station and for the leap year I have ceremoniously brought them together and
[03:15:23] it is signifying this event right here in the uh in the series it is so profound what this is telling me chance there is consistency to my inogram that has been going on all
[03:15:36] along and so yeah for her to be uh thrown into this position uh at the very end the Pinnacle of this episode is quite profound uh can you pull up the last graphic I sent you I'm totally heading for the end for the Finish Line
[03:15:51] I promise I promise oh yeah we're good I'm having fun we're all having fun here but this uh this next awesome awesome this next graphic is um kind of
[03:16:03] corresponding your favorite gab you you have a crash on oh you're so right dude it's so Shameless and obvious dude they got me when I was young when they sent Wonder
[03:16:17] Woman through my Heavens I can't I can't look away she's totally Wonder it's amazing so yeah so kryptonia there it is bro there it is
[03:16:32] so um the firing off of the uh the battle of Troy uh the story of the IL of The Iliad is kicked off by this golden apple of discord uh rolled into the room
[03:16:47] that and it has the phrase for the fairest or for the finest and then the three goddesses get in a fight over who's gonna who this is intended for and
[03:16:59] so the the apple is kind of like a hand grenade because it explodes with all Discord and disas and I see these three ladies on the world stage uh being put in a
[03:17:14] position to kick off another uh another Iliad another fight over uh who's going to have control of the story going going future uh going forward in the future but part of the reason why this
[03:17:28] has a lot of um the artifacts is because the Olympics is taking place in Paris and Paris was the name of the
[03:17:41] judge who had to ch choose between Hera uh emis and Athena and they had to Duke it out over this apple of discord and so I just see them recreating the epics
[03:17:54] ceremoniously right in time for the word Paris to kick off another conflagration of a really significant and potentially ritualistic uh Global proportions it's
[03:18:09] really profound so yeah I just wanted to share this oh yeah that's really good because they can't resist well the apple of discord being
[03:18:20] the metaphor of who is the fairest of them all right Snow White in the poison apple um the Hera Aphrodite and Athena getting in a fight over who is going to
[03:18:34] be chosen as the most fair and isn't that what goes on here it's like it's Miss minutes it's RN slair and it's Sylvie and sy's going to just kill him because she's the third choice you know and he's kind of
[03:18:48] oscillating between the other two to decide who it is but it's it's kind of true and in fact this is the the Genesis of theoretically the multiversal war which is like the you know the
[03:18:59] macrocosmic fall of Troy that or battle for Troy that the apple of discard Discord insights and then here he is he still got the Apple at the end of the the end of the line you into the
[03:19:12] timeline you know uh Paris that Apple kills him Paris does not survive the whole ordeal interesting I like that weave a lot like that a lot
[03:19:25] totally yeah man and then uh uh and then can you pull up the most recent just one more little image because I did not know this until this
[03:19:36] project but her this is uh the Muse tacore this is the muse of dance and she is holding the triangle and this is not just any
[03:19:49] triangle now musically there's probably I'm missing a lot of context but just grasping at straws this to me is a Samba triangle the this triangle is an
[03:20:04] instrument of the Brazilian Samba music and that is so profound because I've already discovered many CAPA instruments and Brazilian artifacts in the tarot card but for the dancing Muse to be
[03:20:18] correspondent to the triangle it really brings these two cards together because this was tacore already and this was more of a atha the
[03:20:31] goddess of wisdom uh but now I'm seeing that I was supposed to fuse them together and in fact pulsy gabbard's name is just a few letters off from turp
[03:20:44] Sor and so I'm putting all my money on Tulsi gabard is gonna win because everybody else is ridiculous but I think ultimately the message the subconscious message that uh
[03:20:58] I think we could benefit from is movement movement esta movement will be life and the only way that they know that you're alive they still the textbooks still will
[03:21:12] prove this out the proof that you're alive is if they poke you with a stick and you move that is the scientific test for if you're alive guess what just happened a bunch of people got poked with sticks
[03:21:27] and came back for more they asked to be poked again and so movement esta is the essence of the Muse of dance and I'm taking this advice very personal I'm
[03:21:42] going to uh get back into my dancing uh I'm going to dust off my Capa boots for sure for the next uh 30 years can dance my way all the way to the Pearly Gates baby so yeah I just love knowing that
[03:21:56] tacore has been signified by the sacred triangle that is an artifact of the samba music from Brazil that's beautiful I love it you know tacor is the mother of the
[03:22:10] sirens did you know yes that is weird too that's weird too there's a lot more sirens and like you know surprise sudden for the
[03:22:22] ambulance after the whole movement living or dead test Big Time nice good call good call dang that's that's wild that's so wild these Muses are doing fine man
[03:22:41] they're doing fine they are calling shots on high levels of thought well I think they're just a version of the inad you know it's another it's all the same group don't listen to the sirens games Z
[03:22:58] recommends all right I think we're ready to I think we're ready to bounce you got any final thoughts buddy well uh yeah I would say uh the muses may be the inag or the
[03:23:15] inad but there's some of the most the most far out philosophers of modern time are now dabbling with the concept that numbers are
[03:23:29] alive numbers are alive and that is really nuts um yeah whatever that is is something to make me turn and run the other way um but I think that when um
[03:23:44] when JFK went to uh Germany and mispronounced the phrase ikb Berliner he said it wrong and then history went back and everybody
