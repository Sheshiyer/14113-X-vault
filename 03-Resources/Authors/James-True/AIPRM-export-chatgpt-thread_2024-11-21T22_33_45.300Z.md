[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:07] good morning hi let me uh check the audio glad you guys could be here it's raining here in a nice way the birds are making more noise
[00:25] because of it which i love that volume looks good and then that volume looks good so i think i think we're ready to go it's here how's that all right um big news
[00:46] good morning good morning everyone missouri shipmoth i laughed so hard when i see your name kander kristen kimbo power that bears uke of dork that's a good one too mlvp audio is good
[00:59] great um i i oh i'm so excited i i i'm i'm really really excited i i i haven't prepared a show again for you
[01:18] um i've i finished my book last night and when when i say finished my book what i mean is is that um is that i am done writing it and i've sent the final few chapters to my wonderful editor
[01:31] and uh um it's it's all good i i went ahead and did a pre-release of the kindle version of the book um you will find a link in the stream below so if you do have kendall you could
[01:46] actually get it now but i'm looking forward to showing the paperback with you after the finish and i get the dedication done the acknowledgement's done there's a lot of people to thank for this book
[02:00] and um that's something i can't rush but i did want to get it out on my on my birthday because it's been really it's been four years that book has has been four years of research and work
[02:15] and i thought that it'd be a great show if there's a hair on me there here i thought it'd be a great show if we uh actually discuss some of the really cool tenants uh inside that book um tenants that that i've been exploring
[02:29] for a long time and uh tenants that i started exploring before i uh awokened or began to bloom in a consciousness way like we all do
[02:44] ideas that had to be changed and challenged and destroyed and i think you're gonna really dig these things because they've been they've lasted through four years of scrutiny which is not easy to do with the apocalypse the way it is um not
[02:57] easy to do at all and uh volume is very low okay um you know sound preferences
[03:08] inputs external microphone oh maybe this is oh i had it on this microphone that's probably a lot better isn't it um that's probably a lot better
[03:26] i bet you that's tons better but i think that's so this is with mike and now [Music] and now this is the uh if this works great if you'd rather me go back to the corded one you'll need to put that in
[03:41] the chat sorry about that i had uh the thing plugged in i was i i keep trying to see if i can make audio better um and it's it's uh such an amateur uh problem i'm having with it stop with
[03:56] the sound checks yeah i got you that this kind of sounds good here okay good good good i'll keep moving i want to start with polyvagal theory i would like to discuss with you
[04:09] um another input into the body another input that is very personal another input that is so deep it doesn't have the language restrictions
[04:21] placed on it for example if you were a if you were a man growing up before this inversion of sexuality happened if
[04:36] if you were to be a man before then if you were to like the color pink as like a 12 year old there would be a force field as a boy there would be a force field
[04:48] making that color difficult to enjoy you would be polarizing yourself into your rational thinking ego which is all good by the way all this is is necessary to to build our our self
[05:02] to build ourself we have to uh begin to oppose the world it's it's why we rebel against our parents it's why we rebel against school our teachers all that stuff it's it's um it's so it's necessary okay this is not
[05:17] uh let's not demonize how important it is to develop the self and to develop the self you need to push other things away and the color pink to a boy is just the first example i could think of
[05:30] of something that um that let's say that boy is a young painter and and he really wants to use pink in a painting but he's got that electrical field that's stopping that he's like i can't use pink and i
[05:45] really if i had more pubic hairs i could get away with it but i don't yet and i i just can't do this this is a legitimate electrical field and uh it's a part of our system the polyvagal theory
[05:58] is we talked about this briefly before it's a theory by dr steven porges uh dr prges i spelled that for you so you you you can look it up yourself in fact if anyone wants to throw
[06:13] a link to the pdf that would save me from having to look it up but but basically um dr steven porges uh put forth a theory it's not a theory he described the polyvagus nerve this nerve system
[06:27] that wraps around your uh major organs in your chest and this is a constriction nerve it's an electrical neurological constriction it's it's
[06:39] uh it's a polarity current it's just like that fear of pink but it's inside your body and your neocortex applies um a blanket
[06:53] of thou shalt not like pink on top of this underlying limbic response to something you have an unfettered
[07:08] uncensored living entity inside you it's your it's your reptilian core and this is where people are gonna freak out oh my god he's talking about
[07:20] reptilians he's saying we're reptilians i get that and and welcome welcome this is a good fighter you can bash your head against these rocks these rocks are made for the head bashing it's okay this is a
[07:35] safe space to do that this reptilian core inside you has its own opinions it has its own uh urges its own beliefs it's your intuition it's your inner chewbacca
[07:49] chewbacca doesn't have a language chewbacca is he is feeling he's in motion he's not syllabi right he's he doesn't fit in the plastic cups
[08:03] that are dipped in the river of language he doesn't drink from that river it's impossible he waits for it to rain and he opens his mouth and he gobbles up what he can this
[08:15] inner child this inner this inner creature inside you has a a stake in your destiny and you need that stake you need that intuition this is your gut
[08:36] feeling of all the sudden you walk into a room and you're like something's not right something's not right something's not right and then something not right happens right that's what i'm talking about
[08:49] you have this inside you and dr steven porges um explains how this this vagus nerve system how it connects how how how it wraps around the heart the the stomach
[09:03] the lungs the i think the liver i think it's the liver might be the kidneys i think it's the liver though it's uh is trying to communicate to you but most of us like those guys in the corner
[09:18] that are freaking out right now they have demonized that reptile they've created a species of alien creatures called reptilians and because they're aliens they're from zetty reticuli you're able to push them away you can
[09:33] push them as far away as a star system to make you feel safe right to give you that electrical feel that it's okay what most people have done is they've taken that reptilian core because it's been demonized
[09:46] and they've exercised it they've pulled it out of their cockpit through disassociation and they've said you're bad i can't trust you i'm going to send you to zeta reticuli
[09:58] now and it sends it off and now that you have a reptilian living on zeta reticuli you have um a blue space chicken from jordan's ather
[10:12] you have a david wilcox telling you about the the uh antithesis of the reptilian the the bird the um it's the white hat to the black hat is what it is it starts with the
[10:26] demonization of your core and then it allows people to come in and build a savior they build a technology that can be placed in between you and your projection right you projected that all the way
[10:41] across the universe into zeta reticuli your fear of your reptilian core is now all the way out there so you have that entire plasma string that's now a complete waste of energy it's not a waste it's keeping you safe
[10:55] okay it's keeping you safe and that's important i want all of you to feel safe all of you should feel safe so i take that back that was that was bad i'm pruning my lips there but you it requires energy best
[11:13] apocalypse ever cali thank you so much for the super chat i could not agree more best apocalypse ever ever ever ever
[11:26] erwin irwin so you're pushing this reptilian core out to the zeta reticuli and you're burning all this prana all the king your prana from it and he's getting fat as he's sucking that prana from you
[11:42] and then jordan sather comes with his blue space chicken corey good comes then the military comes and they start feeding you all these stories and then graham hancock tells you that the shafts in the pyramid
[11:56] are pointing to those stars he calls them star chambers he calls them shafts of starlight that were built with such precision to align with the stars so that that starlight could come in and
[12:14] give birth to this cosmic reptilianesque uh entity and never never once does he tell you the truth that the star shafts
[12:31] are not straight that his starlink shafts that graham hancock tells you we're real i should be able to do this i can't there we go that's so hard to trace that
[12:44] those star shafts aren't even straight the starlight comes down a shaft yes but then it has to turn one of those tunnels it has to turn twice the other one it has to do a sweeping turn
[12:59] but graham hancock is on that tit too he's on that reptilian plasma tit he's telling you about asteroids that are coming to kill you these pedophile asteroids are on the way all these people are using your
[13:12] demonization of your reptilian core the ones of you who have cast your see check it out all of us have rejected our core some of us have rejected it to the limits of space we've said it's the zeta reticuli and those are the reptilians and those are
[13:27] the evil ones others of us have restricted it to the vatican it's a snake cult look at the shape of the vatican building right the pope's viewing chamber
[13:40] right the uh oh my gosh like it's so obvious it's such a snake cult right it is but we've taken our inner core and we've given it to them they've they've actually known they're the one of the first ones
[13:54] to take their fangs and bite it into that umbilical cord and before we had enough technology to send our uh reptilian core to space
[14:08] we sent it down into a pit we tried to bury it we sent it as far away from ourselves as we could so that we would feel safe so that electrically we would feel safe this is what racism is by the way
[14:22] if if you call someone a racial slur what you're really doing is that you're setting up an electric field to provide distance and so if you accent the difference between you anything that you can accent that makes you different from someone else
[14:37] uh the color of your skin their wardrobe how much money they have where they live right their religion what what their favorite team is as long as you uh to create soothing right to self-suit the neocortex we provide an electrical
[14:53] distance we provide an electrical field and that electrical field is manifested in our mind palace as distance so when you say something racist to someone what you're really doing is that you're taking them and pushing them as far away as you can
[15:08] if you're calling them an idiot what you're doing is that you're putting yourself up higher above them and you're pushing them way down on this mountain of intellect it that provides you with distance that's why when you call someone an
[15:21] idiot you actually don't have confidence it's actually your lack of confidence that's causing you to do that everything is an electrical field i want you thanks for the super chat nice day everyone i agree illumi
[15:36] every one of us has this uh important part of setting an electrical field we need that to create distance we need that to feel safe it's how we save calories
[15:48] it creates a fetish for the butcher we have a fetish for paying others to do our dirty work because paying a butcher to slaughter your food is providing an electrical field of
[16:02] distance between you and what it takes to sustain yourself yesterday i told you that a turkey that you find in the woods you're out wandering the woods and you see a wild turkey
[16:17] that turkey is not the size of his plumage that turkey is the size of his vision your vision of that turkey is an encroachment into that turkey's electrical field you
[16:32] two have merged right two bubbles of consciousness have merged and if that turkey doesn't see you but you see it that is a uh
[16:46] that's dc but if you two see each other that's ac it's an alternating current it's a different kind of energy it's a different kind of experience most of us don't understand how
[17:01] important our shadow is a shadow is your eternal witness look at the perils of the invisible man you see an insanity that rises when one doesn't see his reflection in the world the son is here to tell you i see you
[17:18] even when no one else sees you i see you and i can prove it because look at your shadow i see you i see you this is an electrical field too
[17:32] it's a constant connection to us saying it's okay it's okay even when no one else sees you i see you so all these electrical fields i'm talking about these are not flaws these are not things you're supposed to fix quite the contrary
[17:45] you would not have a self if you did not learn to dislike something you would not have a self if you did not learn how to project something that you do not like inside you outside of yourself we
[17:58] need rational tangible tools in the world to not only put food into our tourists and swallow it for digestion but to take plasma energy from inside of ourselves like pain regret remorse and expunge them from our
[18:14] system i can exp expunge remorse by saying i'm sorry i am i am uh spitting i am it's no different than saying
[18:28] repent or you're a sinner as it is to say i am sorry something inside of your field is coming out right and by it coming out the remorse
[18:40] is an electrical cyst right it's an electrical cyst inside your system and by saying you're sorry that cyst is coming out it's we are electrical beings everything's the same guys except for we're electrical beings now
[18:54] that's all and as far as someone can see you that's how big your electrical field is and that could be a good thing it could be a bad thing it could be that you're compromised because your electrical field is so far
[19:06] that it's up in the zeta reticuli and as we start to come to grips with the aperture around us as it's suggesting we are seeing new entities we are seeing new ideas we are seeing new things we are seeing new cosmology that we did not see before
[19:22] and it will become important for some of us to take those things and project them somewhere they can project them into the zeta reticuli or they can project them into the ground in
[19:34] an underground military base we can project our fear of entities that are flying around and dismiss them
[19:48] all the way to space are into the military in roswell it's it's whatever is happening around you is always going to be evidence of your electrical field of what you're feeling what you're
[20:02] sensing and what you have i get contacted by ti's almost daily and it's it's hard it's hard it's hard love to talk to them because the most important thing i have to tell them is the truth
[20:21] i don't see what you see but i don't think you're crazy i think you're having an experience and i think ti's are legitimately good at projecting their plasma they're so good at it that their aperture is able to see what it is they
[20:38] projected this is what paranoid schizophrenia is it's the power of plasma projection when you project it strong enough you
[20:49] have a uh spooky spooky action from a distance your your plasma stream is able to be a communication device if it's an ac connection when you see a
[21:04] turkey and the turkey sees you even though you don't speak english you have an electrical connection don't you both of you can communicate that turkey will communicate all right back off i did not expect to see you i'm gonna need at least 17
[21:18] minutes to fly up this tree okay and while you're waiting for me to get up the tree i want you to pretend like you're running as fast as you can at me because i have to maintain my dignity and i being someone that loves the turkey is
[21:32] willing to do that for that turkey i know that i could catch that turkey but i want him to feel better about my experience of me finding him so as he's flying away oh i'm running away he's hitting every tree his tree limb as
[21:47] he goes up he's still the proud bird that he thinks he is and i still get to enjoy the beauty of that experience we have an ac connection now not a dc connection
[22:01] it's a completely different experience and that's really uh the difference between truth and compassion dc is truth ac is compassion ac overrides the need for it to be true
[22:15] what's more important is the compassion that's that's really the the key and that's that's gonna start by taking our polyvagal theory our limbic system and bringing it
[22:29] back home and placing it back into our adrenals wrapping it around our gonads internal or external wrapping it around all of our lymph nodes and rewiring connecting ourselves back
[22:43] to our antenna it's that round antenna that used to come on the back of a record player that's never been hooked up it's like oh you don't need that well why don't you need that well because you know you just don't need that you listen to records you don't listen to the radio you don't listen to
[22:58] the universe list the records and it's just a matter of wiring that back in and you create this ac connection again with the world
[23:10] so this this novel talks about that interface it talks about how you could technologically communicate with that interface and one of the ways it does that is
[23:26] through pupil dilation your your pupils are connected to your polyvagus nerve it's not really that they're connected but but there is a
[23:38] tremor that you see in your pupils when your polyvagus nerve constricts um everything i'm about to say i cannot prove anymore i the last i got to was i was in canada talking to
[23:55] um man if you guys are freaking out about reptilians wait do you hear me say the word fbi i was talking to uh an fbi uh corpora it's a corporation that that had funded this product for the fbi and it
[24:08] was a lie detector test it was at a uh a technology conference i did some augmented reality for that conference i actually wasn't related to them but i found them in the booth the uh the pupil dilation
[24:21] is used as a lie detector test which of course the government would use this how can we use this to to hurt people but i'm deduced from that that what that's really doing is sensing the polyvagus
[24:36] nerve the dilation is sensing the polyvagal nerve and instead of using this as a lie detector test you could use it as a truth detector test you could actually turn it on yourself see the fbi has it where it's inside of their machine is pointing at you
[24:51] and i'm saying you could take this technology and turn it on yourself and ask yourself questions you could ask your limbic system questions and it would give you an answer through a little squeak
[25:03] of your pupil 250 milliseconds before your neocortex could decide before your neocortex could say hey now let's not be talking about pink you're 12 now don't be talking about the color pink before your neocortex gets a chance
[25:18] to stifle the limbic answer which is 250 milliseconds behind this device connects to that dilation and gives you
[25:30] your chewbacca it gives your chewbacca a voice and what's fascinating about this technique is that because it has to be so quick that voice can only be a binary input this is why my book's gonna blow your freaking mind
[25:45] this is why i need this is why i would like for you to buy this book instead of making me explain it to you because it's really deep stuff you're chewbacca is able to answer yes
[25:58] or no limbically by squeezing its its pupil you could show your chewbacca a picture
[26:08] of a brussels sprout and a piece of cherry pie and you could ask your chewbacca which one does it want which one would bring it more joy you would ask it that here's what's so
[26:26] blunt mind-blowing about you would ask it that by finding which one and this elicits a pain reaction which which picture elicits a reaction of oh i don't like that and by doing that you have a subtle
[26:40] measure of how much your tobacco rejects or likes an idea and i believe that if someone was to perfect this technique um by the way i tried to to take this to
[26:54] market but no one would believe me but but it's it's it's down there uh polyvagal theory look it up look it up um it it
[27:06] this interface could be used as a mouse an input interface where you could have the most honest conversation you could ever imagine with yourself
[27:23] i mean profound truth because you could talk to yourself without the neocortex projecting all the fear you would have a pure raw look as if you
[27:37] could open your chest and look directly at your soul and say there you are and when i say there you are you're going to see something that you're going to be ashamed of you're going to see something that
[27:52] you're like this should not be out in the mall this should not be allowed to be here i'm talking about a primal root u this primal root u does not have manners this primal
[28:04] root u does not understand the social fabric of the neocortex it doesn't have the mammalian brain to broadcast and spend all these
[28:18] warm-blooded calories on empathic connection this is purely about your primal urge it's your inner wookie
[28:43] and i'm not going to make this about the book i i promise but that's what the book's about it's called quantum rapture and right now it's only out on kindle because my awesome editor um i is still

The speaker underscores the importance of reconnecting with primal instincts and intuition, often likening these to the "reptilian core" or "inner Chewbacca."</p><p>Critically, the speaker critiques societal tendencies to demonize aspects of human nature, using the metaphor of projecting fears (such as reptilian traits) onto external entities. They discuss the neurological basis of emotional responses and propose using pupil dilation as a tool to access subconscious truths, contrasting this with conscious filtering by the neocortex.</p><p>Beyond its scientific applications, the speaker suggests practical uses of these insights for personal introspection and development. Their work encourages readers to explore deeper levels of self-awareness and to embrace aspects of their nature often marginalized or misunderstood by society.</p>
