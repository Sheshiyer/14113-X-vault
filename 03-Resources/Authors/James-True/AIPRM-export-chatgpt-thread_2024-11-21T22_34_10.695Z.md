[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] [Music] what do you say
[00:27] [Music] i'm crazy so many times i'm
[01:05] [Music] um [Music] something quite unique
[01:44] [Music] true i think i'm crazy [Music] is
[02:24] [Music] [Music] just
[02:48] [Music] looks like there's some birthdays
[03:10] i i i was putting my clothes on so somebody was somebody was born on this day is that is that hot it feels like maybe that's too you guys let me know uh i'm not muted i'm not muted i know you
[03:23] can't see me uh hello now you can um good to see everybody let me see here i'm still getting set up a little bit i was uh doing some more reading this morning
[03:41] always what is it with this guy he's always he's always reading you know sometimes when i get in arguments with people uh on twitter they try
[03:56] to make fun of me because i write books and and i think that that when you look at this uh i'm coming back now and when you look at this uh trend
[04:12] i think it's hilarious i think it's one of the beautiful things about life that reveals itself is when you you get to see someone's true like their inner resolve is you suck because
[04:25] you spend a lot of time putting words on a page and then and then you offer that to other people and people are buying it they're like purchasing your book yeah you're so you're so wrong and then they then they try and use the title as if it's
[04:39] something to make like one guy said yesterday he was like oh and you wrote a book with oh oh it's got apocalypse in the title and i'm like yeah yeah best apocalypse ever
[04:53] 12 900 year long cycle written about through ancient history you and i are on the precipice of this fort and this beautiful woman of time has
[05:07] dipped her fork into this cheesecake and it's strawberry and she's placing it in her lips and you and i are watching it you're damn right you're damn right it has apocalypse in the title and let
[05:20] me tell you something it's coming for you it's coming for all of us and that's why we're here that's why we're here i really want to encourage everyone to uh enjoy the show today
[05:34] and uh so why don't why don't we do that now we've been talking a lot about uh uh all kinds of stuff right this goes back to uh
[05:49] episodes i don't know almost 10 episodes ago and i've regretted that we had to end the show exactly where we did last time but we were really pushing on this this arc idea and i want to talk today about the birth
[06:04] of noah and to get here you really have to have excuse me um you really have to have been watching our previous shows some of you are going to see one example
[06:17] of something here and you're going to think oh well that's just one example so what are you writing a book or something oh you're a book writer now are you like a writer or something like what do you do he's like i'm a certified public accountant
[06:32] for the uh uh state administrative board working for the uh outlying right anyway um it's arguing it's fun it's it's uh it's
[06:48] better than war it's uh i actually haven't been arguing a lot but uh um i did i did make some thoughts about the let's let's say focus james you got a huge huge show and make sure there's
[07:02] get your yeah get your pages off my damn dirty okay okay good um everything's working well and so you know what if you if you don't understand the show dude you gotta watch my other stuff
[07:15] you gotta watch my other stuff to get us kicked off here i want you to i'm putting a planet on the screen that's how important this idea is is that i want you to actually think about this planet i want you pour your plasma into this idea that there's a
[07:29] planet and that planet's called mars and that you have to colonize that planet you and i were like how are we going to colonize mars it turns out elon musk was right the entire time
[07:44] it turns out that dude is like a the guy who named his his daughter backslash seven four uh xvr uh dot two
[07:57] uh that that dude was totally right and and and so there you are okay so how do we colonize mars do we send two humans in a bottle of wine do we have an american idol where we pick the
[08:11] grand adam and the grand eve right where simon cowell is on the stage going eve do you do you think you could bite the apple with a little bit more passion w
[08:24] do not eve don't swallow it this is not this is not a giant reality show where we're picking american idol it's this is america's eve yes yes yes caress the i believe good
[08:36] adam can you blame all of your decisions on this wench eve can you do that can you guys do that i think you're horrible right that we do we pick the adam and eve and do we
[08:52] send those to packing to mars with a case of wine and some candles do some little little blue pills you know is is that is
[09:05] that really the best idea do we do we send a freeze-dried packet of 12 surrogates right and 12 men and just hope it works out
[09:18] and not really concern ourselves with inbreeding if that's a thing i have to say if it's a thing because i don't [ __ ] know yes i know that that there's a lot of words out there and yes i know about the blue people of kentucky
[09:32] i did a [ __ ] paper on it i thought it was fascinating too but it still doesn't actually say that that was caused by inbreeding you don't know why they were blue look it up if you have no idea what i'm talking about so how do we colonize mars
[09:45] how do we do it and before we even say this i probably should have started with this live but in 1873 this dude heinrich schleiman yeah this is heinrich slymon i'm here to see your daughter
[10:04] he said that to someone and and that he found the mythological city of troy and before heinrich did his thing there was no troy troy was a myth it was a silly myth it's like
[10:17] oh it's such a great myth oh i love it i love miss hey we found troy what and yeah this keeps happening it doesn't keep not happening it keeps happening we aren't telling each other stories about hey remember that time where we thought this is
[10:32] something but then it turned out not to be something okay well we do that with the moon i'll give you the moon we do that with the apollo program but but but we're finding out all the time that what we thought was mythological is real so none of what i'm told you right now is a stretch none of it none of it unless you're
[10:47] heinrich's schleiman he's doing some stretching now um so this idea actually i i probably shouldn't show you that because to start us off we need to
[11:01] talk about the birth of noah and the father of noah this is lamech on the left he's holding his uh glowing baby noah uh his his lovely wife is is watching him and lamechas is
[11:16] pissed he's pissed off at his wife why because noah is like glowing white he's a he's an albino he's an albino baby
[11:29] and i thought to myself the pregnancy is from the watchers and the seed is from the holy ones and the nephilim in my mind was greatly disturbed on account of the child then i lumek became perturbed and i went into my wife batinosh
[11:43] and said now when my wife bad enough saw that my continence was to serve she curved her passion saying to me oh my master my master my brother my cousin my youthfulness i swear to you by the great holy one by the king of
[11:56] heaven that this seed is from you lamack that you and me look remember that trip we took down down past the birding bush remember that you me we had that bottle of wine and you told me about thorns and i didn't know that
[12:12] about thorns and then you told me you had a thorn in your pants and i didn't know what you meant and then next thing you know i'm pregnant that was you lamech that the planting of this fruit is yours it is not from these strangers or these watchers or of these sons of heaven
[12:26] lameck that's not that's not who it is it's okay it's okay and lamech got so upset and you know what uh baddie nush lamech was like man i've been hearing these rumors of
[12:40] dudes going around telling me that their wife is pregnant but they were at sea and then the wife told them that it was a virgin birth and i just think that sounds really suspect to me that lamech was having all
[12:55] those thoughts and like i don't know if i can believe her i don't know if i can believe her me and my wife bat we do not have a strong emotional relationship we don't like checking with each other and so i
[13:08] have some trustees with you so lumet goes to his father and it's like dude i'm about to about to kill this [ __ ] she's she's been sleeping around and we haven't gotten to who these watchers are we haven't even gotten to that we
[13:20] haven't even gotten to that right and his father knows his father knows he's like no dude you don't understand that albino thing that's it's all good it's not even you lumek it's me
[13:34] that is the weave and the waff coming through and uh and you and i are a different kind of machine we are a genetic uh slot machine
[13:49] you know how lamech can go to a truck stop and you can walk in the bathroom and all of a sudden there's a metal machine right in front of the urinal and it's offering to sell your condoms and you're you're like this is like the last place i want to
[14:02] even think about purchasing some sort of prophylactic for my member that instead of that machine being that way it's the opposite that it is a uh there are are planted
[14:16] virgins human virgins waiting for your seed on this earth and that you're here to have sex with them and this is a
[14:28] uh a fascinating idea right it's very self-fulfilling if you're a giant to have these thoughts but you're living in a time where the giants and the nephilim the fallen ones are doing something very important
[14:41] they're they're they're they're directly tied into breeding before we get to the breeding though i want you just to understand this idea of noah being an albino because
[14:55] it's not really related but it is related noah's line was chosen because of his ability to perceive and see the lord
[15:08] whatever you want to call the lord okay doesn't matter at this point there was something about him about his makeup that allowed him he was chosen because he could be in this presence
[15:22] moses too same same kind of idea the mechanics of your first eye the thing that actually perceives reality inside the center of your skull the hanging sonar dome though that hanging sonar dome that
[15:39] needle on the record of what you perceive right is being routed through your amygdala i feel like you guys are repeating it because i say it all the time but it's being routed through your amygdala back to your occipital lobe and then back up through filtered
[15:52] through the amygdala from an emotional temperament standpoint before it comes down to paint the picture into your eyes it paints the picture inside of your eyes and that that process is run by melanin
[16:06] and dopamine melanin is the black ink that you know about it's actually not black but that the ink it gives you the coloring of your skin but also the coloring of your eyes that the reason why your eyes are that color is actually because of
[16:19] melanin and the shape the crevice of the nautilus of your iris creates that color that it is it's not a dye it's a shape and the bouncing of that shape off the
[16:34] hollowed halls of melon and make that color your eye this melanin is everywhere in your body it's not a pigment designed to make you racist or not racist that no no this is how we
[16:49] modern society man bear pig tries to explain away how reality works that melanin is the is a effervescent canvas that you use to paint reality and you're allowed to shade it because you don't want it to be
[17:03] too bright it works in line with dopamine and does the the same kind of thing noah had no break noah had no ability to apply melanin
[17:18] he perceived full source light all the time the volume was always at 11 the reality volume the source volume itself if you want more information about this topic i have a stream called the eye of raw and you could just check it out i'm not
[17:34] trying to sound like a commercial but there's there's a lot of back we're building on a lot of stilts today i want if anyone's curious this is a fascinating read it took me a while to find it and uh
[17:50] it's it's describing uh the offspring of the angels and the reconstructed fragments of noah's albinism by j by tracing it
[18:03] through his family roots it's it's just fascinating reed and i just wanted it on the screen so if anyone did want to read it it's there
[18:15] the albinism is just one part of of these giant stories the nephilim stories and that noah remember was chosen as a protoplast a
[18:29] first human actually he's not even the protoplast he's the the vessel and this vessel this ark is um has certain characteristics that genetically you and i are not going to
[18:43] necessarily reflect or share right now one of those is this albinism and i think that when you're looking at what the nephilim were i think you're probably looking at a lot of albinos and if you look at all the legends whether
[18:58] it be quetzalcoatl to uh to the yeti i mean you know across the world you have this this idea of this albino uh super ubermensch
[19:13] kind of kind of character there is an arc of of darkness and i've we've talked about this before there's i've told you the stories that that when you look at the we just
[19:33] covered this four episodes ago but when you look at the evolution of noah's ark before that it was the preserver it was a box the preserver was a box
[19:46] and that box i think i have the that box the preserver of light wasn't wasn't made seaworthy this wasn't constructed
[20:00] by by gilgamesh or this in the story of gilgamesh this this box was not constructed by ubdu because it floated no it was constructed because it sealed
[20:14] out light so that the rays of shamas the sun would not shine in it was this story of the ark was added later when suddenly this box became an
[20:25] ocean going vessel and you know who wrote that people that wanted to understand people that wanted to understand says oh well you know it's because of the delusion that means water so
[20:41] uh we need to no one's going to believe that you're floating cube man we need to turn this into an ark and so they did and do you want to know why the do you want to know why the cubits are listed in the bible doing why
[20:56] because they wanted people to own to think of it as a boat and uh turns out that uh you know the reason why the those measurements are so seaworthy is
[21:10] because they were pulled from a boat and did you know that that ark wasn't even huge back then that that there were ships in the mediterranean sea at the time that had those same dimensions
[21:24] this is not a truth movement is it it's a comfort movement and when no one's looking scribes will change and tweak the story to stop people from freaking out right
[21:37] to stop or to encourage people to freak out huh or that right he hid himself in an ark i'll just read this whole thing and he repented for all that had happened through him he plotted to produce a
[21:56] flood over all the offspring of man but the greatness of providence which is the reflection of the light instructed noah and he preached to men but they did not believe him it is not as moses said he hid himself
[22:10] in an ark but she sheltered him in a place not noah alone but men from the immovable race the immovable rays they went into a place and sheltered
[22:23] themselves with a luminous cloud and he noah recognized his lordship and those who were with him in the light would shone upon them because darkness was falling over everything
[22:38] upon earth darkness not water darkness the world was forgetting and it forgot a lot oh [ __ ] i thought this was up i'm so sorry
[22:53] man i'm sorry i need to watch my my screens better and that's the uh that's the preserver that's what this box is did you know that on the top floor they had fresh water
[23:06] they had a lake built into this thing on the top floor they wanted the covering they wanted this thing to be a water shield they were blocking out the uh incoming darkness and sustaining themselves
[23:23] inside a shrine of light that was only inside the box they could not have the light go elsewhere light and source is information source your pioneer your pineal is reading that
[23:37] source and it's painting is it as sound later it's painting it as as color in your eyes later right
[23:49] all those things are happening later let's watch this gotta get the volume on melanin is a versatile molecule not only is it responsible for giving us our uv blocking complexion at the cellular level it gobbles up harmful
[24:13] radicals that lead to diseases such as cancer and parkinson's but that's only the beginning over the past decades researchers have focused on what might be melanin's most promising talent yet discovered the
[24:26] ability to conduct electricity that's important because if we fancy a future where environmentally benign electronics help us fight disease monitor our health and store energy we're going to need bio-friendly materials
[24:41] and what better material for the job than one made right in-house this is melanin in its most common form when it comes to electrical charge melanin acts as a sort of bank always
[24:54] ready to lend out or take electrons depending on the environment chained together as they naturally tend to do melanin molecules can shuffle electrons and surrounding ions end to end the result is an all-natural electrode
[25:08] material in terms of performance it's not on par with the electronic materials we find in our phones and laptops but because melanin is 100 compatible with our body's makeup it's a much safer starting
[25:21] material for building electronic devices both for us and the environment researchers have shown that melanin can act as a switch when sandwiched between metal electrodes turning on and off under different applied voltages
[25:36] it seems like a simple trick but that switching behavior is critical to the operation of any computing device polydopamine a synthetic melanin analog has been used to extract harmful metal ions from water
[25:50] and polydopamine coated nanoparticles have been shown to boost the sensitivity of tests designed to seek out diseases like hiv zika and cancer researchers are still learning how melanin behaves when surrounded by the
[26:04] machinery that makes useful electronics work but continued efforts from chemists physicists and material scientists are likely to result in exciting new applications for this highly versatile molecule
[26:20] oh there's some credits there thank you mrs.org uh uh pretty cool right pretty cool kind of backs up everything we've been talking about oh my goodness it's
[26:34] it's still playing kind of backs up everything that that we've been uh we've been talking about that i've been talking about that i've been telling you about what reality is about what source reality is inside your inner ear where no light ever shines
[26:47] there in melanocytes secreting melanin why are they secreting menelanin manilan why are they secreting melanin because they are absorbing what the amygdala sent to it to hear
[27:02] remember melanin absorbs or it puts out melanin is piezoelectric isn't it isn't it the video just told you that source information is absorbed inside
[27:16] the squids ink of melanin it's hidden from you because your amygdala said if you show this to this dude sitting in the cockpit right now
[27:31] he's gonna freak out and he's probably gonna poo his pants and this really gonna be embarrassing and i don't think he's gonna recover so let's not show him that let's just
[27:45] turn that down and your body's like no problem i will no problem i will secrete some melanin i will just simply secrete melanin oh there i've just i've squirted melanin
[27:58] out of my melanocytes now he cannot hear the breathing of god in his ear going hey you going to eat that he doesn't hear it and that you and i would have to have
[28:11] that because we would freeze when during the first sun or the second son of the third sun when they made adam and eve they didn't have melanocytes no one had thought about it and all these adams and neves were running around then god's like hey i'm gonna go say hi and they're like okay cool that'll be cool i'm gonna watch and then they're watching god
[28:27] comes down it's like hey guys and everyone just falls over and faints they're freaked out you just showed them your manifestation of god they can't [ __ ] handle that so this
[28:39] melanin thing was created to do this and this is why your friend is like yes i'm on my fourth booster and there's no debate about the efficacy at all you kidding no if you think there's a debate you're
[28:52] just a stupid head who writes books that have the word apocalypse in the title you must be stupid because you're tracking the great circle that every civilization that's ever been here before is written down
[29:05] right that's melanin that guy's not stupid that guy has more melanin than i do he secreted more melanin like let's not talk about how
[29:18] how government would run something like a pied piper but for eugenics which would literally bring around like a guillotine that's like safe and effective ding and people were to run out and go oh i want to try the government said it's cool and then they
[29:33] did it it's like wow that was totally safe and it was effective that dude's not here anymore it's exactly what the government wanted and it's safe and effective and no one had to force anybody
[29:46] nobody they're breeding out the melonites melaninites they're breeding them out they're finding the melaninites in the world and saying you know what you can't exist like this anymore
[30:00] it's time for the sun the yellow sun is white now you're not going to like it here so we're going to give you an exit to leave and you get to be a hero as you leave you get to be a hero and everyone's

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
30:13] going to wear a veil while you pass but now's your chance you got to do it now like now everyone's going to wear a veil forever all right you're going to only be able to have them aware of ale for a few years so if you want to participate in this great ceremony the
[30:27] the exodus melanonos now it's time and that's that's that's that's what i think is happening now light light is light i know i said light is source but it's just a little bit more complicated
[30:42] than that because source is source the wake of source in the ether is called light the light bearing photon i think photons are real you want
[30:56] to fight about it let's go let's go i think photons are real and i think that what they're carrying is not light but information but source that's why they're in packets because source could not be in a packet if it
[31:09] didn't have a relation to each other the information of that source is uh encoded and encrypted in in the uh the packets themselves these are uh light language you can
[31:22] look this up and you'll sell people show you uh sigils in the light language but those that information is encrypted and it's encrypted because it's compressed and your
[31:36] receptor check it out you have a free github version of unzip in your head in your source your pineal
[31:46] decrypts this it strikes your brain sand you literally have brain sand at your needle it strikes your brain sand and the vibration the perturbation of
[32:01] that is decrypted on the fly by you that decryption is going to be directly proportional to how comfortable you are this is the point of ellen noah did not have that
[32:16] he couldn't what he needed to do was far far too important [Music] we are talking about
[32:32] 100 pure albino source reality my friends oh yeah no melanin uncut unfiltered
[32:47] and this is this is horrible the people that are seeing this kind of world are we would call them giants we would we would call them giants wouldn't we we would and i mean giant in
[33:01] the uh uh derogatory way that it was meant biblically look at this giant over there tapping into that sweet albino source
[33:12] reality you know he's he's dangerous he's coming in here taking all our women lives 800 years geez man damn damn this dude so which ark is more
[33:27] plausible my friends which one which one the fisher price one where it's like yeah we need two now uh you meerkats uh you sure want use not a homosexual and one of the meerkats look at the other
[33:41] you sure now look i'm not here to judge you meerkats i'm not but you can't get on the ark if you're a homosexual well how is that not judging me
[33:54] how how in the world is that not judging me okay so you are homosexual no that is not to do it hypothetically how would that not be judge me it's like look i'm not judging you but you're gonna be asked to perform a
[34:07] certain duty when you're on the ark with uh the other meerkat and if you are not down with the uh down with the hoo-hoo we're gonna have a problem
[34:22] so i know this feels bad i know it feels like i'm i'm discriminating against you but but we can't we can't we don't have room for no gay meerkats we we need a we need a we need to we need you to be like the john holmes and mer we're
[34:37] looking for the the john holmes of merkatz here i don't know if that's his name john holmes we're looking for the porn star of uh oh god what is that guy's name oh god he looks like andre the giant with the rubber bands in his head ron jeremy we're looking for the ron jeremy of uh
[34:52] meerkats here you sure you got what it takes is that story more likely is that more plausible 2x2 or is it more plausible to read
[35:05] that scientists have been creating chimeras in the lab for decades and that the human monkey chimera is real i i want to remind you all that the fact that science is now telling you
[35:19] that they had to go to great lengths to make a human monkey chimera the very definition of chimera means two different species combined together okay i don't mind you thinking that you're a
[35:32] monkey i don't i don't but it just gives you so many excuses to be like oh anytime i touch myself it's evil and uh
[35:47] i have this ego that i have to strangle when no one's looking into john and oh i have to put off my life and harpoon it with several appointments throughout the day that only last from nine until five but which time there's an hour in
[36:01] between this precisely around the noon in which i will take a lunch because i will always be hungry then because that is my feeding time and it's not a rope it's a tie right that that those same kinds of people
[36:15] have been rewriting this history forever forever and just like the mythical city of troy we've been creating chimeras in the lab not for decades for eons
[36:31] for millennia right for that long that's how long we've been making chimeras and you you came from the ark of the chimera
[36:44] you did and you and you and you all of you did i remember i saw you there remember we were having to pee in the corner and we thought it was hilarious that we were peeing inside an ark when there's all this rain outside and we're like why
[36:58] can't we go outside but then noah gets all freaked out and that albino freak is already freaky enough but he's like no you can't you can't let the light out the luminous cloud is keeping us alive and if you let the light out it will die so be in the corner remember that
[37:12] yeah that was us and we came from this arc of chimera so let's not pretend that we're not the bastardized children
[37:26] of the giants this chimerism is very real it's very important it's very crucial and it's giving you gigantic clues you see that upon their gigantic gigantic clues
[37:41] about who and what we are grammarism isn't even unnatural in fact there's no way that we'd be able to survive have we not participated in these kinds of things they traced corn
[37:59] back to the genetic roots of corn back to the uh humble shores of honduras and the corn that they found was sort of like the bastard stepchild of
[38:16] of uh a wheat that had the uh strange propensity to place its fruit on the outside wasn't even wheat and they're able to look at the genetic code
[38:32] of that piece some of you don't believe in dna which is totally fine forgive me correct me in the comments please actually educate me prove my lips but they found the the genetic root of that and they saw how it became more and more complex and it led them down a path
[38:46] leading to maze what we see now and they notice that well wait a minute there's no way that you could make this many hops this many genetic changes in one
[38:58] cycle would take many many many cycles and it seems to suggest that it would require some serious ingenuity that someone would have to be paying a lot of attention to this
[39:12] particular corn in fact even preserving it because this is a 200 000 year old progress with numbers in the green the whole way
[39:26] the entire time and that that seems to suggest that that there's been some intention that's been placed even as long as 50 000 years ago that somebody was preserving and saving
[39:41] genetic corn and placing it in some sort of arc and you and i don't know what that arc would be because we are just learning we've just learned we've just learned
[39:54] how to make a monkey man we just learned that like last last week right we can now make a human monkey camaro that's great you still need your fourth booster though that these these things are budding
[40:08] sciences they're coming into life only now and only now are we able to look through the goggles of what we know or what we think we know to be completely satatic and to look back at our history and say holy [ __ ]
[40:22] they knew it too they knew it too and there's come here is crapping all over history there's chimera poop everywhere when you go back to these ancient sites and i i used to believe yeah it would be
[40:38] easy for a dude to like have a story of like hey you know it'd be cool if like a lion had boobies that'd be sweet man you know i'm a liar going i mean i'm you know the dude that plays a liar i'm a minstrel
[40:51] i'll say that i'm a minstrel a minstrel that's weird a minstrel like his wife is like a menstrual minced distress anyway i'm a minstrel i want to
[41:07] sing a song about a line with boobies i think everyone in the bar would love to hear a story about a lion with boobies and wings be great and sure i used to think that that's how these stories and and it could be
[41:21] it could be but it could be something else it could be something else that would point to the fact that we have two hundred thousand euro corn it would point to something else because there's a
[41:35] a giant plate off the coast of taiwan that is clearly a rock quarry it's about a mile underwater that there's there's beet sand found on the shelf
[41:50] of of what is possibly the city of of atlantis but that's two miles down that all these things are definitely suggesting that that there's a lot going on i you and i found find uh paleolithic
[42:04] seashells in ohio right and that you and i have just learned how to make monkey men chimeras in the lab and that you and i are living in a civilization that's probably going to be
[42:17] learning more in the future probably be learning a lot more and that this idea of chimeras isn't isn't necessarily outside our realm outside our wheelhouse these guys are pretty common they're so common that here's a dude
[42:38] writing a chimera saving the world from other chimera that's how common it was right pegasus you know we definitely have this idea of where it's like
[42:53] well so look some chimera are just fine and some chimera are awful okay and if you don't know that then you're going to hell it's kind of like the holy ghost demons up but not the holy ghost demons you all suck but but not you holy
[43:08] ghost no you're you're not an effervescent spirit that doesn't occupy a body but these efforts and spirits that don't occupy a body they're evil they're the demons but now you holy ghost you're different
[43:20] you're special right we have that that same same idea with chimeras and if you think about well if this idea because of the the gay meerkat
[43:37] because the little jeffy the gay meerkat who who's not the ron jeremy and meerkats what else how else could this arc function and you suddenly you look at that chimera and all of a sudden this light
[43:51] goes off ding ding ding this light goes off that wait a minute what about the nephilim here's a quick map from randall carlson
[44:04] showing you that every time we approach the cusp of leo like big [ __ ] happens there's like a massive reset and then it moves and if and you'll go through another six thousand years and if you're lucky
[44:18] if you're lucky the age of taurus won't get you but it probably will and then when you head into the cusp of aquarius it's going to happen again and it's going to happen again at scorpio now scorpio is the eagle
[44:33] if you take that as now look at what we just did the great sky clock doesn't just have the time it has an alarm it's showing you that whenever it enters the house of leo whenever it enters the house of taurus whenever it enters the
[44:47] house of aquarius whenever it enters the house of eagle all of these are the chimera the four corners we've talked about this figure a lot right la mas i think it's called llamas
[44:59] or lumok or something uh in sumerian all right the eagle lion remember the notre dame's episodes we did pretty sweet right remember those same dudes right on the four remember gold line missing remember the cherub
[45:14] uh story of enoch right encoded into the mythology is the actual information that there's an alarm that goes off every six thousand years uh some of you are going to want to secrete some melanin for what i'm about
[45:32] to say but right now we've just entered the age of aquarius and we're we're watching uh something big happen right now right were you writing a book with the word
[45:49] apocalypse in it god this is stupid why would anyone write a book about apocalypse when there's like 250 million years of history backing you know oh you're so dumb for writing a book you wrote five of them god you're like
[46:03] five times dumb so you'd have to create this genetic arc wouldn't you you'd need an embryonic dispensary right and the sole goal of that uh embryonic dispensary was to populate the earth
[46:17] you'd be creating a carnal vol of giants and literally this is the archetype of the of the baphomet i don't i don't write these things i report them you know that
[46:31] i did no work i required no glue for me to take the head of the bathmet off and stick it on top of noah no work was required at all you know what that [ __ ] was magnetic it doused its way together it doused its way together
[46:47] that this is a lamb of god that's who that is these are lambs of god and we we we know this we did a huge episode of of it
[47:00] just uh just a week or two ago right and here's the ba fomet secreting the male and the female secreting all of creation on the placenta of the nile here's the baphomet the dhaksa and hindu
[47:18] same same idea morphed into a man but still wearing the headdress in egypt same thing check out my other episode if you want more on that there's a lot on that and we covered this last time too
[47:32] that there's something about the sheep that's very very prolific when it comes to xenotransplantation multiplets chimerism modeling humans and enhancing humanity itself right
[47:46] leading to the advancement of humans itself it turns out that lamb are a great way of doing that my friends giants were the lambs of god and they were considered hideous they were considered terrifying they
[48:01] were considered horrible because that was their job their job was to [ __ ] their job was to give birth their job was to live for hundreds of years identical twins
[48:18] multiplets and chimeras um what is this james yes sheep embryo that the basic techniques for sheep embryo led to the ability of actually creating
[48:32] identical twins multiplets and chime areas without actually needing that much work and the lambs had this built in our sheep had this built-in ability to have their inbuilt split
[48:45] it was an economic shortcut kind of like how maize is already there an edible kind of corn and imagine this arc of chimera spitting out all kinds of horrible things
[48:59] all kinds of things in its desperate quest to populate the earth does it want to do it neatly or does it want to do it quickly why would it need to do it quickly james because there's a timeline dummy right i should have said silly there's a
[49:15] timeline silly there's a timeline we cannot afford to do this without applying some calories we've got a window here people and if we want to
[49:30] grow a fresh crop of humans we may only have six thousand years if we're lucky we might have twelve thousand clock is ticking clock is ticking
[49:44] so what do you do you unleash the lamb of god on the land and it probably was hideous it probably was scary it probably was terrifying it probably was
[49:58] um exactly as they described it did you know that the older a woman gets the more likely it is that she will have twins not only twins but she might have
[50:13] triplets she might have quadruplets known this for quite some time that women are more likely to conceive fraternal twins once they reach in their 30s this is uh they claim because of an evolutionary response to combat declining embryo viability
[50:28] but what if it was something else my friends that what if twins having twins having twins having twins having twins having twins having twins would be prolific
[50:44] and you know what would make it even more prolific because of this fact that uh they're more likely to have twins what if we made the women not just die at 60 but they lived till 700.
[51:00] that these giants these 700 year old women were spitting out quintuplets after quintuplets after quintuplets walking through the fields just plop plop plop like pumpkins
[51:14] falling in the dew right and that's exactly what you would need if you were spawning the earth with the lamb of god and the entire time while you're spawning the earth the entire time adam is telling his
[51:30] children in the book of adam and eve he's telling them hey guys you guys you're going to go out you're going to have a good time you're going to [ __ ] you're going to proliferate you're going to carnal you're going to have a carnal vaul and then
[51:42] a lot of you going to die you're going to die because you're not right and the reason why you're not right is because you're not supposed to be right you're supposed to be here to do the carnal spreading it's your job
[51:56] and we can't have you wandering around for 700 years dude you don't need to be here that long you don't and so you will be fallen genetically that every time you have a child that child
[52:10] will genetically be limited just like dolly the sheep dolly lived half her age as a artificial uh sheep
[52:22] a gmo sheep lived half as long and the nephilim had the same thing see last episode for a lot more information about what i just said but this twinning is fascinating to me this nephilim twins did you know that in
[52:39] sparta their first rulers were twins and that that country had a uh tradition of only allowing twins to be their leaders and if you think about this carnal
[52:55] spirit that having twins would be a benefit that it would be easier to spread the seed to unblock noah's ark through twins and so we have this competing ideas don't we on one side
[53:10] we're like oh twins are so great they're like in charge and they found it alls they're oceanis they're the titans right all this mythological history of twins everywhere they founded rome everything
[53:24] and then on the saint in the same token we're calling them the devil itself the fallen ones the horrible horrible the word for horrible ones was giant giants
[53:39] and that they were made to fall because they were here to plow the fields he plowed the fields he just said flower the fields yeah exactly it's exactly what i meant
[53:52] they were here to plow the fields um i want to remind you all the cervical rib in the humans uh was a key innovation in the success for gigantism and the
[54:06] eight percent of uh larger part of the vertebral column is reinforced by having this cervical uh rib and that many verb vertebrates including reptiles uh is a normal part of their anatomy to
[54:20] have this extra rib and these are the same things that had larger heads that had larger bodies a body that could live 700 years a body that could live a thousand years and then as i showed you last time in that timeline
[54:33] consistently degradating every generation every generation is degrading now imagine what that felt like to know wow i'm not even gonna outlive my father damn
[54:46] and my kids they're not gonna outlive me of course you'd feel like a fallen one of course you'd feel that way and you know what it would make you want to have carnal sex more maybe
[55:00] maybe maybe not who knows right the protoplast finding the protoblast is difficult in nature because there's only one protoplast this protoplast is this uh idea of the first formed
[55:16] adam and eve right noah would you consider him a protoplast adam kamon lilith right the origin species all of these origins
[55:30] have this twinning notion this first first notion and the same twins are found on uh in native american lore this uh figures on the right here and that you
[55:43] have the same chimera built into so many of these totems the khmer is everywhere my friends this is from our last episode not the last but an earlier episode but the idea
[55:55] of aedum adam the sun and moon united the symbol of the baphomet itself the sacred hermaphrodite that these symbols are are uh truly responsible for um
[56:11] uh the splitting of adam and eve and that the hermaphrodite is a real thing it's not a construct we know that the chimerism proves that even
[56:25] but isn't it interesting though that we always have to split this atom that the atom cadmon is the hidden atom the potential atom the atom cassia is the uh hidden atom once it's split from the
[56:40] potential of the kadman the i should have actually anyway uh so the uh atom cassia and the hawa cassia that's the atom in the eve split from the edom
[56:53] but you still have this atom pagria the bodily atom and then there's these all these stories about wait a minute so there's eve but then there's lilith too and do you want to know who lilith is
[57:07] lilith is the split of eve that's why adam had two wives but only one right that's why there are two atoms what do you mean there's two atoms there's two atoms
[57:20] the atom cascia the atom pocaria this isn't the only place there's two atoms i'm just getting warmed up ladies and gentlemen we're just getting warmed up the curse of canaan what is commonly known as the curse of ham was not bestowed upon himself rather
[57:37] noah indirectly cursed him via his son kanan right janus exactly yeah you'll see that too and chim and jet path took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backwards and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were
[57:52] backward and they saw not their father's nakedness one of the weirdest voices of verses in the world genesis 9 12 actually there's 9 23 sorry
[58:08] the talmud deduces two possible explanations one attributed rabbi abba arika and one to rabbi samuel for what ham did to noah to warrant the curse erika says him castrated noah and links it up to the fourth son of
[58:23] canaan that's his idea samuel says no he's sodomized noah referring to how many times the word and he saw him uh as as being a sign of of having sex and samuel says well he

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
58:38] had to sodomize noah because noah's a dude that's what samuels told you sam said well it had to be sodomy because he was a dude and i'm telling you these are giants
[58:51] and that noah is not a normal creature so not normal that lamech is about to uh divorce his wife and that the reason why noah is not normal is because noah is chosen
[59:05] and that he's probably not just an albino he's probably a hermaphrodite he's probably this ark that lives longer than ham and shem combined
[59:20] and they find that to be fallen they feel as if they are unworthy and ham goes in to noah who's drunk from the wine in his fields
[59:34] and does something to him and what's interesting is that the scripture doesn't say that ham goes into his tent it actually refers
[59:53] to it as her tent and then in genesis 9 21 noah is called her tent and he drank of the wine and was drunken
[01:00:05] and he was uncovered within her tent not his tent we did an episode where we covered a lot of this this is not just an anomaly i just need you to go back if you think
[01:00:19] that that i'm nitpicking here did took a lot of time to do this work here's 21 examples i think back up what i mean and then this is not even just my idea a lot of people talk i don't know i'm the dude
[01:00:32] that's telling you it's like a baphomet i'll i'll admit that but this concept of his tent versus hurting is not a uh it's not a james true idea [ __ ] i don't think i showed you that here's all those 21 verses to back it up james watch this
[01:00:47] screen not that screen this screen not that screen so the hermaphrodite is castrated i i want you just to think about that castration could mean a lot of things to eliminate someone's ability to
[01:01:07] reproduce might fit with the word castrate especially if you are calling a hermaphrodite a he that that might be something you do what
[01:01:19] did him do i don't know option one he castrated his his uh male organ that that's definitely an option i don't think that's it i think he had sex with noah and i don't
[01:01:35] think he sodomized him i think he stuck it right in the ganesh right where the right where you'd feed the elephant a carrot i think that's where uh ham uh came by to say hi
[01:01:54] and i think he did that because he uh knew that his his children would not be of that same kind that his children would be fallen
[01:02:08] and that the only way he could produce a son that would outlast his other brothers is if he was to take advantage of noah while he was drunk in her tent and to go inside
[01:02:23] and this is why everyone reacted so horribly they were like dude did you just ganesh dad and it's like yeah i did
[01:02:38] i did and one of the reasons why his brothers could not look at noah is because they could see the ganesh of noah
[01:02:51] in its totality that this is part of that fallen spirit it's a genetic curse there's uh this argument i'm sorry i'm not sure how to
[01:03:23] even word this but there's this idea that noah has a fourth son and i think this proves like without a doubt what i just told you because sometimes the bible treats
[01:03:40] canaan as if it's noah's son and sometimes the bible treats kanan as if it's ham's son and if you take the story where ham goes
[01:03:53] into noah and drops his seed inside noah's ganesh that now you have a case where kanan is both noah's son and ham's son
[01:04:08] i don't i don't mean to toot my own horn but what i just told you i don't think anyone has ever thought of that before i know that sounds really arrogant but i just for what it's worth
[01:04:24] this show has cool stuff in it and and sometimes you don't know it's cool because maybe you don't know what's been said and what hasn't been said i probably shouldn't have said that but i just if i had like an applause sign
[01:04:39] i would like flash it just then because the fact that there's this confusion over well whose son is kanan is it noah's for son or is it hamsun it's just
[01:04:52] completely completely answered in this idea i'm not saying it makes it true but man it's it's [ __ ] fire i'm telling you it's it's really really profound god that sounds arrogant james shut up
[01:05:07] this fourth sun kept uh it really took off this unnamed fourth son uh they claimed refused to come aboard the ark and instead climbed a mountain and was drowned by himself
[01:05:20] that this fourth sun uh is uh has a lot more prolific history in the koran why because the people in the koran weren't trying to uh
[01:05:34] clean the stuff up so much the sacredness of the text is more important now there's there's arguments inside the p translation which is beautifully even explains that and it backs up what i'm saying that
[01:05:47] those discrepancies the peace source had to say what he said about there's a paragraph that says uh ham whose son was canaan that one of the few times the peace
[01:06:02] source added whose son was kanan typically the p source would never add anything like that even if it conflicted the p source just wanted as much of the original text just to be there and so the p stores did what he could to satisfy the conflictedness by putting
[01:06:17] the comma because his son kanan when in fact the original text was correct that kanan was the son of ham and noah and that ham was fighting against the
[01:06:29] very nephilitic falling that was happening to his chimeric line the whole time it was a desperate clinging to the gonads of your father saying hey
[01:06:43] you're drunk let's make some babies weird right there's an irish myth that noah had another son named biff biff and uh again he wouldn't come aboard the
[01:07:00] ark so he tries to colonize and apparently is uh wiped out in the deluge wiped out in the darkness would be a way of looking at that and that they try and trace this same
[01:07:11] dude to the house of wessex now which uh if you look at this hermaphroditic theme inside the elite i think it ties all the way back to here
[01:07:27] all the way back to here and that kanan kanan would be the child of of noah not him and that's a there could be a genetic reason why
[01:07:43] a certain group of people kept this hermaphroditic trait longer than others uh biff b-i-t-h not biff i know i said it that way but i don't know how to say it biff it should be on the screen there
[01:07:57] it's underlying the fourth son actually in one story demands the shin bones because he's not going to the ark in this text they called him yantan yantan demands part of the relics of
[01:08:11] adam which were kept in the ark and uh noah said okay fine you're not coming on the ark for whatever reason but here's the adam's shin bone there's this these are giants and they're terrible
[01:08:26] and at the same time we venerate them and we need their bones and this whole fetish we have for relics most of the time actually encapsulated inside the pulpit itself
[01:08:40] the shin bones of adam because we knew it was the last remnants we had of living 800 900 a thousand years old this is the last chances we had at
[01:08:53] being that and doing those things right lamech noah's dad uh was 182 180 years old at the birth of noah
[01:09:07] and live for another 595 years contained until the year 777 five years before the darkness or the flood according to one legend preserved in the babylonian talmud god cursed him because he broke a prohibition on sex aboard the
[01:09:24] ark and was smitten in his skin according to another noah cursed him because he castrated his father what i want you to see here look read between the lines
[01:09:37] pam broke a prohibition on sex aboard the ark that before the ark was built the story is told that noah was overcome with impotence
[01:09:51] that for a hundred years or i think it was 100 noah had no interest in sex at all because he was supposed to focus on the ark focus on the ark and that that would be the closest way you could interpret the idea that
[01:10:05] before noah there was a time when sex was not how you procreated and that when you entered into the ark the children that would come forth from the ron jeremy murcats and everyone else around would bequeath those that would
[01:10:18] have to have sex in order to procreate it was breaking the prohibition on sex is the same way as saying you now need sex to survive that that is what
[01:10:32] is required of you now in order for us to get more clues about all this we need to understand that noah is the son of prometheus did you guys know that that noah i didn't actually know uh know
[01:10:50] that uh dusa ducelyon uh do do callion is it ducalian it is isn't it ducalian uh was the son of prometheus but new callion was noah
[01:11:04] so if the son of prometheus is noah that means lamech is noah means that prometheus is the grandson of enoch pretty cool right
[01:11:19] and you'd only know this if you jumped over into greek the only way you'd know this but there it is that do galleon i think that's how you pronounce it that ducallion
[01:11:33] built the same arc did the same thing it was a chess by the way so couldn't see out and he was the son of prometheus right so lamecha's prometheus noah
[01:11:49] is dusalon this uh starts to open the story up more because the story of prometheus stealing fire becomes something much more [Music] much more the chimeria prometheus split into
[01:12:09] epimetheus that it is known that epimedia epimetheus which is the brother of prometheus remember the twins remember the twins okay epimetheus the brother of prometheus
[01:12:23] is called by many to be the first man and the pandora is referred to as the first woman and that pandora epimetheus if you remember was tempted by pandora this is your adam
[01:12:38] and eve but before adam and eve aedum had to split and the splitting of aedem was prometheus and epimetheus
[01:12:52] prometheus the word means forethought epimetheus the word means after thought you're looking at the first janus and in these stories prometheus is called the maker of man and in these stories epimetheus is
[01:13:07] called the maker of animal epimetheus ran out and made all the animals first and he gave away all the gifts of swiftness cunningness camouflage and when prometheus had made had made
[01:13:21] man he had no fur to give him he had no feathers to give him he had no speed he had no hooves and so prometheus feeling bad gave him fire
[01:13:36] he gave man fire fire is immortality it's immortality epimetheus fell through his temptation for who pandora epimetheus
[01:13:52] and pandora are the adam and eve that you knew before this stream prometheus is the aedum the combination of forethought and afterthought the promethean model of what we think is really the combination
[01:14:06] of the twins prometheus and epinepheus the chimera of those two as one before the split from bones to stones noah
[01:14:21] remember deuce alien do salient i hate that i'm pronouncing it wrong whatever it is just laugh and correct me just do that i'll i'll stop getting my ego heard about it uh bones of their mother must be cast behind them
[01:14:37] what's interesting about this creation story is is that it is the story of adam but there's something really really important i think it's on the next slide prometheus stole fire back from zeus further enraged zeus sent the first
[01:14:54] woman to live with humanity sorry this is uh here it is here comes the slide okay sorry guys uh do callion uh had to make man and the story goes that he threw stones
[01:15:11] over shoulder and that the stones were the bones of their mother and by throwing them over their shoulder you reproduce now eve is the pandora and she was made out of clay by
[01:15:25] one of the titans we talked about him a few weeks ago ephesus made pandora and from her a race of female kind he literally made what is the box
[01:15:40] of pandora that beautiful box you guys know what that box is we spend our lives looking for that box and that's the the protoplast aviv pandora
[01:15:54] the the uh vessel for the end for the prohibition for the end of prohibition of sex is that box noah
[01:16:07] split into two by the children of prometheus you can read this and and i think see more once the deluge was over and the couple of given things to zeus noah said in several the sources to have been age 82 at this time consulted an oracle of
[01:16:24] themis about how to repopulate the earth this is another ding ding ding new point new point here comes a new point that's that we haven't found yet feel free to correct it if you think it's wrong and he was told to cover your head and
[01:16:38] throw the bones of your mother behind your shoulder and uh understood that mother is gaia the mother of all things and the bones to be rocks or clay they threw the rocks behind their shoulders forming people but check it out noah's wife
[01:16:55] [Music] brah when she threw the bones of the rocks over her shoulder they became women when dusalan
[01:17:08] did the same they became men and who did they consult but themis the oracle of themis and the oracle of themis is the symbol of justice that you see today it is the
[01:17:21] uh the balance of the scales but my friends those scales those scales are sex this is the male and the female and the justice the splitting of the
[01:17:36] male and the female is literally prometheus becoming themis and that's why justice comes from the goddess of law femus it is the splitting of the male and the female the exact
[01:17:50] same thing that happened here epimetheus afterthought prometheus forethought noah why would noah need to consult the
[01:18:08] goddess of law about how to spread bones because this isn't the goddess of law this is that splitting the cleavage the mitosis
[01:18:23] of your genesis the taking away of immortality and prometheus stealing that mortality and giving stealing that immortality and giving it to you
[01:18:38] how did he give it to you he hid it inside the genetic code of a fennel stock prometheus stole fire back from zeus in a fennel stock and restored it to humanity this further enraged zeus who sent the
[01:18:51] first woman to live with humanity the woman a shy maiden pandora was fashioned out of clay and athena helped to adorn her properly from her the race of women and female kind of her is the deadly race hear that deadly race meaning mortal race and
[01:19:07] tribe of women who live amongst men to their greater trouble the man now must soil and toil to find woman in order for him to have his fire of immortality he needs the woman is
[01:19:21] what this is saying and it proves it even more because for his crimes prometheus was punished by zeus who bound him with chains and sent an eagle to eat prometheus as immortal liver
[01:19:34] every day which then grew back every night zeus was attacking prometheus's immortality wasn't he it was punishing him for his immortality the light that prometheus
[01:19:51] brought you is this hermaphroditic sorry immortality the fennel plant produces a hermaphrodite flower with both male and female parts fennel is known for its invasive nature as it will reproduce
[01:20:05] from both group crown and seed fennel is a one of the richest sources of dlk1 which is one of the key genes involved
[01:20:24] in the development of what the liver and the same dlk1 has been used in genetic testing because it's giving huge implications for the importance of sheet production
[01:20:37] that when we give sheep fennel we have a better ability to produce twins to produce multiplets mult multiplets
[01:20:51] and chimera that fennel not making this up that fennel encourages chimerism encourages the proliferation of your liver the very thing that is attacked
[01:21:05] and you know what's just freaking fat whoa what did i just do oh [ __ ] did i just close the stream you guys there and what is uh you guys are there and uh and what is cool about the liver
[01:21:20] the liver has a unique capacity among organs to generate itself a liver can grow to a normal size even after up to 90 percent of it has been removed but the liver isn't invincible many diseases this is pandora and exposures
[01:21:34] can still harm it now so zeus inserted pandora to stop the liver even when it's able to reproduce itself the liver is the only organ that can do that there's your immortality right there my
[01:21:48] friends the liver now you tell me when stan and cletus were writing the old stories because they're mythologers right when they're writing the old stories do you think that they were seriously
[01:22:02] yeah what's a good uh thing what's the good archetype for like immortalities like you know think fennel that sounds right and uh liver it's like how do you know that it's like i'm just making them up i spun my wheel of organs and it landed on liver
[01:22:16] these are ancient ways the ark of chimaera is an ancient memory inside your bones it's there it's there stories of enoch
[01:22:31] called the sappheraba considered the great scribe or great male if you remember we talked about hebrew the who he and the meaning of male that male itself means to remember that the hebrew letter for male means to
[01:22:44] remember and that enoch was considered the great scribe and god took him and brought enoch back into the enclosed garden why because he was the great scribe what am i saying to you enoch was a master key
[01:23:01] the keys of enoch his body his genetic code was used as a master the master copy and his grandson prometheus inherited that code
[01:23:17] inherited it enoch was brought into the city of god where he was surrounded by cherubim chimera everywhere right wheels within wheels
[01:23:29] with the head of a lion with the head of a of an eagle with the head of a bull and with the head of man surrounded by chimeras going ah
