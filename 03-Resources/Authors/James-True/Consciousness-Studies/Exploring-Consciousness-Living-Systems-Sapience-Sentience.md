## Chapter 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview of Living Systems and Consciousness

Living systems represent a fascinating intersection of complexity, dynamics, and information processing, underpinning the very essence of consciousness. To embark on this exploration, it's imperative to establish a clear understanding of what constitutes living systems and the attributes they embody.

#### Defining Living Systems

Living systems, in their essence, encompass entities characterized by dynamic information processing and energy consumption. These systems exhibit properties of consciousness, intelligence, sapience, and sentience, marking them as distinct from non-living entities. Central to their definition is the intricate interplay between structure and function, manifesting in adaptive responses to environmental stimuli.

#### Attributes of Consciousness, Intelligence, Sapience, and Sentience

Within the realm of living systems, consciousness emerges as a multifaceted phenomenon, encompassing the capacity for self-awareness, perception, cognition, and subjective experience. Intelligence, closely intertwined with consciousness, reflects the ability to acquire and apply knowledge, solve problems, and exhibit adaptive behavior.

While intelligence has been extensively studied, the concepts of sapience and sentience offer intriguing avenues for exploration. Sapience denotes a deeper level of wisdom and insight, transcending mere intellect to encompass profound understanding and discernment. On the other hand, sentience pertains to the capacity for experiencing sensations, emotions, and subjective states, akin to the realm of feeling and awareness.

### 1.2. Importance of Understanding Sapience and Sentience

Amidst the comprehensive scrutiny afforded to intelligence, the attributes of sapience and sentience have often lingered in the shadows, awaiting deeper investigation. Yet, their significance cannot be overstated, as they hold profound implications for our understanding of consciousness and the nature of existence.

#### Significance of Sapience in Previous Studies

Throughout scholarly discourse, sapience has garnered attention for its role in shaping human civilization, fostering wisdom, ethical reasoning, and moral deliberation. From ancient philosophical inquiries to contemporary debates on artificial intelligence ethics, the quest for sapience has been synonymous with the pursuit of enlightenment and transcendence.

#### Rarity of Studies on Sentience

In contrast to the well-trodden paths of sapience inquiry, studies on sentience have remained relatively scarce, veiled in mystery and philosophical abstraction. Despite its intrinsic relevance to lived experience and subjective reality, the exploration of sentience has been characterized by ambiguity and conceptual ambiguity.

#### Need for Exploring the Nature of Sentience

As we navigate the intricacies of consciousness, it becomes evident that an in-depth understanding of sentience is indispensable. Sentience, with its capacity for emotional experience and subjective perception, offers a unique window into the essence of being. By unraveling the mysteries of sentience, we unlock profound insights into the fabric of reality and the nature of existence itself.
