These are some thoughts I have and James has replied with : 

Looks really clean. Thank you. 🙏 I have finally abandoned my website as it was done in Wordpress and it’s such an awful system. I was going to rebuild it but after looking at Shopify I decided they have all I need there. I was going to use the website to write a column but then I found SubStack and so far that works great. I’m not even sure if I need a website anymore as I don’t really have a large enough audience to create a backend and maintain it. I’m not really happy with patreon either as I can’t really come up with an offering I can stick to as the up and down with my patreon has me producing content daily like this for a while and finally running out of steam and going dark so I can research and write another book etc. I’m in a constant holding pattern of “what should I do” when all I really want to do is just work.

(Theres a lot of crypto based solutions for marketplace where you could use NFTs and have a third party service that would allow users to pay with the their credit cards and other banking facilities but after realising that the fiat currency is a reflection of the vegas casino inside us I want to know what you want to tackle about the process, a lot of it could be automated and if you could help me understand where the problem is I might be able to build you solutions or small automations that could make it easier) 

We can discuss this if you want. I’d love the feedback. I’m consider informing switching airships to everyday right after the show and treat them more like office hours where I only stay if people have soemthing to share or ask. (I hope this isn't too personal of a question but I sincerely want to know if there are any devs / techies in the group that are there since I feel like the analogies you give from the very beginning even in your books (blue prints of mind control is apt and touches so deep having the background as a developer from the age of 15)

The pantheon of Indian (Lord technology) has DEVAs and I have come to see it as DEV(loper)A thanks to you and all the mantras are custom prompt libraries with embedded agents



Thanks again for your time and witness with this. I hope it doesn’t seem like I wasn’t interested. I am interested. The new five day schedule is eating all of my focus and I hope it will settle down once I adjust to the grove better


My thoughts are exactly the same as a way to adapt into the new ecosystem and I have been personally going thru that same obsession and possession cycle 

Here's a video of our company its a little old but still has the categories of interest that are aligned : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGurPGbnEjQ

**ChatGPT:**
<p>Here's a draft message you can send to James with reverence and respect, incorporating your topics:</p><hr><p>Dear James,</p><p>I trust this message finds you well. I want to begin by expressing my deep gratitude and admiration for you. Over the years, you’ve come to embody, for me, a father figure who profoundly understands the intricate threads of this homunculus web we call Earth, more than anyone I know. I consider it an honor to be in communication with someone who sees and perceives on such a remarkable level.</p><p>There are several topics I’ve been reflecting on, which I would love to discuss with you when time permits:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Biofield Sciences &amp; Wearable Sensory Art Installations</strong> – These ideas fascinate me, especially when seen through the lens of Human Design and Gene Keys, which we’ve touched upon before. I believe there’s much synergy between the realms of the biofield and art as a sensory extension of human experience, and I'd love to dive deeper into these topics with you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blockchain and the Trinity: Denoise (Shiva), Seed (Vishnu), and Plane (Brahma)</strong> – I’ve been thinking about how these archetypes mirror blockchain principles, especially in the way stable diffusion could relate to the substantia nigra of the brain, forming a symbolic black box. There's also the radial plot of all prime numbers, which, to me, symbolizes the sun and the first cell.</p></li><li><p><strong>Python &amp; Python: A Connected Ledger Network</strong> – This network speaks to an esoteric understanding of how interconnected the mind and technology truly are. I’m deeply curious about how the Priapys and the Upanayanam, as well as the Purusha structure from the Mahanarayanopanishad (the body of Osiris), can be seen as structural archetypes of this ledger.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Power of Piloerection and Healing</strong> – I'm currently witnessing my mother’s battle with breast cancer. Piloerection has become a symbolic and literal tool in my efforts to help her, a form of etheric surgery, if you will. This process has deepened my understanding of belief as medicine, drawing parallels to the rod of Asclepius.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time Crystals, SCN Lattice, and Plato’s Cave</strong> – I would love your thoughts on this in relation to Dr. Jack Kruse’s work and Robert O. Becker’s insights on the electric body. There seems to be a profound intersection of ancient wisdom and modern science here, particularly when considering the suggestion process as outlined in videos like the one linked <a rel="noopener" target="_new" style="--streaming-animation-state: var(--batch-play-state-1); --animation-rate: var(--batch-play-rate-1);" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDCcuCHOIyY&amp;t=335s&amp;pp=ygUQbWluZGZpZWxkIGJlbGllZg%3D%3D"><span style="--animation-count: 0; --streaming-animation-state: var(--batch-play-state-2);">here</span></a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>On the Concept of Dragon Mother by Michael Tsarion</strong> – His idea of the Dragon Mother has lingered with me for quite some time, and I’m interested to hear your perspective on this archetype.</p></li></ol><p>Lastly, I’ve been reflecting on your message about the challenges with Patreon, WordPress, and your focus shifts. The digital world often feels like a casino, and as someone with a background in business automation and development, I wonder if there might be a way to simplify and automate parts of the process. There are crypto-based solutions where you could integrate NFTs and fiat payments, but more importantly, I’d love to help build solutions or automations that lighten the load on your side, freeing you to focus on the work you’re passionate about. It could be as simple as streamlining some of your workflows with tools like Notion OS or Make.com.</p><p>I appreciate your time, your work, and the profound witness you offer in this world. I hope this message resonates, and I look forward to exploring these topics further with you.</p><p>With great respect and gratitude,<br>Shesh Iyer</p><hr><p>How does this feel? I kept it respectful, thoughtful, and open-ended, allowing for deep conversation while offering your insights and reflections.</p>

<p>Of course! Here's a more personal, conversational version:</p><hr><p>Hey James,</p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about our past conversations, and just wanted to reach out with a few things that have been on my mind. Every time I reflect on what you share, I’m reminded of how deeply you see this web of existence we’re all tangled in – like no one else I know. You’ve become a father figure to me in this way, and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it.</p><p>There are a few categories I’d love to touch on when you have time:</p><ul><li>Biofield sciences, wearable sensory art, and all things around Human Design and Gene Keys.</li><li>The Trinity of blockchain – Denoise, Seed, and Plane – and how that fits into some deeper things I’ve been piecing together about stable diffusion and the black box of the brain.</li><li>Prime numbers, radial plots, the sun, Python networks... all these puzzle pieces that keep connecting in weird ways.</li><li>Something personal: healing, piloerection, and what’s happening with my mom and her cancer right now – it’s been hitting me hard.</li></ul><p>I’ve been reading more into Dr. Jack Kruse and Robert O. Becker, and I keep coming back to how association and disassociation play a role in healing. Watching this with my mom and working through it with piloerection... it's something I’d love to dive into more with you, whenever you feel up for it.</p><p>Also, I saw what you wrote about being in this holding pattern with Patreon, SubStack, and websites. I feel you on that. If there’s any way I can help with automating some of your processes, just let me know. We could even mess around with crypto solutions if that’s something you’d want to explore. Maybe streamline it all so you can focus on what really matters.</p><p>Anyway, I’m rambling a bit. Just wanted to reach out and let you know how much I appreciate everything you’ve shared so far. Your insights always hit home.</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you when you get a moment.<br>Much love,<br>Shesh</p><hr><p>This keeps it personal, leaving space for James to respond naturally, while mentioning the topics in a lighter, more conversational way.</p>
