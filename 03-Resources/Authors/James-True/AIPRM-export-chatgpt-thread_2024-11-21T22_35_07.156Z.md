[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] hello i'm jordan maxwell the video you're about to watch is composed of three separate half an hour interviews that were conducted not too long ago the lady that will be interviewing me is rita dyson
[00:14] the man is ralph walker uh the response to these three half-hour interviews when they first aired was so favorable that we felt that we wanted to put them together into one program and
[00:28] we hope that you will enjoy them and of course we would be very happy to hear from you if you'd like to have some further you know further information i want to thank you for your time
[00:42] [Music]
[01:06] of all the tyrannies that affect mankind tyranny and religion is the worst every other species of tyranny is limited to the world we live in a religion attempts to strive beyond the
[01:22] grave and seeks to pursue us into eternity thomas payne jordan you you've got to tell me about yourself um well rita first of all let me thank you
[01:36] for inviting me back and i enjoy being here with you uh as i told you before and privately the way i involve myself in this is it comes by me naturally because when my mother when i was growing up with a little kid
[01:49] my mother had an uncle who worked in the vatican secretary of state's office and about every three or four years he'd come back to the country to visit the family and as a little kid i would sit and listen to this uh this
[02:02] brilliant uh gentleman talking about international intrigue politics of the highest levels and he was quite knowledgeable working in the vatican secretary of state's office and the things he would talk
[02:15] about the secret societies the the money that was made throughout the world internationally the politics and generally the entire world scheme of things how politics and religion work
[02:29] together behind the scenes so i grew up hearing this kind of conversation and my grandfather was a senator my great-grandfather was a congressman i have two living uncles today who are federal judges
[02:42] so i grew up around hearing this type of conversation in the family about intriguing politics and the behind the scenes stuff going on in world religion
[02:55] at the ripe old age of 17 i decided that i wanted to find out if there was a bottom to this issue and i began my research and study into theology and all of the uh
[03:08] arcane or occult theologies of the world i was fascinated by some of the most powerful movements in the world and i have come to the conclusion that there has never been on
[03:22] this earth a political movement that wasn't a little religious and there's never been a religious movement in the history of the world that wasn't a little political but the problem you run into with theology and when you get into religion
[03:37] and theology is that there are two kinds of facts that we have in theology the kind you look up and the kind you make up and so much of what we have been uh told
[03:50] uh and be left to believe is true in theology and religion especially in the western world is nothing more in my opinion than political propaganda and i think this can be proven but over
[04:03] and above the political aspect of western religion i am also fascinated as this book brings out it's just a general anthology on religion just generally things which most people don't know
[04:16] about theology and religion that the church would rather you not know for instance we get into i get into in particular the uh the connection between astro theology which is the world's oldest religion
[04:31] you can go back to five to seven thousand years before christ and the worship of the heavens what dominated the ancient world i as i said i don't believe that there are too many
[04:44] people today in the western civilization who have really looked at where religion came from where our ideas and concept have come from now we don't mind we are all aware
[04:57] of how other people can be wrong and what they believe because other people we have a theology and other people have a mythology other people are wrong because they don't have they don't share your
[05:11] concepts and your belief and that's because they don't understand they're wrong but they don't understand i am saying that we can all be wrong there's not one human creature on the earth that that is so well informed that
[05:24] they cannot possibly be wrong on something all i'm asking my audience to do is to look at the facts of where western religion has come from and look at behind the scenes
[05:37] uh the connections between government and religion let me give you an example okay but even all right well let me give you a quick example of just the point i made between uh tying government in with religion when you go into most churches
[05:50] today you will see the altar is three tiers high it's three degrees high it has in most churches they will have a a fence with the gate and only the priest can go through the gate or through the fence
[06:04] up until the altar when the priest uh the clergy comes out he's dressed in a long robe everyone stands out of respect it's the same thing in any courtroom you have the people of the of the of the congregation
[06:18] out here you have the fence with the gate and only the attorneys can go through and speak for you and the bench is three tiers high the three tiers high in the church and courtroom stand for the first three
[06:31] degrees of freemasonry the when the when the uh when the judge comes out he's dressed in the long black robe just as the priest is dressed in a long black robe just as you will be dressed in a long
[06:43] robe when you graduate from university or college the connections are continual the the judge can sit and look down on you for he represents the law spell l-a-w
[06:57] you need to look at where the word law comes from and then of course the the priest can look down on the audience and the people in the church he represents god which is the law so you're saying that
[07:10] people should start looking at in things with a more with a different eye yes than what they in other words people just take it for granted this has always been and this is the way it is absolutely but there is there is an origin
[07:28] for every one of these things gerald massey one of the greatest egyptologists that ever lived wrote that they will find it difficult those who have accepted the authority as truth
[07:41] rather than the truth as authority and so i'm saying that that's what's happened to us as a civilization in the west i'm not interested that much in the east tonight uh i'm more interested in our western
[07:55] way of life and the religion the philosophies that guide our lives the mere fact that in this country in america when you run afoul of the law they say you have broke the law
[08:08] just as moses broke the law and of course the sheriff has a six-pointed badge as the star the star of david or the six-pointed hexagram uh all of our judicial proceedings in
[08:21] court are based on the old common uh common law of england or britannia and incidentally britain is britain or british and brit in hebrew is a contract or a
[08:35] covenant and the word ish means man or men therefore the word british is the covenant men or men of the covenant okay it's a fascinating story when we understand that our government is based on religion and we didn't even know it
[08:50] and i'm saying wake up do your homework okay you they you have such vast such you know a vast amount of information that i have to try and
[09:03] hold you back a minute because i want to get into more things okay i want to say some things here for one thing first let me let me say this how would you classify yourself are you
[09:16] are you religious or are you spiritual are you uh what somebody would say agnostic i mean what what are you i'm a common man an ordinary man
[09:30] in the pursuit of an extraordinary subject i consider myself to be one who appreciates and will fight for truth you are a truth seeker
[09:43] i think that's probably the the best way to determine i am an extremely spiritual person in that i hold very very high spiritual morals ethics
[09:55] i believe in a very powerful spiritual force that dominates and overshadows the world christians call it god others may call it something else but i have a very high respect for spirituality i have no time
[10:09] for religion as such anything that is organized by men quite certainly is not touching god i think that we have a direct connection with our creator with that great spiritual god force in the universe we
[10:24] don't need another man to intervene for us okay so then would you say that um let's say somebody might say well how dare you question the bible i mean how dare you
[10:38] write a book like this you must be a demon or something how would you answer that i would say the same thing has been said of solomon rushdie how dare you question the quran how dare you question uh the karl marx in the and the
[10:52] communist manifesto or mao and the little red book of mao i dare you question authority i'm saying that the man that we read about in the new testament the one called jesus if he
[11:04] taught us nothing it was to question authority because anytime you give away your spirituality and your authority and you do it yourself you know no one comes and hurt and turn and put your hand behind
[11:18] your back and forces you to give up your spirituality and your individual freedom and your right to be a human being and decide for yourself you do that yourself and when you do that and you give up your sovereignty to the government to
[11:32] the church to a religion to a book to a concept to anything you are enslaving yourself all i'm asking the public to do is do a little research see if what i'm saying is wrong and and
[11:46] judge for yourself i'm not advocating i'm not running for a political position i'm not trying to start my own church what i would like to see done as a as a spiritual revolution in this country where people say just
[12:00] say no just say no to organized religion just say no to organized government just say no to tyranny i don't care where it is and what color it is bigotry ignorance ill-informed stupidity just say no from
[12:13] here on out the point i'm making is that you need to do your homework you need to study and find out where things came from what happens what happens when they do find out
[12:26] what happens to those who who their whole life has been the bible there's so many people who have you know the bible is what keeps them going every day what will what will they have to replace the
[12:39] russians in the russia today ask the russians in russia today what is it like when you find out that you've been hoodwinked that your government was not the most powerful the most wonderful government on earth and
[12:53] now it has totally collapsed now what are you going to do you trusted you brought up your children you wasted your entire life and you went along to get along and now what happens your whole world is collapsing around you and why
[13:08] because you didn't do your homework and you didn't stand up for what was right when you could have you went along to get along because it was comfortable at the time and now it's very uncomfortable and i'm saying that that's what we all have to
[13:21] do is look at the uncomfortable facts that nothing is permanently on this earth permanently on this earth let's see they have here
[13:34] um bible model bible models bible morality they have here um who was jehovah and this is thomas thomas jefferson who wrote this who was jehovah a being of
[13:48] terrific character cruel vindictive capricious and unjust then also who was abraham an insane barbarian patriot who married his sister denied his wife who was jacob another
[14:02] patriot who won god's love by deceiving his father cheating his uncle rob and his brother this is bible morality now understand i didn't write that other authors are in the book okay but
[14:17] the point i wish to make one does not need to even read the book one can all all just read the bible and read and put flesh on the things which happen in the this is in the bible
[14:30] this is in the bible are you aware that there were 15. now let me ask you something are you aware that there were 15 other major religions this is history now okay now conjecture
[14:42] history there were 15 major theological religious religious movements in the world before christianity that taught exactly the same identical
[14:56] story of a messiah who came to the earth who was born in a manger who died on the cross who had 12 apostles who died with the crown of thorns are you aware that there were 15 major religions that had
[15:11] the same identical teachings of christianity most people aren't and i'm very suspect of a 16th religion which is copied off of 15 previous religions and i am told that this one is
[15:22] the truth i become very suspect that is that's the way i am as a teacher and as a researcher and a writer i become rather suspect and i tell you something else i'm very suspect and that is the connection between government and politics today in america
[15:38] i think both should be investigated and that's what this book attempts to do look behind the scenes of both our authorities in the world religion politics and money so when that happens people will actually have almost a
[15:52] renaissance of themselves let us hope so and a whole new type of uh person can come back you will agree that that's what we need our country is in trouble our families are in trouble our whole
[16:07] human race is in trouble and basically we can boil it down to three problems we all share on this earth in common religion politics and money and i'm telling you the three are not separate they are all one because in the
[16:22] ancient world the king always represented not only temporal power but also heavenly power he was the connection between the people and god that is why today we have a you cannot get married in this country today in america
[16:36] there is a we are told that there is a division between church and state no such division exists if you want to start a church you must get a 501 c 3 permit from the government you must get permits you must pay the fees you must
[16:50] do all of these legal things with the red tape of government before you can set up a church now once you've set up the church with all the government's permission and permits you cannot get married in this country unless you have a marriage licensed
[17:05] first then you can go to the minister and be married and if your marriage doesn't work out you don't go to god you go to a judge in a courtroom i'm telling you there's something going on here between religion and politics
[17:18] and its money its power and until such time as we're willing to to look at what's been going on in this country for over 200 years and be open-minded because your brain your mind is like a
[17:30] parachute it don't work if it's not open i'm telling we we can be exploited if we're not willing to open our minds open our hearts and say let's look at the facts because the fact is all over the world people are being led by religious
[17:44] leaders ayatollah khamenei and saddam hussein are just two of many people and in this country we we put things on the back of our car support our troops in the middle east you don't even know what they were doing in the middle east
[17:58] do you think that has something to do with politics okay religion and politics do you think that has something to do with this what we call this new world order this global um uh unification that you can bet on you do i think that i can
[18:13] make a very good case of that in a court of law if given an opportunity if you look at the symbols on the back of the one dollar bill the pyramid on the back of the one dollar bill above the pyramid on the back of a one dollar bill look at it you'll see and i know it coeptus i
[18:27] know what collapses in latin means our enterprise is now a success or our project is now a success look at the wording of the on the banner beneath the pyramid novas or dosaklurum no vasa
[18:42] is new order of the world the new world order why is an egyptian pyramid on an american dollar bill are you aware of the symbolism going on here like the washington monument in washington d.c you know what the washington monument
[18:57] stands for it stands for the male erection and it connects right down the waters of life to the oval office the oval is the female the washington monument is the mail it has to do with
[19:10] religion it has to do with sex has to do with it political power and we take these instruments and they we think we take these symbols and we think they're so marvelous do your homework and you'll find out that so much of what we consider to be
[19:24] holy and righteous is in fact nothing more than sex religion and money and most people pretty well know that but no one has actually bothered to confront the establishment
[19:38] i hope to do that i want to confront the establishment for the one reason i think that the truth is an idea whose time has come i think we've all been manipulated and exploited and it's time we look at the real truth that's well i think that
[19:52] a lot of people are somewhat walking around in a daze things are happening they don't they don't know where to turn and they they i think that many of them um
[20:05] they don't really feel very happy with what they receiving in church when they do go to church you know they feel something is wrong it's because something is wrong it's not true the things which we have
[20:17] been told are not true you can prove this in any good library all one has to do is do something you've never done before go to a library and spend all day reading theology and you will find the
[20:31] world has known for thousands of years that these stories are nothing more than stories now um as a matter of fact rita the bible is called the greatest story ever told
[20:45] the greatest story not the greatest collection of facts not the most paramount uh document on earth the greatest story ever told it's a story one must know how to read the symbols
[20:58] and the emblems and the terms and that is why the symbols in the in the bible too are in the bible everywhere i mean did you know for instance that the book of revelation was not written by christians the book of
[21:12] revelation was around for at least 500 years before christianity ever came into existence the book of revelation was already in circulation no john ever wrote the book of revelation his name
[21:25] was ion ion from the ionian sea and when in in in latin when you change eyes to j it becomes j-o-n but in the english it becomes j-o-h-n
[21:39] so today we're told that john wrote the book of revelation no such john ever wrote the book of revelation it was written 500 years before christ was ever born oh this is just just it's just you know it's earth shaking
[21:54] wait till the real truth comes out about religion and politics in america and you're going to see the earth shape are you ready for the tomatoes are you ready i've already gotten it many times okay now in the book um the book your church
[22:08] doesn't want you to read you have an article astro theology yes right and who edited the book with with tim liedem he was our editor tim leedham okay he's the editor of the book and i
[22:21] helped him co-edit it but i also uh did a chapter on astro theology theology and i wanted to say also steve allen yeah also steve allen is a very brilliant writer and he right it's a
[22:33] part of our book now um you you have now we opened up the show with uh thomas paine discussion by him but you also you must like thomas paine because you also have him absolutely incredible okay he wrote
[22:48] um the christian religion is a parody on the worship of the son in which they put a man whom they call christ in the place of the son and pay him the same authorization
[23:02] which was originally paid to the son why did you select thomas paine and tell me more about this oscillator because that is a classic comment about astro theology astro theology is the basis for all
[23:16] religion and the world period astro what does that astral theology theology is the worship of religion theology and astral is the heavens the worship of the heavens
[23:29] from as far back in history as we can go man has always worshipped the heavens that's why we're even told in western civilization that when you die you'll go to heaven and then of course the the interesting
[23:43] point that thomas paine was making is the same one that i continue to make that the whole concept of the sun s-s-o-n god's son goes directly back to the old uh concept
[23:57] of god's son s-u-n being the risen savior because the son is the risen savior it does rise and of course god's son s-u-n uh the egyptians said had an evil
[24:11] brother he was the prince of darkness and he came out at night to rule the world when god's son died and went away the world was in the hands of the prince of darkness and his name was set and he came out at sunset
[24:26] okay today uh even the egyptians the egyptians said that that newborn son that came up every morning his name was horus and they would come out in the temples of karnak and the temple the thieves and and
[24:39] heliopolis egypt and when the sun would come up in the morning as they still do in the islamic faith they would meet in the morning to greet the coming of the new sun we do it in in in easter we have easter sunrise services
[24:56] yes horizon right horus rising that's where we get the word horizon i'm saying that there are 15 major religions in the world before christianity that have taught the same thing it is a very
[25:10] ancient old story that's why the bible is called the greatest story ever told so now i'm not saying there's not good spirituality in the bible i am saying that it has been twisted and used by political powers for a political agenda
[25:25] to keep us ignorant ill-informed and unread depending on the lord to come back to help us when in fact there is no lord coming back to help us education knowledge and your own
[25:38] personal spirituality and investigation of what the story is really about do your homework that's the only salvation we have left um well there's a few questions i wanted to ask you but okay
[25:54] what about there's no adam and eve no the word no adam comes from the word adam no that's why the the hebrews do not have do not take part in christianity
[26:06] uh the jews do not accept jesus as the messiah and many many christians jumping to conclusions say well the jews don't accept jesus that's because they hated the messiah no no such thing as true the reason why jews do not accept
[26:20] christianity is really rather simple they know the story and they know it's just the story it's the gentiles that don't know this what we need to do is wake up and find out that this is a story what is the
[26:35] story telling us now um in our last discussion you were saying that the uh the government which says

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
26:48] about separation of church and state but that that is not true i don't believe that the government is very much involved with religion yes yes uh actually if you'll go back to the very beginnings of mankind there's
[27:03] always been this uh coexistence between government and religion between church and state and of course in all the ancient empires the king also was the mediator between god and man so he wasn't just the king
[27:16] of the state he was also the mediator between his people and god uh up until the time of the french revolution that was always the case even in europe uh with the papacy uh today of course we in america like to believe that we have a
[27:30] division between church and state but it is my proposition and my idea that there that no such division exists that the church as we know it today and western civilization is in fact nothing more
[27:43] than a tool and a counterpart to government is that like two hands government and religion both helping the one mind to to do its work and so that's what i am intending to do
[27:58] is to enlighten people as to where government ideas concepts and belief systems have come from and theology and religion and where those ideas have come from and show the connections behind the scenes of how we
[28:11] because we're unread in the field are being manipulated and exploited by government and religion and i think it's an idea whose time has come and you asked me before what kind of a reception i get i get a very powerful uh
[28:26] positive response when i was in new york on abc new york with bob grant i was supposed to do a half hour interview i ended up doing a two hour interview the response was overwhelmingly positive
[28:39] many people in our country know instinctively that there's something going on in big government big business big money and big religion and everyone seems to know that but no one has uh as of yet
[28:53] gone into and brought out all of the facts surrounding religion and government in our country and the monetary and the money connection okay that's what i'm trying to do yes now wouldn't you say that um
[29:11] that that allows in other words if you if if people begin to see what you're saying and i mean our government it's it
[29:24] the guidelines it's it's based upon the moral guidelines is based upon religion right absolutely now if you take away the religion what will happen to the moral guidelines well i i won't have any you see i don't
[29:37] know i'm making the distinction here i'm not talking about spirituality i am a very highly spiritual person i believe in a divine overshadowing in the universe i believe you believe in them absolutely in a divine
[29:51] god or creator i totally am convinced that there is a divine essence to us and and so i have no problem with spirituality what makes you convinced well i'm talking about organized religion no no but what makes you
[30:06] convinced about that that we do have a divine oh i think that there are far too many things that happen to all human beings that we know that there's more to life than just us i think that we've all had too many uh experiences every one of
[30:21] us have had experiences uh some even more so than others right but uh to prove that there is some sort of a spiritual our spiritual dynamics to our life uh i myself have had many
[30:34] experiences in a spiritual way to convince me that i am not here on this earth by myself uh that there are spirits here i believe in a god or a creator i have no problem as i said with spirituality i have a very big
[30:49] problem with government money and religion yes that's something somewhat contaminates the the the beauty of the the divine essence absolutely that is there no doubt about it and they uh we have the best
[31:03] politicians and religious leaders that money can buy and i'm tired of that so can i just ask you something kind of thrown off a little bit um do you believe in reincarnation and what
[31:17] what does the bible say about that and well i believe that i think that you can make a good case for this that in the bible in the old testament and the new uh i believe that there was much in the
[31:28] old and new testament uh to support uh reincarnation but was dropped out and taken out during the middle ages because we know that happened we know many scriptures were were deleted and some things were put in that
[31:44] were not in the original so i think that the the scriptures dealing in both in the old and new testament with reincarnation were taken out purposely because the church felt that that would be uh harmful to the people to think that they come
[31:59] back and they come back again because if you keep coming back before god and and other lifetimes then why do you need to contribute to the church today why do you actually absolutely why do you even need to go to church today or to even hear the priest if you're going to come
[32:13] back the next time and do it over again anyway so i think the church said no none of this we have to take that out and let let everyone believe that they only have one time through and that's it so you have to be in subjection to religion oh so that right there shows
[32:26] the government being involved with the well i mean even in uh european history it's uh our history of europe is filled with the papacy and the pope of rome being involved with the kings and the princes of uh europe and of course that's
[32:40] referred to as the old order of the world the old world order and of course in america we have our religious political foundations and we call ourselves a new world order that's on the dollar bill the back of
[32:53] the dollar bill so there's a lot of connections behind the scenes between major religion big money and government and that's what the book is about the book your church does not want you to read it's just a general anthology on
[33:07] all of the things that are in religion that the churches don't want you to know about now um as we explore this what happens to people as they become more enlightened
[33:24] else will i mean i cannot believe i can't think of of people not ever having a church in their life um church seems to mean so much give so much more i mean how would the church be completely
[33:38] changed would we ever have a church again well i mean did they have churches and then adam and eve's day i mean when when creation first began and the ancient peoples of the ancient world that they have churches you see i'm saying that there's
[33:53] a very big difference between religion which requires a church in the clergy and money and organization as opposed to spirituality within your individual self spiritually between you
[34:06] and your divine creator i don't believe that there is necessity for a church synagogue or whatever i think that the spirituality is between you and your creator so i don't see a need for the church because
[34:20] i think i kind of pick up what you're saying is that you want to bring back the essence and the innocence of people yes and not absolutely have it all of this instruments of um
[34:34] like entertainment entertainment right right and so i see nothing spiritual in in in the church television and church radio i see nothing more than the madison avenue promotion of religion
[34:48] that always and in every way supports government that would be a major uh metamorphosis for people yes if that was to ever happen i think that's going to happen i think that we are being forced uh by
[35:02] events in the world to wake up and and begin to question our foundations and our belief systems uh we expect the arabs to do so we expect the the hindus to examine their foundations and see that
[35:17] they are the need to examine what they believe and it's very good for everyone else in the world to examine what they believe so why isn't it good for us to do the same so now that um
[35:30] freemasonry is that the one is that where symbolism started coming about i mean let me explain why i got into symbolism as you said in the beginning of the program my my mother had an uncle who worked in the
[35:42] vatican secretary of state's office and every few years he would come back to this country and he would sit and talk for days about all the intrigue going on behind the scenes of religion and politics and it was very interesting
[35:56] conversation because and i was just a small child growing up but i would hear him and i would hear this kind of conversation where he would deal with symbols and emblems and secret societies and fraternal orders and the wars and
[36:09] revolutions to show us any symbols well we we don't have that with us tonight but we do have a few slides that we'll get into in a few minutes uh dealing with the foundations of western religion but in relation to the symbols all of these
[36:24] emblems and symbols mean something to us you know on and so many people are unaware i mean the bible has jesus saying many will look with their eyes but not see and that is certainly true people look at symbols all day long and have no idea in the world what they mean
[36:39] and symbols are very important and if you don't think so watch someone wearing a swastika go into a synagogue and watch the reaction that the jews will have when they see the swastika because symbols mean something they have very
[36:52] powerful been wondering about the swastika it's isn't it like a course well it's the hindu originally the swastika from germany was a hindu symbol um and and of course then it
[37:05] it generated down into finally the nazis picked it up like many other nations and other people picked it up too the american indians and then the buddhists have the yes we're going to go to the slides and i think yes if you'd like we can go to the slides i was just going to
[37:20] um i'm just going to make mention about the foundations of western religion oh maybe we're going to do that on part uh the the next show we can well let's go on with this instance we've already introduced the uh the idea of western religion
[37:35] of course we know that the western religion is based on a far older uh bible the bible the old testament uh even further back if you'll go back into the most ancient history of the
[37:48] world in the middle east especially you will see as we will show you now the uh the volcano was one of the many uh things that were worshiped at the ancient world the volcano was very
[38:02] important because it represented a life and creation and it had a sexual connotation that's why today in most men's rooms and hotels or restaurants there will always be a triangle on the door
[38:16] triangle being the the pyramid pyramid comes from the word pyrrha meaning fire and mid meaning middle the fire of sexual generation is in the middle of the human body that's why the volcano always represented sex are they coming
[38:31] of life in the fire of life that brings new life to the world so the volcano was a very important symbol to the ancient people we'll go to the next slide and we will see how now here is the encyclopedia
[38:45] discussion of and let's go to we'll see it says the volcano like any other uh impressive or fearful aspect of nature volcanoes have become the objects of worship
[38:58] for human beings from the earliest stone age yet the original yahweh which is one of the gods of the old testament the original yahweh seems to have begun as a volcano god also
[39:11] mount sinai where moses encountered him as was the seat of the midianite god and in the midianites earliest homeland he was identified with the local moon
[39:24] god sin which is where we get the name for the mountain in uh in the middle east sinai or cyanide comes from the old moon god's sin uh after whom the mountain was named the appearance of yahweh as i said yahweh is
[39:39] one of the old one of the ancient gods of the old testament and the reference work says the appearance of yahweh as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night so that's the way the old testament god
[39:52] yahweh appeared and that was found in exodus 13 21 and 22. now the word volcano and this is important now the word volcano and let's go back to it here it is the word volcano comes from
[40:06] the latin volcano god balkan or volcanoes derived from the occasion deity volcanoes i want to repeat that this is the most important that the word let's go back to the slide because i want to show that
[40:20] that the word volcano comes from the latin volcano god balkan okay let's take the next slide now we're talking about the old volcano god let's go to the next one
[40:33] now here we have the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night we see the israelites in the in the desert and there's the god representation and uh we'll go to the next slide now
[40:48] and see that in the middle here's a reference work on job 38 now on the reference work of job 38 it says thunder is called an hebrew koat or voices for it is considered the voice of god
[41:02] so here we have thunder which is called in hebrew co-op or voices for it is considered the voice of god let's go to the next one uh okay there it is again we're just
[41:15] saying the thunder is voices it's considered the voice of god next one now here in job 38 we will go to the top uh one first in job 38 1 in the footnote it
[41:28] talks about the storm this is the storm the clouds of guard's tent again unless he is gathered as the thunder the voice of yahweh now if you can zoom in on that a little bit we can see that clearer right there
[41:43] so we see that god's tent are gathered as the thunder which is the voice of yahweh roars they descend and god shoots his arrows of his lightning so we're talking about yahweh the god of the old testament with his thunder and his arrows of
[41:58] lightning and then beneath it we'll see on the bottom in hebrew it says god thunders wonderfully we can see the bottom line can we god thunders wonderfully can we see the
[42:10] bottom line yes god thunders wonderfully with his voice okay let's go on so now we see that thunder and lightning is connected to the old volcano god
[42:24] the god of the volcano the next slide here we have and we can zoom in on the a little bit on the bottom we can see that at mount sinai jehovah performed signs the mountain trembled and smoked
[42:39] all over millions now heard and proof that what moses had been known in god's name was actually the word of god now for back off you can see that the israelites are at mount sinai and if you'll back off you'll see that
[42:53] that is uh mount sinai is pictured here in the biblical text as a volcano the next slide now here we have jehovah let's go in and get that a little bit closer so we can
[43:08] see that jehovah led the sons of israel to the mountain named sinai and there he gave them his law now look at the mountain and you will see the mountain at sinai where uh the israelites
[43:21] encounter yahweh jehovah is actually the volcano now let's go again to the next one okay now there we have the uh in the in the uh reference work of the hebrew holidays
[43:36] we have rosh hashanah and uh yom kippur and the next slide the next one we will see is another set of holidays with the passover and now on the bottom
[43:51] we will see that let's bring it in and a little bit closer on the bottom and we'll see one of the holidays is the feast of the giving of the law so here's where moses was given the law from mount sinai now let's go to the
[44:06] next slide and i think we'll have a better picture of that okay we'll back off a little bit there it is now we're seeing that this is the feast of the giving of the law which coincides with the feast of the first fruits
[44:20] let's go to the next picture which will bring that picture up a little closer i think and there we see the volcano again at mount sinai so we're seeing that yahweh the one of
[44:33] the one of the different gods one of the many gods of the old testament is pictured here as the volcano god all right now we go to part two which is the closing part of this section of
[44:45] let's go to the next slide we will see here now the um let's see okay now you'll see here on the torah and the um you'll see the benediction symbol now let's go
[44:59] on let's go to the next one this is the rabbinical benediction symbol that's the blessing the blessing symbol that the uh that the rabbis bless the congregation next one
[45:11] okay now we see the the high priest of israel blessing and you'll see the hands raised in the priestly blessing for yahweh the volcano god or vulcan okay we'll go to the next
[45:26] picture there again in the synagogue in los angeles let's go to the next picture i think we've got a better one and you will see there we go we have the uh the uh the prophet giving the benediction symbol one more now let's go
[45:40] to the next one all right there is the move in on that if we can a little bit you'll see the hands a bit the pentatonic scroll crown with hands raised in the priestly blessing so we see this is a priestly blessing in the
[45:54] hebrew all right now we'll go on one more let's go to the next one here is the rabbi giving the priestly blessing for yahweh at the synagogue and one more which is the last picture will be
[46:07] explaining why mr spock gives the priestly blessing the next picture uh the priestly blessing and that's why mr spock is called a balkan that was the whole idea of the balkan comes from
[46:21] vulcanus or the old christian deity which was later to be found in the old testament under the name of yahweh and that ends the slide presentation so the point i'm making is that when we
[46:34] find the foundations for our religious movements in america and in europe and then we find that from those foundations of the religious movements we have our political movements and so therefore uh what we need to do is understand that
[46:48] our religions and our politics are both one and the same and if we're under the law and and have to be a nation under law uh the law is of course the law from the old volcano christian volcano god
[47:01] volcanis the vulcan so i'm saying uh as i said there are two kinds of facts in theology there's the kind you look up in the kind you make up and i'm all i'm saying is that there's been a lot of
[47:13] theology that has been given to us but people need to do their homework because so much that we've been given which is holy comes to find out when you do your homework is not that holy can i ask you one more thing um
[47:27] okay we know all of the symbols and so forth what about this thing that we i'm going to ask you something that a viewer may ask what about the
[47:39] nor and the k and the curse of k kanan yes well it was actually the curse of canaan uh supposedly explains where the black man comes from because he was cursed by god
[47:52] that is that is a horrible misuse of scripture and i think it's too much of a subject to get into now suffice it to say that it was purposely used by people who knew
[48:05] better when they were using it that it was not a curse on the black man that has to do with cana and the canaanites and the curse of the canaanites canaanites were not black people black
[48:18] people were africans not canaanites so um you know we can dispense with that it was misused scripture is that something that we could have another topic yeah that would be a very interesting one when you get into cana
[48:30] and babylon and how today the babylonian empire still rules in our world today our symbols and our emblems come directly from cana and babylon so if there's a curse we're enjoying it right now
[48:44] okay so that's something we can come back and talk about it on that um okay all right so now you don't feel that this is going to when you take this
[49:02] no i think any time i think it is a privilege to educate and help people to understand what like what's going on yeah okay i am absolutely enthralled and i mean i'm
[49:17] you know i feel it's such a treat that you have come to be with us and to share this information with us the secret societies is a very profound subject and it's one that
[49:30] most people just have never even looked at very closely for something that is so powerful and so important in our day the societies which control our country
[49:42] from behind the scenes it's uh it's really important for us to understand how they got here and the symbols which are used symbols occult symbols are like letters of the alphabet
[49:56] put them together and they tell a story but if you can't read the symbols you don't understand the story and so a classic example i'd like to bring to your audience is attention is like on the dollar bill on the back of the one dollar bill everyone's
[50:11] has a one dollar bill in their pocket but very few people have ever looked at the symbolism on the back of a one dollar bill there's much talk going on today in washington about a new world order if we look at the back of the dollar
[50:24] bill the one dollar bill on the left hand side you'll see the magic circle and within that magic circle is the pyramid with the all-seeing eye separated from the body of the pyramid
[50:38] and above the top of the pyramid the uh just above the eye you have anuit coeptus which is latin for i knew it means our enterprise or our project coeptis uh
[50:52] basically means has been crowned with success or is now a success therefore our newest co-op this is our enterprise is now a success now what was that enterprise now that's right now the enterprise itself is beneath the pyramid
[51:05] novas ordo is all latin novas is for new ordo is order and sichlorium is for the secular secular is like your secular job your secular education which means
[51:20] worldly or your the secular world therefore novas or dosaglorum is new world order a term that we hear quite frequently today exactly now the interesting thing about this symbol of the new world order
[51:35] why is it pictured beneath an egyptian pyramid pyramids are in egypt and so there's a reason why egypt has played such a very big part in america america is to the secret societies of
[51:48] the world america is referred to as the new egypt and therefore our symbols are from egypt like in washington dc you have the obelisk of the white house the obelisk is cleopatra's needle known
[52:03] as washington monument the washington monument is nothing more than the egyptian uh cleopatra's needle the as a matter of fact if you fly over washington dc and look down and you have

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
52:15] pictures in libraries of washington dc from the air you will see that it is laid out in a tremendous pyramid with the capitol building in the triangle at the top there's the long waterway which is the
[52:29] river styx which is out in front of the cleopatra's needle and of course at the end is the magic circle the masonic circle so it's all has to do with ancient occult secret societies
[52:42] fraternal orders and their symbolism now the question is some viewers may be wondering why the writing why is it in latin and not in uh some african language because that's a very good observation
[52:57] because it is african symbolism but latin language because the um how would you say the the new order was going to be made up of a white society a white elitist society
[53:12] and it would be based on the old mysticism and religion and philosophy of africa but it would be a new africa or a new egypt so you're saying that new societies go all the way back into the
[53:26] yes it goes all the great back right as a matter of fact if you remember the the pyramids are made out of bricks and those who work in the ancient world what bricks will call stone masons and that's of course what we get today the masonic societies or the masons who
[53:41] work with bricks so that almost all freemasons realize that their fraternity of freemasonry goes all the way back into the ancient world into the first dynasties of egypt and all of their symbolism comes from
[53:53] from egypt but what's important is to understand that today in order to understand when the president says the new world order and you hear this term quite often now let me explain to you what's being said
[54:06] when you hear the words new world order america is referred to as the new world christopher columbus discovers the new world well the old world is europe and that and for
[54:20] almost 2 000 years europe has controlled the world europe has dominated the world and rome has dominated europe so for almost 2 000 years rome or the
[54:33] roman church the roman authority of europe uh through their ancient houses their their fraternal houses have controlled europe and europe has dominated the world none of the crusades have anything to do with that
[54:48] absolutely that's exactly right that's why steven spielberg in the george lucas movies with indiana jones and the last crusade because you can't understand the last crusade if you don't understand the first one and it has to do with the lost ark and
[55:02] that's why raiders of the lost ark the ark of covenant and now incidentally in that what raiders of the lost ark where were they looking for the lost ark in jerusalem in palestine in the holy city no in egypt
[55:16] they were looking for the lost ark in egypt because that's exactly where the ark originally was in egypt it was an african symbol it was purely an african symbol the ark and later on it was brought into modern use and
[55:30] in the bible is referred to as the ark of the covenant but actually it comes from egypt it's a much older symbol but anyway if you think about the power base in europe being the old world european the old world and those powers that are behind
[55:45] the throne of europe dominating the world that was an order like the masonic order or an order of priesthood you know the orders of uh you know the fraternal order now as i reflect on history several united
[55:59] states presidents belong to the messiah quite a few as a matter of fact uh the founders of the united states um the uh founders of the country the signers of the constitution were all freemasons except for the few
[56:13] that were secretions and there were a few others that were of other fraternal orders uh in that respect it's interesting to do a little research in your in your history books on an order called the peoria di sayon
[56:25] the holy house of scion s s-i-o-n not z-i-o-n peori d-siom it's a very powerful secret society that's even in existence in the south of
[56:38] france today and that's why of course south of france has always been a very mystical place for occult societies the cathars of course and the albigensian crusades but let me get back to this point about
[56:52] rome dominating europe and europe dominating the world rome the roman church today was the power of europe and that was the old world order the order of the old world but with the coming of america we have a new
[57:07] world order and therefore is the power elite power base which is america the new order are you saying that that power was passed on that's right the
[57:20] power was passed on to them they see that in taking well they actually they actually in fact seized it and took it and and moved the power base from europe to america and therefore the order that
[57:34] now is directing affairs behind the scenes in america is is referred to by people on the inside as the new order the new world order because america is as i said the new world and so when we understand what the
[57:48] symbolism on the dollar bill and it's just an enormous subject getting into the motion pictures hollywood as a men's incidentally the magic practicing priest of the old celtics priest the old babylonian
[58:02] celtic priest of uh of europe had magic wands and the magic wands were always made out of holly wood and that's why because they would work their magic and holly with hollywood
[58:16] and of course the secret societies are still today working their magic with hollywood we use this terminology uh secret societies are they really secret well they they you see those
[58:30] that not all of them are secret many are semi-secret societies uh and the 35 years that i've been interested in this subject i find that there is always going to be many people
[58:44] who have come out of societies for whatever purpose and for whatever reason and begin to devour some of the materials and some of the things that were going on behind the scenes usually we hear about this like 50 to 60 to 100
[58:59] years later someone we finally find out wrote a book or something and then we look back and then we can see why things happen the way they did but today our world is totally in the grips of secret societies the middle east is
[59:13] is dominated by some very powerful secret societies that work on fraternal orders that's the reason why george bush had the uh the troops in the middle east it was to show power to other secret
[59:26] societies so to speak who is actually in control of the middle east i want to ask this question for a viewer that may be out there wondering uh what about the republican and democratic party well george washington
[59:42] i didn't write this i'm just relating it to you george washington mentioned uh in one of his letters uh actually two letters to a reverend in 1794 something like that that
[59:56] the that there was a secret society operating in washington at the time and he referred to it as the democratic societies which was later to become known as the democratic party and he said that this
[01:00:09] society of the democratic society or democratic party was absolutely a very um what was this word subversive movement within the republic and it had as its
[01:00:23] motive it has as its motive the dividing of the people from their government to divide the people from their government so that you would send your your your elected leaders your democratically elected leaders to washington not realizing that those
[01:00:39] elected leaders would be members of secret societies and fraternal orders which would be working in in in concert with the secret societies in washington and you have to understand that
[01:00:50] washington dc is a very powerful spot in the world for secret activities like ross perot yeah well ross perot i mean he's even a newcomer i i go back into uh
[01:01:04] woodrow wilson's day where joe wilson's connections with occult orders and they're called symbols on the dollar bill there's an interesting point about the dollar bill on the right hand side with the eagle of course the eagle is the old
[01:01:17] phoenix symbol of rising from the ashes of destruction coming for the uh from the old roman symbols which even goes back even further than that but uh above the eagle on the right hand side of the dollar bill you'll see 13 stars just
[01:01:31] above the eagle's head 13 stars and there are 13 cloud bursts around the 13 stars there were 13 feathers in the wings there were 13 stripes in the shield on one side there are 13 arrows the
[01:01:45] other side at the bottom there are 13 leaves and 13 berries in the leaves the pyramid on the left hand side has 13 layers now what is very symbolic well it's just the the most important thing is the 13.
[01:01:59] y is 13 so dominating the the dollar bill because 13 is a very powerful mystical number two secret societies because uh incidentally uh our 13 colonies the original colonies
[01:02:14] were uh the reason why we didn't have uh 42 colonies why we have 10 colonies so 127 colonies why do we have 13. now some viewer out there might say well 13 is unlucky number that's right 13 is an unlucky number for you
[01:02:28] that's the point 13 is unlucky for you to use because it's a holy number the 13 is based on jesus and his 12. jesus and his 12 make the 13. the 12 uh
[01:02:41] followers of jesus were called in the bible the cornerstones of the of the new world order the cornerstones jesus is twice referred to in the new testament as the
[01:02:53] chief cornerstone the builders rejected the chief cornerstone the word chief cornerstone of the bible is a greek word means the peak of a pyramid that's what it means so they're the top of a pyramid
[01:03:06] therefore that peak of the pyramid is a chief cornerstone and according to the old occultic understanding of the old kabbalistic understanding of the bible that that pyramid at the top with the eye the eye
[01:03:20] is of course jesus the eye goes back to of course horus which was the son in the ancient egyptian and of course today we have that eye on the dollar bill representing
[01:03:32] jesus or god's son now do you know the person that designed the artist yes the artist that designed uh i'm not sure exactly who designed it originally but that symbol on the dollar bill on the left
[01:03:46] hand side with the pyramid has been in existence just as it is today was in existence in 1774 in bavaria south of germany in bavaria there was an organization a secret
[01:04:01] society a fraternal order uh called the illuminati they used that exact identical symbol you can still see it in the european uh
[01:04:12] libraries and museums the question is how does it end up on an american dollar bill that's the question if it was an old german secret society well that gets into uh some of the fraternal orders that are behind the
[01:04:28] throne in america uh there's such a vast subject uh which leads me up to a question not to cut you off but what is the impact of secret societies
[01:04:41] on american politics today it it absolutely is the heart the blood and the brains behind america today of secret societies the republican party as
[01:04:53] one hand the democratic party is another and the brain is the secret societies behind the scenes very powerful intelligent uh people are at work behind the scenes
[01:05:07] governing both the democratic and the republican party well i was just going to say so in fact in point of fact it doesn't matter who is made president the power
[01:05:20] is always going to be in the hands of the people behind the scenes that's why in america we have a right to elect we love to talk about our right to elect but we don't have a right to see lack
[01:05:34] that is decided upon by those who are in power like today the democratic clinton and the the democratic candidate uh clinton is a member of the uh as a very
[01:05:48] well well-educated man he is a rhodes scholar and if you understand what the rhodes scholarship comes from sessa rhodes cecil rhodes of south africa and cecil rhodes said that he was going to leave his
[01:06:00] millions and millions of dollars to set up a secret society that would be uh teaching young white people young white men to be able to come into power and handle the power
[01:06:14] of a very vast new world government in which the you know and so that was the dream of cecil rhodes to be able to uh to create a secret society that could dominate the world from behind the
[01:06:29] scenes and do it with such expertise that no one should ever even get the knowledge of it no it seems like the winds have changed you hear that statement quite frequently when it comes to politics and and people uprising to
[01:06:42] change governments the secret society have any impact for the situation that's going on in europe absolutely as secret societies have have to do with everything that's going on in the entire world you can you you have to
[01:06:56] know that where there is politics there's money where there's money in politics is religion and there are powerful forces at work right now in yugoslavia there are books written 20 years ago uh talking about how the secret
[01:07:10] societies in the 90s the early 90s were going to break up yugoslavia and they had already designed how they were going to do it who they were going to you know start the war with and how they were going to start it 20 years ago
[01:07:24] books were written about yugoslavia that's just one example and if you in that type of research you can pretty well tell what's coming down the line you can already tell the uh who's going to be doing what if you
[01:07:37] understand the story as i said if you can read the symbols now a question for viewers out there you're not just predicting doom what can the american people do or people that's that want to change what can they do to
[01:07:51] expose these societies well let me say this i am directing my words my work what i do i am directing my my comments and my work only to a select people only to select
[01:08:06] few and that is those who really care about their lives those who really care about the country they live in those who really care about freedom liberty and i believe that the most important thing one can do is to educate your mind
[01:08:22] first because that's where real freedom is is in the intellect spiritual and intellectual freedom and without that kind of freedom and things you don't understand things you don't know
[01:08:35] being not a not being able to read symbols that's where they have you because you don't understand the game that's being played in the world surrounded with symbols and images right and so one needs to take the time to explore right the history of
[01:08:50] these and see what they really mean now a question you're a very noted lecturer you will be doing some events sometime yes as a matter of fact i'm going to be uh doing some radio programs i already have i was in abc new york i
[01:09:03] did a two-hour show there and that was very exciting i just we just did a a program for cbs i was on cbs special on ancient mysteries of the bible
[01:09:17] i'm doing a program for nbc probably uh hopefully that's in the works all right uh and also i've i've just uh done some radio programs here in los angeles and you're also going to do a uh
[01:09:30] book tour a lecture right to the various independent bookstores throughout southern california right right now sometime this month as america as a matter of fact yes and black and latino multicultural bookstore
[01:09:44] uh i'm going to be uh giving a lecture there also and that's for the general public yes for the general public and uh and there's there's just an enormous amount of material a lot of people might think that this is the kind of a subject that you'd have to be in government or
[01:09:58] behind the scenes you'd be surprised how much material is actually out there if you just know where it is well this is the information age just dubbed that that's right we're living in the information capital of the world right i should say most of the information that
[01:10:12] you probably acquired you got right here in the united states oh sure absolutely it's interesting too that your your listeners might be interested to know why our country is ruled from um the district of columbia
[01:10:25] and why we have columbia broadcasting system in columbia university and uh and a space shuttle is columbia and of course the columbia broadcasting cbs columbia broadcasting television has the symbol of the
[01:10:40] all-seeing eye the eye on the dollar bill the united states has ruled from the white house not black house or brown house but from the white house and england is of course ruled from the
[01:10:55] white hall which is like the masonic hall the lodge hall or england's government comes from white hall america's from the white house so they're symbols and emblems and they
[01:11:07] mean something and i might also interject this this i consider to be very important when the new king of england is crowned prince charles is made king listen to the words that the archbishop of canterbury will say to the new king
[01:11:22] in his initiation ceremony he says that the king of england is taking this position of king for jesus christ and ruling for jesus christ ruling for jehovah on god's throne
[01:11:36] and that that is why god's kingdom is represented by the united kingdom the united kingdom is god's kingdom and of course rome has a terrible dispute with that rome had a dispute
[01:11:51] with with england being the center for god's kingdom of the united kingdom the pope felt that he was the vicar of christ and that was the basis for two world wars that we got involved in
[01:12:05] as to who and what secret society was going to be in dominating the world the old world of rome or the new world of anglo-american as you have seen
[01:12:18] world politics is actually based on religion and a very good place to begin your research would be the history of the christian religion to the year 200 556 page hardback in limited supply
[01:12:32] and a most exciting book called symbols sex in the stars this is one of my most favorite books it's 396 page

[00:00] hello i'm jordan maxwell the video you're about to watch is composed of three separate half an hour interviews that were conducted not too long ago the lady that will be interviewing me is rita dyson
[00:14] the man is ralph walker uh the response to these three half-hour interviews when they first aired was so favorable that we felt that we wanted to put them together into one program and
[00:28] we hope that you will enjoy them and of course we would be very happy to hear from you if you'd like to have some further you know further information i want to thank you for your time
[00:42] [Music]
[01:06] of all the tyrannies that affect mankind tyranny and religion is the worst every other species of tyranny is limited to the world we live in a religion attempts to strive beyond the
[01:22] grave and seeks to pursue us into eternity thomas payne jordan you you've got to tell me about yourself um well rita first of all let me thank you
[01:36] for inviting me back and i enjoy being here with you uh as i told you before and privately the way i involve myself in this is it comes by me naturally because when my mother when i was growing up with a little kid
[01:49] my mother had an uncle who worked in the vatican secretary of state's office and about every three or four years he'd come back to the country to visit the family and as a little kid i would sit and listen to this uh this
[02:02] brilliant uh gentleman talking about international intrigue politics of the highest levels and he was quite knowledgeable working in the vatican secretary of state's office and the things he would talk
[02:15] about the secret societies the the money that was made throughout the world internationally the politics and generally the entire world scheme of things how politics and religion work
[02:29] together behind the scenes so i grew up hearing this kind of conversation and my grandfather was a senator my great-grandfather was a congressman i have two living uncles today who are federal judges
[02:42] so i grew up around hearing this type of conversation in the family about intriguing politics and the behind the scenes stuff going on in world religion
[02:55] at the ripe old age of 17 i decided that i wanted to find out if there was a bottom to this issue and i began my research and study into theology and all of the uh
[03:08] arcane or occult theologies of the world i was fascinated by some of the most powerful movements in the world and i have come to the conclusion that there has never been on
[03:22] this earth a political movement that wasn't a little religious and there's never been a religious movement in the history of the world that wasn't a little political but the problem you run into with theology and when you get into religion
[03:37] and theology is that there are two kinds of facts that we have in theology the kind you look up and the kind you make up and so much of what we have been uh told
[03:50] uh and be left to believe is true in theology and religion especially in the western world is nothing more in my opinion than political propaganda and i think this can be proven but over
[04:03] and above the political aspect of western religion i am also fascinated as this book brings out it's just a general anthology on religion just generally things which most people don't know
[04:16] about theology and religion that the church would rather you not know for instance we get into i get into in particular the uh the connection between astro theology which is the world's oldest religion
[04:31] you can go back to five to seven thousand years before christ and the worship of the heavens what dominated the ancient world i as i said i don't believe that there are too many
[04:44] people today in the western civilization who have really looked at where religion came from where our ideas and concept have come from now we don't mind we are all aware
[04:57] of how other people can be wrong and what they believe because other people we have a theology and other people have a mythology other people are wrong because they don't have they don't share your
[05:11] concepts and your belief and that's because they don't understand they're wrong but they don't understand i am saying that we can all be wrong there's not one human creature on the earth that that is so well informed that
[05:24] they cannot possibly be wrong on something all i'm asking my audience to do is to look at the facts of where western religion has come from and look at behind the scenes
[05:37] uh the connections between government and religion let me give you an example okay but even all right well let me give you a quick example of just the point i made between uh tying government in with religion when you go into most churches
[05:50] today you will see the altar is three tiers high it's three degrees high it has in most churches they will have a a fence with the gate and only the priest can go through the gate or through the fence
[06:04] up until the altar when the priest uh the clergy comes out he's dressed in a long robe everyone stands out of respect it's the same thing in any courtroom you have the people of the of the of the congregation
[06:18] out here you have the fence with the gate and only the attorneys can go through and speak for you and the bench is three tiers high the three tiers high in the church and courtroom stand for the first three
[06:31] degrees of freemasonry the when the when the uh when the judge comes out he's dressed in the long black robe just as the priest is dressed in a long black robe just as you will be dressed in a long
[06:43] robe when you graduate from university or college the connections are continual the the judge can sit and look down on you for he represents the law spell l-a-w
[06:57] you need to look at where the word law comes from and then of course the the priest can look down on the audience and the people in the church he represents god which is the law so you're saying that
[07:10] people should start looking at in things with a more with a different eye yes than what they in other words people just take it for granted this has always been and this is the way it is absolutely but there is there is an origin
[07:28] for every one of these things gerald massey one of the greatest egyptologists that ever lived wrote that they will find it difficult those who have accepted the authority as truth
[07:41] rather than the truth as authority and so i'm saying that that's what's happened to us as a civilization in the west i'm not interested that much in the east tonight uh i'm more interested in our western
[07:55] way of life and the religion the philosophies that guide our lives the mere fact that in this country in america when you run afoul of the law they say you have broke the law
[08:08] just as moses broke the law and of course the sheriff has a six-pointed badge as the star the star of david or the six-pointed hexagram uh all of our judicial proceedings in
[08:21] court are based on the old common uh common law of england or britannia and incidentally britain is britain or british and brit in hebrew is a contract or a
[08:35] covenant and the word ish means man or men therefore the word british is the covenant men or men of the covenant okay it's a fascinating story when we understand that our government is based on religion and we didn't even know it
[08:50] and i'm saying wake up do your homework okay you they you have such vast such you know a vast amount of information that i have to try and
[09:03] hold you back a minute because i want to get into more things okay i want to say some things here for one thing first let me let me say this how would you classify yourself are you
[09:16] are you religious or are you spiritual are you uh what somebody would say agnostic i mean what what are you i'm a common man an ordinary man
[09:30] in the pursuit of an extraordinary subject i consider myself to be one who appreciates and will fight for truth you are a truth seeker
[09:43] i think that's probably the the best way to determine i am an extremely spiritual person in that i hold very very high spiritual morals ethics
[09:55] i believe in a very powerful spiritual force that dominates and overshadows the world christians call it god others may call it something else but i have a very high respect for spirituality i have no time
[10:09] for religion as such anything that is organized by men quite certainly is not touching god i think that we have a direct connection with our creator with that great spiritual god force in the universe we
[10:24] don't need another man to intervene for us okay so then would you say that um let's say somebody might say well how dare you question the bible i mean how dare you
[10:38] write a book like this you must be a demon or something how would you answer that i would say the same thing has been said of solomon rushdie how dare you question the quran how dare you question uh the karl marx in the and the
[10:52] communist manifesto or mao and the little red book of mao i dare you question authority i'm saying that the man that we read about in the new testament the one called jesus if he
[11:04] taught us nothing it was to question authority because anytime you give away your spirituality and your authority and you do it yourself you know no one comes and hurt and turn and put your hand behind
[11:18] your back and forces you to give up your spirituality and your individual freedom and your right to be a human being and decide for yourself you do that yourself and when you do that and you give up your sovereignty to the government to
[11:32] the church to a religion to a book to a concept to anything you are enslaving yourself all i'm asking the public to do is do a little research see if what i'm saying is wrong and and
[11:46] judge for yourself i'm not advocating i'm not running for a political position i'm not trying to start my own church what i would like to see done as a as a spiritual revolution in this country where people say just
[12:00] say no just say no to organized religion just say no to organized government just say no to tyranny i don't care where it is and what color it is bigotry ignorance ill-informed stupidity just say no from
[12:13] here on out the point i'm making is that you need to do your homework you need to study and find out where things came from what happens what happens when they do find out
[12:26] what happens to those who who their whole life has been the bible there's so many people who have you know the bible is what keeps them going every day what will what will they have to replace the
[12:39] russians in the russia today ask the russians in russia today what is it like when you find out that you've been hoodwinked that your government was not the most powerful the most wonderful government on earth and
[12:53] now it has totally collapsed now what are you going to do you trusted you brought up your children you wasted your entire life and you went along to get along and now what happens your whole world is collapsing around you and why
[13:08] because you didn't do your homework and you didn't stand up for what was right when you could have you went along to get along because it was comfortable at the time and now it's very uncomfortable and i'm saying that that's what we all have to
[13:21] do is look at the uncomfortable facts that nothing is permanently on this earth permanently on this earth let's see they have here
[13:34] um bible model bible models bible morality they have here um who was jehovah and this is thomas thomas jefferson who wrote this who was jehovah a being of
[13:48] terrific character cruel vindictive capricious and unjust then also who was abraham an insane barbarian patriot who married his sister denied his wife who was jacob another
[14:02] patriot who won god's love by deceiving his father cheating his uncle rob and his brother this is bible morality now understand i didn't write that other authors are in the book okay but
[14:17] the point i wish to make one does not need to even read the book one can all all just read the bible and read and put flesh on the things which happen in the this is in the bible
[14:30] this is in the bible are you aware that there were 15. now let me ask you something are you aware that there were 15 other major religions this is history now okay now conjecture
[14:42] history there were 15 major theological religious religious movements in the world before christianity that taught exactly the same identical
[14:56] story of a messiah who came to the earth who was born in a manger who died on the cross who had 12 apostles who died with the crown of thorns are you aware that there were 15 major religions that had
[15:11] the same identical teachings of christianity most people aren't and i'm very suspect of a 16th religion which is copied off of 15 previous religions and i am told that this one is
[15:22] the truth i become very suspect that is that's the way i am as a teacher and as a researcher and a writer i become rather suspect and i tell you something else i'm very suspect and that is the connection between government and politics today in america
[15:38] i think both should be investigated and that's what this book attempts to do look behind the scenes of both our authorities in the world religion politics and money so when that happens people will actually have almost a
[15:52] renaissance of themselves let us hope so and a whole new type of uh person can come back you will agree that that's what we need our country is in trouble our families are in trouble our whole
[16:07] human race is in trouble and basically we can boil it down to three problems we all share on this earth in common religion politics and money and i'm telling you the three are not separate they are all one because in the
[16:22] ancient world the king always represented not only temporal power but also heavenly power he was the connection between the people and god that is why today we have a you cannot get married in this country today in america
[16:36] there is a we are told that there is a division between church and state no such division exists if you want to start a church you must get a 501 c 3 permit from the government you must get permits you must pay the fees you must
[16:50] do all of these legal things with the red tape of government before you can set up a church now once you've set up the church with all the government's permission and permits you cannot get married in this country unless you have a marriage licensed
[17:05] first then you can go to the minister and be married and if your marriage doesn't work out you don't go to god you go to a judge in a courtroom i'm telling you there's something going on here between religion and politics
[17:18] and its money its power and until such time as we're willing to to look at what's been going on in this country for over 200 years and be open-minded because your brain your mind is like a
[17:30] parachute it don't work if it's not open i'm telling we we can be exploited if we're not willing to open our minds open our hearts and say let's look at the facts because the fact is all over the world people are being led by religious
[17:44] leaders ayatollah khamenei and saddam hussein are just two of many people and in this country we we put things on the back of our car support our troops in the middle east you don't even know what they were doing in the middle east
[17:58] do you think that has something to do with politics okay religion and politics do you think that has something to do with this what we call this new world order this global um uh unification that you can bet on you do i think that i can
[18:13] make a very good case of that in a court of law if given an opportunity if you look at the symbols on the back of the one dollar bill the pyramid on the back of the one dollar bill above the pyramid on the back of a one dollar bill look at it you'll see and i know it coeptus i
[18:27] know what collapses in latin means our enterprise is now a success or our project is now a success look at the wording of the on the banner beneath the pyramid novas or dosaklurum no vasa
[18:42] is new order of the world the new world order why is an egyptian pyramid on an american dollar bill are you aware of the symbolism going on here like the washington monument in washington d.c you know what the washington monument
[18:57] stands for it stands for the male erection and it connects right down the waters of life to the oval office the oval is the female the washington monument is the mail it has to do with
[19:10] religion it has to do with sex has to do with it political power and we take these instruments and they we think we take these symbols and we think they're so marvelous do your homework and you'll find out that so much of what we consider to be
[19:24] holy and righteous is in fact nothing more than sex religion and money and most people pretty well know that but no one has actually bothered to confront the establishment
[19:38] i hope to do that i want to confront the establishment for the one reason i think that the truth is an idea whose time has come i think we've all been manipulated and exploited and it's time we look at the real truth that's well i think that
[19:52] a lot of people are somewhat walking around in a daze things are happening they don't they don't know where to turn and they they i think that many of them um
[20:05] they don't really feel very happy with what they receiving in church when they do go to church you know they feel something is wrong it's because something is wrong it's not true the things which we have
[20:17] been told are not true you can prove this in any good library all one has to do is do something you've never done before go to a library and spend all day reading theology and you will find the
[20:31] world has known for thousands of years that these stories are nothing more than stories now um as a matter of fact rita the bible is called the greatest story ever told
[20:45] the greatest story not the greatest collection of facts not the most paramount uh document on earth the greatest story ever told it's a story one must know how to read the symbols
[20:58] and the emblems and the terms and that is why the symbols in the in the bible too are in the bible everywhere i mean did you know for instance that the book of revelation was not written by christians the book of
[21:12] revelation was around for at least 500 years before christianity ever came into existence the book of revelation was already in circulation no john ever wrote the book of revelation his name
[21:25] was ion ion from the ionian sea and when in in in latin when you change eyes to j it becomes j-o-n but in the english it becomes j-o-h-n
[21:39] so today we're told that john wrote the book of revelation no such john ever wrote the book of revelation it was written 500 years before christ was ever born oh this is just just it's just you know it's earth shaking
[21:54] wait till the real truth comes out about religion and politics in america and you're going to see the earth shape are you ready for the tomatoes are you ready i've already gotten it many times okay now in the book um the book your church
[22:08] doesn't want you to read you have an article astro theology yes right and who edited the book with with tim liedem he was our editor tim leedham okay he's the editor of the book and i
[22:21] helped him co-edit it but i also uh did a chapter on astro theology theology and i wanted to say also steve allen yeah also steve allen is a very brilliant writer and he right it's a
[22:33] part of our book now um you you have now we opened up the show with uh thomas paine discussion by him but you also you must like thomas paine because you also have him absolutely incredible okay he wrote
[22:48] um the christian religion is a parody on the worship of the son in which they put a man whom they call christ in the place of the son and pay him the same authorization
[23:02] which was originally paid to the son why did you select thomas paine and tell me more about this oscillator because that is a classic comment about astro theology astro theology is the basis for all
[23:16] religion and the world period astro what does that astral theology theology is the worship of religion theology and astral is the heavens the worship of the heavens
[23:29] from as far back in history as we can go man has always worshipped the heavens that's why we're even told in western civilization that when you die you'll go to heaven and then of course the the interesting
[23:43] point that thomas paine was making is the same one that i continue to make that the whole concept of the sun s-s-o-n god's son goes directly back to the old uh concept

[TIMESTAMPED VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
23:57] of god's son s-u-n being the risen savior because the son is the risen savior it does rise and of course god's son s-u-n uh the egyptians said had an evil
[24:11] brother he was the prince of darkness and he came out at night to rule the world when god's son died and went away the world was in the hands of the prince of darkness and his name was set and he came out at sunset
[24:26] okay today uh even the egyptians the egyptians said that that newborn son that came up every morning his name was horus and they would come out in the temples of karnak and the temple the thieves and and
[24:39] heliopolis egypt and when the sun would come up in the morning as they still do in the islamic faith they would meet in the morning to greet the coming of the new sun we do it in in in easter we have easter sunrise services
[24:56] yes horizon right horus rising that's where we get the word horizon i'm saying that there are 15 major religions in the world before christianity that have taught the same thing it is a very
[25:10] ancient old story that's why the bible is called the greatest story ever told so now i'm not saying there's not good spirituality in the bible i am saying that it has been twisted and used by political powers for a political agenda
[25:25] to keep us ignorant ill-informed and unread depending on the lord to come back to help us when in fact there is no lord coming back to help us education knowledge and your own
[25:38] personal spirituality and investigation of what the story is really about do your homework that's the only salvation we have left um well there's a few questions i wanted to ask you but okay
[25:54] what about there's no adam and eve no the word no adam comes from the word adam no that's why the the hebrews do not have do not take part in christianity
[26:06] uh the jews do not accept jesus as the messiah and many many christians jumping to conclusions say well the jews don't accept jesus that's because they hated the messiah no no such thing as true the reason why jews do not accept
[26:20] christianity is really rather simple they know the story and they know it's just the story it's the gentiles that don't know this what we need to do is wake up and find out that this is a story what is the
[26:35] story telling us now um in our last discussion you were saying that the uh the government which says
[26:48] about separation of church and state but that that is not true i don't believe that the government is very much involved with religion yes yes uh actually if you'll go back to the very beginnings of mankind there's
[27:03] always been this uh coexistence between government and religion between church and state and of course in all the ancient empires the king also was the mediator between god and man so he wasn't just the king
[27:16] of the state he was also the mediator between his people and god uh up until the time of the french revolution that was always the case even in europe uh with the papacy uh today of course we in america like to believe that we have a
[27:30] division between church and state but it is my proposition and my idea that there that no such division exists that the church as we know it today and western civilization is in fact nothing more
[27:43] than a tool and a counterpart to government is that like two hands government and religion both helping the one mind to to do its work and so that's what i am intending to do
[27:58] is to enlighten people as to where government ideas concepts and belief systems have come from and theology and religion and where those ideas have come from and show the connections behind the scenes of how we
[28:11] because we're unread in the field are being manipulated and exploited by government and religion and i think it's an idea whose time has come and you asked me before what kind of a reception i get i get a very powerful uh
[28:26] positive response when i was in new york on abc new york with bob grant i was supposed to do a half hour interview i ended up doing a two hour interview the response was overwhelmingly positive
[28:39] many people in our country know instinctively that there's something going on in big government big business big money and big religion and everyone seems to know that but no one has uh as of yet
[28:53] gone into and brought out all of the facts surrounding religion and government in our country and the monetary and the money connection okay that's what i'm trying to do yes now wouldn't you say that um
[29:11] that that allows in other words if you if if people begin to see what you're saying and i mean our government it's it
[29:24] the guidelines it's it's based upon the moral guidelines is based upon religion right absolutely now if you take away the religion what will happen to the moral guidelines well i i won't have any you see i don't
[29:37] know i'm making the distinction here i'm not talking about spirituality i am a very highly spiritual person i believe in a divine overshadowing in the universe i believe you believe in them absolutely in a divine
[29:51] god or creator i totally am convinced that there is a divine essence to us and and so i have no problem with spirituality what makes you convinced well i'm talking about organized religion no no but what makes you
[30:06] convinced about that that we do have a divine oh i think that there are far too many things that happen to all human beings that we know that there's more to life than just us i think that we've all had too many uh experiences every one of
[30:21] us have had experiences uh some even more so than others right but uh to prove that there is some sort of a spiritual our spiritual dynamics to our life uh i myself have had many
[30:34] experiences in a spiritual way to convince me that i am not here on this earth by myself uh that there are spirits here i believe in a god or a creator i have no problem as i said with spirituality i have a very big
[30:49] problem with government money and religion yes that's something somewhat contaminates the the the beauty of the the divine essence absolutely that is there no doubt about it and they uh we have the best
[31:03] politicians and religious leaders that money can buy and i'm tired of that so can i just ask you something kind of thrown off a little bit um do you believe in reincarnation and what
[31:17] what does the bible say about that and well i believe that i think that you can make a good case for this that in the bible in the old testament and the new uh i believe that there was much in the
[31:28] old and new testament uh to support uh reincarnation but was dropped out and taken out during the middle ages because we know that happened we know many scriptures were were deleted and some things were put in that
[31:44] were not in the original so i think that the the scriptures dealing in both in the old and new testament with reincarnation were taken out purposely because the church felt that that would be uh harmful to the people to think that they come
[31:59] back and they come back again because if you keep coming back before god and and other lifetimes then why do you need to contribute to the church today why do you actually absolutely why do you even need to go to church today or to even hear the priest if you're going to come
[32:13] back the next time and do it over again anyway so i think the church said no none of this we have to take that out and let let everyone believe that they only have one time through and that's it so you have to be in subjection to religion oh so that right there shows
[32:26] the government being involved with the well i mean even in uh european history it's uh our history of europe is filled with the papacy and the pope of rome being involved with the kings and the princes of uh europe and of course that's
[32:40] referred to as the old order of the world the old world order and of course in america we have our religious political foundations and we call ourselves a new world order that's on the dollar bill the back of
[32:53] the dollar bill so there's a lot of connections behind the scenes between major religion big money and government and that's what the book is about the book your church does not want you to read it's just a general anthology on
[33:07] all of the things that are in religion that the churches don't want you to know about now um as we explore this what happens to people as they become more enlightened
[33:24] else will i mean i cannot believe i can't think of of people not ever having a church in their life um church seems to mean so much give so much more i mean how would the church be completely
[33:38] changed would we ever have a church again well i mean did they have churches and then adam and eve's day i mean when when creation first began and the ancient peoples of the ancient world that they have churches you see i'm saying that there's
[33:53] a very big difference between religion which requires a church in the clergy and money and organization as opposed to spirituality within your individual self spiritually between you
[34:06] and your divine creator i don't believe that there is necessity for a church synagogue or whatever i think that the spirituality is between you and your creator so i don't see a need for the church because
[34:20] i think i kind of pick up what you're saying is that you want to bring back the essence and the innocence of people yes and not absolutely have it all of this instruments of um
[34:34] like entertainment entertainment right right and so i see nothing spiritual in in in the church television and church radio i see nothing more than the madison avenue promotion of religion
[34:48] that always and in every way supports government that would be a major uh metamorphosis for people yes if that was to ever happen i think that's going to happen i think that we are being forced uh by
[35:02] events in the world to wake up and and begin to question our foundations and our belief systems uh we expect the arabs to do so we expect the the hindus to examine their foundations and see that
[35:17] they are the need to examine what they believe and it's very good for everyone else in the world to examine what they believe so why isn't it good for us to do the same so now that um
[35:30] freemasonry is that the one is that where symbolism started coming about i mean let me explain why i got into symbolism as you said in the beginning of the program my my mother had an uncle who worked in the
[35:42] vatican secretary of state's office and every few years he would come back to this country and he would sit and talk for days about all the intrigue going on behind the scenes of religion and politics and it was very interesting
[35:56] conversation because and i was just a small child growing up but i would hear him and i would hear this kind of conversation where he would deal with symbols and emblems and secret societies and fraternal orders and the wars and
[36:09] revolutions to show us any symbols well we we don't have that with us tonight but we do have a few slides that we'll get into in a few minutes uh dealing with the foundations of western religion but in relation to the symbols all of these
[36:24] emblems and symbols mean something to us you know on and so many people are unaware i mean the bible has jesus saying many will look with their eyes but not see and that is certainly true people look at symbols all day long and have no idea in the world what they mean
[36:39] and symbols are very important and if you don't think so watch someone wearing a swastika go into a synagogue and watch the reaction that the jews will have when they see the swastika because symbols mean something they have very
[36:52] powerful been wondering about the swastika it's isn't it like a course well it's the hindu originally the swastika from germany was a hindu symbol um and and of course then it
[37:05] it generated down into finally the nazis picked it up like many other nations and other people picked it up too the american indians and then the buddhists have the yes we're going to go to the slides and i think yes if you'd like we can go to the slides i was just going to
[37:20] um i'm just going to make mention about the foundations of western religion oh maybe we're going to do that on part uh the the next show we can well let's go on with this instance we've already introduced the uh the idea of western religion
[37:35] of course we know that the western religion is based on a far older uh bible the bible the old testament uh even further back if you'll go back into the most ancient history of the
[37:48] world in the middle east especially you will see as we will show you now the uh the volcano was one of the many uh things that were worshiped at the ancient world the volcano was very
[38:02] important because it represented a life and creation and it had a sexual connotation that's why today in most men's rooms and hotels or restaurants there will always be a triangle on the door
[38:16] triangle being the the pyramid pyramid comes from the word pyrrha meaning fire and mid meaning middle the fire of sexual generation is in the middle of the human body that's why the volcano always represented sex are they coming
[38:31] of life in the fire of life that brings new life to the world so the volcano was a very important symbol to the ancient people we'll go to the next slide and we will see how now here is the encyclopedia
[38:45] discussion of and let's go to we'll see it says the volcano like any other uh impressive or fearful aspect of nature volcanoes have become the objects of worship
[38:58] for human beings from the earliest stone age yet the original yahweh which is one of the gods of the old testament the original yahweh seems to have begun as a volcano god also
[39:11] mount sinai where moses encountered him as was the seat of the midianite god and in the midianites earliest homeland he was identified with the local moon
[39:24] god sin which is where we get the name for the mountain in uh in the middle east sinai or cyanide comes from the old moon god's sin uh after whom the mountain was named the appearance of yahweh as i said yahweh is
[39:39] one of the old one of the ancient gods of the old testament and the reference work says the appearance of yahweh as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night so that's the way the old testament god
[39:52] yahweh appeared and that was found in exodus 13 21 and 22. now the word volcano and this is important now the word volcano and let's go back to it here it is the word volcano comes from
[40:06] the latin volcano god balkan or volcanoes derived from the occasion deity volcanoes i want to repeat that this is the most important that the word let's go back to the slide because i want to show that
[40:20] that the word volcano comes from the latin volcano god balkan okay let's take the next slide now we're talking about the old volcano god let's go to the next one
[40:33] now here we have the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night we see the israelites in the in the desert and there's the god representation and uh we'll go to the next slide now
[40:48] and see that in the middle here's a reference work on job 38 now on the reference work of job 38 it says thunder is called an hebrew koat or voices for it is considered the voice of god
[41:02] so here we have thunder which is called in hebrew co-op or voices for it is considered the voice of god let's go to the next one uh okay there it is again we're just
[41:15] saying the thunder is voices it's considered the voice of god next one now here in job 38 we will go to the top uh one first in job 38 1 in the footnote it
[41:28] talks about the storm this is the storm the clouds of guard's tent again unless he is gathered as the thunder the voice of yahweh now if you can zoom in on that a little bit we can see that clearer right there
[41:43] so we see that god's tent are gathered as the thunder which is the voice of yahweh roars they descend and god shoots his arrows of his lightning so we're talking about yahweh the god of the old testament with his thunder and his arrows of
[41:58] lightning and then beneath it we'll see on the bottom in hebrew it says god thunders wonderfully we can see the bottom line can we god thunders wonderfully can we see the
[42:10] bottom line yes god thunders wonderfully with his voice okay let's go on so now we see that thunder and lightning is connected to the old volcano god
[42:24] the god of the volcano the next slide here we have and we can zoom in on the a little bit on the bottom we can see that at mount sinai jehovah performed signs the mountain trembled and smoked
[42:39] all over millions now heard and proof that what moses had been known in god's name was actually the word of god now for back off you can see that the israelites are at mount sinai and if you'll back off you'll see that
[42:53] that is uh mount sinai is pictured here in the biblical text as a volcano the next slide now here we have jehovah let's go in and get that a little bit closer so we can
[43:08] see that jehovah led the sons of israel to the mountain named sinai and there he gave them his law now look at the mountain and you will see the mountain at sinai where uh the israelites
[43:21] encounter yahweh jehovah is actually the volcano now let's go again to the next one okay now there we have the uh in the in the uh reference work of the hebrew holidays
[43:36] we have rosh hashanah and uh yom kippur and the next slide the next one we will see is another set of holidays with the passover and now on the bottom
[43:51] we will see that let's bring it in and a little bit closer on the bottom and we'll see one of the holidays is the feast of the giving of the law so here's where moses was given the law from mount sinai now let's go to the
[44:06] next slide and i think we'll have a better picture of that okay we'll back off a little bit there it is now we're seeing that this is the feast of the giving of the law which coincides with the feast of the first fruits
[44:20] let's go to the next picture which will bring that picture up a little closer i think and there we see the volcano again at mount sinai so we're seeing that yahweh the one of
[44:33] the one of the different gods one of the many gods of the old testament is pictured here as the volcano god all right now we go to part two which is the closing part of this section of
[44:45] let's go to the next slide we will see here now the um let's see okay now you'll see here on the torah and the um you'll see the benediction symbol now let's go
[44:59] on let's go to the next one this is the rabbinical benediction symbol that's the blessing the blessing symbol that the uh that the rabbis bless the congregation next one
[45:11] okay now we see the the high priest of israel blessing and you'll see the hands raised in the priestly blessing for yahweh the volcano god or vulcan okay we'll go to the next
[45:26] picture there again in the synagogue in los angeles let's go to the next picture i think we've got a better one and you will see there we go we have the uh the uh the prophet giving the benediction symbol one more now let's go
[45:40] to the next one all right there is the move in on that if we can a little bit you'll see the hands a bit the pentatonic scroll crown with hands raised in the priestly blessing so we see this is a priestly blessing in the
[45:54] hebrew all right now we'll go on one more let's go to the next one here is the rabbi giving the priestly blessing for yahweh at the synagogue and one more which is the last picture will be
[46:07] explaining why mr spock gives the priestly blessing the next picture uh the priestly blessing and that's why mr spock is called a balkan that was the whole idea of the balkan comes from
[46:21] vulcanus or the old christian deity which was later to be found in the old testament under the name of yahweh and that ends the slide presentation so the point i'm making is that when we
[46:34] find the foundations for our religious movements in america and in europe and then we find that from those foundations of the religious movements we have our political movements and so therefore uh what we need to do is understand that

46:48] our religions and our politics are both one and the same and if we're under the law and and have to be a nation under law uh the law is of course the law from the old volcano christian volcano god
[47:01] volcanis the vulcan so i'm saying uh as i said there are two kinds of facts in theology there's the kind you look up in the kind you make up and i'm all i'm saying is that there's been a lot of
[47:13] theology that has been given to us but people need to do their homework because so much that we've been given which is holy comes to find out when you do your homework is not that holy can i ask you one more thing um
[47:27] okay we know all of the symbols and so forth what about this thing that we i'm going to ask you something that a viewer may ask what about the
[47:39] nor and the k and the curse of k kanan yes well it was actually the curse of canaan uh supposedly explains where the black man comes from because he was cursed by god
[47:52] that is that is a horrible misuse of scripture and i think it's too much of a subject to get into now suffice it to say that it was purposely used by people who knew
[48:05] better when they were using it that it was not a curse on the black man that has to do with cana and the canaanites and the curse of the canaanites canaanites were not black people black
[48:18] people were africans not canaanites so um you know we can dispense with that it was misused scripture is that something that we could have another topic yeah that would be a very interesting one when you get into cana
[48:30] and babylon and how today the babylonian empire still rules in our world today our symbols and our emblems come directly from cana and babylon so if there's a curse we're enjoying it right now
[48:44] okay so that's something we can come back and talk about it on that um okay all right so now you don't feel that this is going to when you take this
[49:02] no i think any time i think it is a privilege to educate and help people to understand what like what's going on yeah okay i am absolutely enthralled and i mean i'm
[49:17] you know i feel it's such a treat that you have come to be with us and to share this information with us the secret societies is a very profound subject and it's one that
[49:30] most people just have never even looked at very closely for something that is so powerful and so important in our day the societies which control our country
[49:42] from behind the scenes it's uh it's really important for us to understand how they got here and the symbols which are used symbols occult symbols are like letters of the alphabet
[49:56] put them together and they tell a story but if you can't read the symbols you don't understand the story and so a classic example i'd like to bring to your audience is attention is like on the dollar bill on the back of the one dollar bill everyone's
[50:11] has a one dollar bill in their pocket but very few people have ever looked at the symbolism on the back of a one dollar bill there's much talk going on today in washington about a new world order if we look at the back of the dollar
[50:24] bill the one dollar bill on the left hand side you'll see the magic circle and within that magic circle is the pyramid with the all-seeing eye separated from the body of the pyramid
[50:38] and above the top of the pyramid the uh just above the eye you have anuit coeptus which is latin for i knew it means our enterprise or our project coeptis uh
[50:52] basically means has been crowned with success or is now a success therefore our newest co-op this is our enterprise is now a success now what was that enterprise now that's right now the enterprise itself is beneath the pyramid
[51:05] novas ordo is all latin novas is for new ordo is order and sichlorium is for the secular secular is like your secular job your secular education which means
[51:20] worldly or your the secular world therefore novas or dosaglorum is new world order a term that we hear quite frequently today exactly now the interesting thing about this symbol of the new world order
[51:35] why is it pictured beneath an egyptian pyramid pyramids are in egypt and so there's a reason why egypt has played such a very big part in america america is to the secret societies of
[51:48] the world america is referred to as the new egypt and therefore our symbols are from egypt like in washington dc you have the obelisk of the white house the obelisk is cleopatra's needle known
[52:03] as washington monument the washington monument is nothing more than the egyptian uh cleopatra's needle the as a matter of fact if you fly over washington dc and look down and you have
[52:15] pictures in libraries of washington dc from the air you will see that it is laid out in a tremendous pyramid with the capitol building in the triangle at the top there's the long waterway which is the
[52:29] river styx which is out in front of the cleopatra's needle and of course at the end is the magic circle the masonic circle so it's all has to do with ancient occult secret societies
[52:42] fraternal orders and their symbolism now the question is some viewers may be wondering why the writing why is it in latin and not in uh some african language because that's a very good observation
[52:57] because it is african symbolism but latin language because the um how would you say the the new order was going to be made up of a white society a white elitist society
[53:12] and it would be based on the old mysticism and religion and philosophy of africa but it would be a new africa or a new egypt so you're saying that new societies go all the way back into the
[53:26] yes it goes all the great back right as a matter of fact if you remember the the pyramids are made out of bricks and those who work in the ancient world what bricks will call stone masons and that's of course what we get today the masonic societies or the masons who
[53:41] work with bricks so that almost all freemasons realize that their fraternity of freemasonry goes all the way back into the ancient world into the first dynasties of egypt and all of their symbolism comes from
[53:53] from egypt but what's important is to understand that today in order to understand when the president says the new world order and you hear this term quite often now let me explain to you what's being said
[54:06] when you hear the words new world order america is referred to as the new world christopher columbus discovers the new world well the old world is europe and that and for
[54:20] almost 2 000 years europe has controlled the world europe has dominated the world and rome has dominated europe so for almost 2 000 years rome or the
[54:33] roman church the roman authority of europe uh through their ancient houses their their fraternal houses have controlled europe and europe has dominated the world none of the crusades have anything to do with that
[54:48] absolutely that's exactly right that's why steven spielberg in the george lucas movies with indiana jones and the last crusade because you can't understand the last crusade if you don't understand the first one and it has to do with the lost ark and
[55:02] that's why raiders of the lost ark the ark of covenant and now incidentally in that what raiders of the lost ark where were they looking for the lost ark in jerusalem in palestine in the holy city no in egypt
[55:16] they were looking for the lost ark in egypt because that's exactly where the ark originally was in egypt it was an african symbol it was purely an african symbol the ark and later on it was brought into modern use and
[55:30] in the bible is referred to as the ark of the covenant but actually it comes from egypt it's a much older symbol but anyway if you think about the power base in europe being the old world european the old world and those powers that are behind
[55:45] the throne of europe dominating the world that was an order like the masonic order or an order of priesthood you know the orders of uh you know the fraternal order now as i reflect on history several united
[55:59] states presidents belong to the messiah quite a few as a matter of fact uh the founders of the united states um the uh founders of the country the signers of the constitution were all freemasons except for the few
[56:13] that were secretions and there were a few others that were of other fraternal orders uh in that respect it's interesting to do a little research in your in your history books on an order called the peoria di sayon
[56:25] the holy house of scion s s-i-o-n not z-i-o-n peori d-siom it's a very powerful secret society that's even in existence in the south of
[56:38] france today and that's why of course south of france has always been a very mystical place for occult societies the cathars of course and the albigensian crusades but let me get back to this point about
[56:52] rome dominating europe and europe dominating the world rome the roman church today was the power of europe and that was the old world order the order of the old world but with the coming of america we have a new
[57:07] world order and therefore is the power elite power base which is america the new order are you saying that that power was passed on that's right the
[57:20] power was passed on to them they see that in taking well they actually they actually in fact seized it and took it and and moved the power base from europe to america and therefore the order that
[57:34] now is directing affairs behind the scenes in america is is referred to by people on the inside as the new order the new world order because america is as i said the new world and so when we understand what the
[57:48] symbolism on the dollar bill and it's just an enormous subject getting into the motion pictures hollywood as a men's incidentally the magic practicing priest of the old celtics priest the old babylonian
[58:02] celtic priest of uh of europe had magic wands and the magic wands were always made out of holly wood and that's why because they would work their magic and holly with hollywood
[58:16] and of course the secret societies are still today working their magic with hollywood we use this terminology uh secret societies are they really secret well they they you see those
[58:30] that not all of them are secret many are semi-secret societies uh and the 35 years that i've been interested in this subject i find that there is always going to be many people
[58:44] who have come out of societies for whatever purpose and for whatever reason and begin to devour some of the materials and some of the things that were going on behind the scenes usually we hear about this like 50 to 60 to 100
[58:59] years later someone we finally find out wrote a book or something and then we look back and then we can see why things happen the way they did but today our world is totally in the grips of secret societies the middle east is
[59:13] is dominated by some very powerful secret societies that work on fraternal orders that's the reason why george bush had the uh the troops in the middle east it was to show power to other secret
[59:26] societies so to speak who is actually in control of the middle east i want to ask this question for a viewer that may be out there wondering uh what about the republican and democratic party well george washington
[59:42] i didn't write this i'm just relating it to you george washington mentioned uh in one of his letters uh actually two letters to a reverend in 1794 something like that that
[59:56] the that there was a secret society operating in washington at the time and he referred to it as the democratic societies which was later to become known as the democratic party and he said that this
[01:00:09] society of the democratic society or democratic party was absolutely a very um what was this word subversive movement within the republic and it had as its
[01:00:23] motive it has as its motive the dividing of the people from their government to divide the people from their government so that you would send your your your elected leaders your democratically elected leaders to washington not realizing that those
[01:00:39] elected leaders would be members of secret societies and fraternal orders which would be working in in in concert with the secret societies in washington and you have to understand that
[01:00:50] washington dc is a very powerful spot in the world for secret activities like ross perot yeah well ross perot i mean he's even a newcomer i i go back into uh
[01:01:04] woodrow wilson's day where joe wilson's connections with occult orders and they're called symbols on the dollar bill there's an interesting point about the dollar bill on the right hand side with the eagle of course the eagle is the old
[01:01:17] phoenix symbol of rising from the ashes of destruction coming for the uh from the old roman symbols which even goes back even further than that but uh above the eagle on the right hand side of the dollar bill you'll see 13 stars just
[01:01:31] above the eagle's head 13 stars and there are 13 cloud bursts around the 13 stars there were 13 feathers in the wings there were 13 stripes in the shield on one side there are 13 arrows the
[01:01:45] other side at the bottom there are 13 leaves and 13 berries in the leaves the pyramid on the left hand side has 13 layers now what is very symbolic well it's just the the most important thing is the 13.
[01:01:59] y is 13 so dominating the the dollar bill because 13 is a very powerful mystical number two secret societies because uh incidentally uh our 13 colonies the original colonies
[01:02:14] were uh the reason why we didn't have uh 42 colonies why we have 10 colonies so 127 colonies why do we have 13. now some viewer out there might say well 13 is unlucky number that's right 13 is an unlucky number for you
[01:02:28] that's the point 13 is unlucky for you to use because it's a holy number the 13 is based on jesus and his 12. jesus and his 12 make the 13. the 12 uh
[01:02:41] followers of jesus were called in the bible the cornerstones of the of the new world order the cornerstones jesus is twice referred to in the new testament as the
[01:02:53] chief cornerstone the builders rejected the chief cornerstone the word chief cornerstone of the bible is a greek word means the peak of a pyramid that's what it means so they're the top of a pyramid
[01:03:06] therefore that peak of the pyramid is a chief cornerstone and according to the old occultic understanding of the old kabbalistic understanding of the bible that that pyramid at the top with the eye the eye
[01:03:20] is of course jesus the eye goes back to of course horus which was the son in the ancient egyptian and of course today we have that eye on the dollar bill representing
[01:03:32] jesus or god's son now do you know the person that designed the artist yes the artist that designed uh i'm not sure exactly who designed it originally but that symbol on the dollar bill on the left
[01:03:46] hand side with the pyramid has been in existence just as it is today was in existence in 1774 in bavaria south of germany in bavaria there was an organization a secret
[01:04:01] society a fraternal order uh called the illuminati they used that exact identical symbol you can still see it in the european uh
[01:04:12] libraries and museums the question is how does it end up on an american dollar bill that's the question if it was an old german secret society well that gets into uh some of the fraternal orders that are behind the
[01:04:28] throne in america uh there's such a vast subject uh which leads me up to a question not to cut you off but what is the impact of secret societies
[01:04:41] on american politics today it it absolutely is the heart the blood and the brains behind america today of secret societies the republican party as
[01:04:53] one hand the democratic party is another and the brain is the secret societies behind the scenes very powerful intelligent uh people are at work behind the scenes
[01:05:07] governing both the democratic and the republican party well i was just going to say so in fact in point of fact it doesn't matter who is made president the power
[01:05:20] is always going to be in the hands of the people behind the scenes that's why in america we have a right to elect we love to talk about our right to elect but we don't have a right to see lack
[01:05:34] that is decided upon by those who are in power like today the democratic clinton and the the democratic candidate uh clinton is a member of the uh as a very
[01:05:48] well well-educated man he is a rhodes scholar and if you understand what the rhodes scholarship comes from sessa rhodes cecil rhodes of south africa and cecil rhodes said that he was going to leave his
[01:06:00] millions and millions of dollars to set up a secret society that would be uh teaching young white people young white men to be able to come into power and handle the power
[01:06:14] of a very vast new world government in which the you know and so that was the dream of cecil rhodes to be able to uh to create a secret society that could dominate the world from behind the
[01:06:29] scenes and do it with such expertise that no one should ever even get the knowledge of it no it seems like the winds have changed you hear that statement quite frequently when it comes to politics and and people uprising to
[01:06:42] change governments the secret society have any impact for the situation that's going on in europe absolutely as secret societies have have to do with everything that's going on in the entire world you can you you have to
[01:06:56] know that where there is politics there's money where there's money in politics is religion and there are powerful forces at work right now in yugoslavia there are books written 20 years ago uh talking about how the secret
[01:07:10] societies in the 90s the early 90s were going to break up yugoslavia and they had already designed how they were going to do it who they were going to you know start the war with and how they were going to start it 20 years ago
[01:07:24] books were written about yugoslavia that's just one example and if you in that type of research you can pretty well tell what's coming down the line you can already tell the uh who's going to be doing what if you
[01:07:37] understand the story as i said if you can read the symbols now a question for viewers out there you're not just predicting doom what can the american people do or people that's that want to change what can they do to
[01:07:51] expose these societies well let me say this i am directing my words my work what i do i am directing my my comments and my work only to a select people only to select
[01:08:06] few and that is those who really care about their lives those who really care about the country they live in those who really care about freedom liberty and i believe that the most important thing one can do is to educate your mind
[01:08:22] first because that's where real freedom is is in the intellect spiritual and intellectual freedom and without that kind of freedom and things you don't understand things you don't know
[01:08:35] being not a not being able to read symbols that's where they have you because you don't understand the game that's being played in the world surrounded with symbols and images right and so one needs to take the time to explore right the history of
[01:08:50] these and see what they really mean now a question you're a very noted lecturer you will be doing some events sometime yes as a matter of fact i'm going to be uh doing some radio programs i already have i was in abc new york i
[01:09:03] did a two-hour show there and that was very exciting i just we just did a a program for cbs i was on cbs special on ancient mysteries of the bible
