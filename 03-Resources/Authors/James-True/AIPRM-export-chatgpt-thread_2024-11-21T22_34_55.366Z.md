[05:32] good don't worry I didn't give away I mean you know hello do you know how hard it is to ask mid Journey to render thoughts you have to be thoughtful someone asked
[05:49] me today what are the words that you use James to invoke The Prompt that I see before me today and the answer to you is in the Google Drive that's right ladies and gentlemen if you only had access to the Google
[06:03] Drive Google Drive is a place where dreams come true we're giving away free richer all Tracy found some earlier this morning and I recommend that you guys join patreon so you can be on the Google Drive and if you had access to the Google Drive
[06:16] Believe It or Not we've got an oracle there now it's not online yet but it's getting there it's freaking getting there so you've been asking about that we've decided to add the Oracle to this you would find that inside the Discord Group which you will be automatically
[06:29] added to when you'll become a patreon okay we're doing all kinds of of things here to the Airship uh one of which is uh is uh uh uh mitosis seeing ourselves
[06:43] into a different uh elevation and it's already working um it's already working let me take this moment to uh really interject uh uh something here if you think that your posture and your
[06:58] esoteric understanding could be elevated and that you could gain more compassion through the caloric exercise of your uh morphic compassionate field none of
[07:11] these words are even made up it would it would seem more than appropriate that at the very minimum you would be uh wanting and looking for an opportunity to display this proof to
[07:25] the world and the James True live a dude literally born with the last name true literally just born that way is offering you a synchronistic opportunity to climb aboard a once in a lifetime Airship that you've never seen
[07:39] before and you will never ever see again and you're watching it there on the sidelines for free and I'm telling you why would you not want to see that I'm giving 33 dollars a day to James True live why would you not want to see that
[07:53] you get the Google Drive you get vitriol because you're going to have trouble learning the Google drive when you first start there's a literal embodiment of Athena doing water karate [ __ ] exercises and showing you that there is better posture through
[08:07] witness here you have access to libraries you've never seen there are Easter eggs all over the place there are Miracles dropping from the sky every time we do an Airship and all of that's waiting for you because you believe in
[08:20] your spine enough to subject the currency of 33 into that investment it's not even a pitch I'm I'm seriously asking you how else are you going to level up like
[08:35] how how else is is loving up watching me for free on YouTube is that really leveling up or are you just simply amplifying the fact that your witness is worth nothing
[08:48] aren't you bringing the value of your own witness to me by joining the show you get your name on the screen you're literally running with the spirit of of a girl on the beach who's so freaking Brave that she's embracing the wind and letting some of
[09:02] you try and call her a man by the way and she doesn't [ __ ] care because she's riding the lightning of mystery and and why would you not put fuel into this rocket holy [ __ ] guys why would you not seriously
[09:15] I love you happy Friday let's freaking do this thing right let's do it all right welcome to the underworld ladies and gentlemen what in the world
[09:27] am I talking about what is James talking about and what I'm talking about is the peculiar idea that the Egyptian Book of the Dead when you translate what it was actually called
[09:42] was the book of walking and the light of day it wasn't the Egyptian Book of the Dead it was the book of walking in the live day and I ask you do you think there could be a psychological component
[09:58] that would explain why culture what why why all of Academia some of the most uptight capillaries of esoteric wisdom that you could possibly imagine I want you to picture that Academia is the capillaries of wisdom because you're just going to
[10:13] get the tiniest infused just really really minced pieces of it and that even those guys who are so so strict on well if you'll notice on the etymology then you have no reason to talk about the benderloin meaning of it
[10:27] all and that those people even those people are walking around going yes the Egyptian Book of the Dead it's the Egyptian Book of the Dodd and when you put him in the corner in the parking lot on Level C you're like why are you calling Egyptian boy they're like it's the book of
[10:42] walking live dance book of walking along today you're like okay thank you and then you think you're mean like oh God I'm so mean because I'm intimidating there's this whole other lesson so you go to Airship and then you come back and you realize that in February 20th 2023 the Egyptians Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities
[10:56] released the first photos of a newly discovered text at Sakara just this year we're still finding this stuff just this year look how pristine this is almost his quote quote Book of the Dead
[11:11] but you and I now know it's that's actually not the Book of the Dead what is it again James can you tell me again I I will tell you again let this burn through the pin of raw into the silicone of your brain the
[11:25] potassium that's storing this is the book of walking in the light of day amos's Book of the Dead dated to 300 BC and measured 52 feet in length the irony is stunning I I know what can I say in the 113 chapters the owner's name almost
[11:40] appears 260 times the word Amos means child of the Moon you could call it the book of coming forth by day and really the word book isn't actually accurate it's
[11:58] really spells for going forth by day that we've turned the meaning of spells for going forth by day into the Egyptian Book of the Dead we've
[12:12] literally taken all the magic the spells that we can see and castigated it into the darkness you understand oh that was fitting I actually thought the camera was on but then I was like well actually that that's the dartons good job James think
[12:26] buy me a Coke just don't because it's not actually a real beverage um this is a another Book of the Dead most
[12:43] most Egyptians considered it a uh I'm gonna call it a social construct I'm going to call it that because we we tend to think oh they did it for
[12:58] religious reasons but but religio wasn't even invented yet it it was much more right it was much more Primal then it's much more Primal and these these books were keys they were they were the spouse used to
[13:12] go forth by day by day back then these were they were called what are you doing today I'm working on my spell book that I use during the day and they're like how fitting it's they're literally the day right now he's like I know that's the best time to see
[13:26] the sun's out I mean I mean the raw's out and I can and I can see well you better wear some suntan lotion yeah I know I've got some crocodile semen over here I'd like to make sure that everything's okay
[13:40] in the opening scene almost is worshiping the idol of Osiris and Osiris is placed inside a booth this the symbol is the the word for rest and it actually goes deeper
[13:53] than the meaning of rest um let me I hate to skip ahead but I think actually I wanted to tell you this first and and if you can't see this on the screen these are uh one two three four
[14:10] uh five um five symbols that basically uh phonetically spell out creased and that when you wish someone to Merry Christmas you were speaking Egyptian you were telling them ever have a merry
[14:27] burial happy burial to you I want you to enjoy your burial enjoy your rest is what they're saying enjoy your rest and so
[14:43] most of these books of the Dead I say most because I haven't looked at all of them but every one of them it definitely every one of them features Osiris and typically it's it's the beginning why because this is the beginning
[14:57] of your book of walking by day and so now you you understand why they call it the Book of the Dead because the the beginning of the book begins with the death the very first
[15:11] thing that happens in the book is Osiris dies and this is my friends this is some
[15:22] profound profound things profound because this gives you a this this pours all the truth into the room at once and thank God for mythology
[15:36] because the academics couldn't mess it up because they had to just preserve what it said and thank goodness they encapsulated in a folder called Mythos and that Mythos was treated sacred
[15:51] and so all of these social Fashions weren't allowed to erode it some of them did which I'm about to show you although we might not get to it today but it's a yeah we'll just drive the car James
[16:05] drive the car now Adam and Eve and Osiris have the same thing Adam and Eve and Osiris went through the same thing the story of Osiris is is
[16:19] that is that he was at a wedding party and his brother Seth said oh great Osiris I made you a beautiful beautiful box and actually oh oh oh oh brother forgive me let me start over oh brother
[16:33] on your on your wonderful birthday I constructed this beautiful box and there's only one person here in the room out of all of you there's only one that would fit perfectly and so I ask each of you to take the opportunity to celebrate this beautiful
[16:48] Box by by seeing if you would fit and everyone at the party tried to fit but no one would fit except Osiris he he fit perfectly without chemically in sync
[17:03] it was as if Osiris was following the star on his way into a village we'll call it uh Bethlehem yeah they they got together and they were like this is our village
[17:18] now right and and through this this sinking he he knew what the Romans were going to do Osiris knew because Osiris was King how do you get to be king you know [ __ ] yeah no things
[17:32] and at the very beginning of his life The Story Goes that Osiris was deceived and it's the same same story that happens at the beginning of Adam and Eve that they were deceived and what does deceived really mean
[17:46] does deceived actually mean to be lied to or does deceived actually mean to be separated from that which you perceive and when we look at the root of
[17:59] perceived we decide that perceive perceive is more akin to becoming aware of or cautious of something and so to deceive would also mean or
[18:12] even etymologically a closer definition to what it means would be the pulling away from or out of consciousness therefore Adam and Eve were deceived
[18:30] Osiris was deceived and neither of them were tricked do you understand neither of them had this beautiful beautiful victimhood complex that we have where we can actually invent the
[18:43] word I was deceived if you think about what the word deceived means it is it is covered in the stickiest victimhood you can imagine it creates a world in which
[18:59] um you have zero control over your perception and that you have zero control over Discerning your environment and that something else outside of you is now allowed to take blame or responsibility
[19:13] for your own power to be deceived is to vent it is to shed power and that's a definition that you and I have been raised in but thank goodness
[19:26] for etymology we can go back and see what it really means Osiris was deceived Eve was deceived they removed what they knew before
[19:42] if people spent their whole life fearing death can we be sure those people would be willing to accept it once it came every book
[20:00] and the show begins with a dad and that death is the light of day and the story of Osiris is a story of being divided into how many cells are in
[20:14] the body again 30 trillion pieces Osiris is divided into 30 trillion pieces and each of them begin to walk in the light of day
[20:31] and they begin only because Osiris was deceived he was gutted and removed of his consciousness
[20:45] and split into tiny tiny pieces and you and I are those pieces today and so maybe this is the underworld and maybe you and I are here measuring
[21:04] our own hearts in real time and only on our death bed well some of us have enough compassion to wash away the angst and we'll finally see that everyone in our life
[21:18] is an innocent child this River of time that you and I are on right now this barge that you and I Proclaim as the Overworld is the underworld
[21:34] and we tell ourselves that this judgment is coming later not now we are insisting that this is not happening every moment
[21:49] right now whoops I woke up to this once when I say this I don't actually mean this particular place this is actually a rendering I could tell James because it's really cold because I can feel how
[22:06] art is cold and even though that's an emotion I'm still saying that a machine cannot insert an emotion even though it's making me feel an emotion right now by hating it so much oh my God James you just made my soul explode because you just see me oh I'm gonna need to come to
[22:19] Airship and join right now holy [ __ ] oh 33 33 I woke up to this one seriously I I was in Georgia uh near the uh George guystones actually and I was camping by a river I pulled in really late it was like three three in
[22:33] the morning I didn't actually realize how pristine I had landed and I I just I took my my pad out and just threw it right on the ground in front of my car and just just slept and I when I woke up I saw this
[22:47] and when I see this I want you to to to see the mirroring of the lake if you're listening on the podcast it's just a a leg that has a mirror or where the mountains are both in the water now the water and and if you can imagine yourself waking up uh laying down
[23:01] then you can see what I see you would see a world that is actually horizontal and it's split it's split in two there's a hemisphere my beautiful beautiful brains
[23:15] the hemisphere is right there this whole world is reflecting both sides and for a moment I remembered who who I was I remember that that I was born upside down I'm sorry that I was grown from the from the Tree of my mother
[23:29] upside down and only in the in the third trimester prune my lips if I'm wrong but only in the third trimester did I side I'm going to flip over I'm going to decide this is now right side up and neither one of them
[23:43] were real because when I woke up one morning in Overton Georgia I saw this and I understood I was the one that was assigning good and evil to the world I was the one that deciding that this is the one that I'm
[23:59] going to call up and this is the one I'm going to call down and there will be no in between and I clung to gravity and I clung to my ideals as I cling to them now only now I'm having more fun I'm doing nothing
[24:14] differently esoteric is not an action esoteric is a dilation it's a drinking birth Shall We Begin is everybody having a
[24:30] good time everything good birth I want to start by talking briefly about the Baphomet I'm going to urge you all to buy the book Arc of Baphomet by James true that dude freaking Nails it it's available on audio right now and uh yeah if you were in Google Drive
[24:51] at a certain level you might freaking find a copy but I'm not saying that because mystery is is abounding but seriously I do need you to consider I do not have time to put all this in here there's a book that really Nails this but you're looking to Baphomet
[25:05] and before I explain this I need you you uh wonderful people to hear that I do not think that Egyptian culture used to know things I do not think that there are secrets that that were left over from older civilizations that were preserved in a room although that is
[25:19] possible I do not think that that explains what I'm showing you I am trying to tell you that the mandala sonar that we've been talking about and now that I've cleared the room of of objectivists and
[25:33] majoritarians I can now get to the Crux of what's really real and and truly truly what's happening is is that the entire esoteric truth of this entire place has to be
[25:46] somewhere and that place has to be somewhere in everyone's mind at the same time or else it wouldn't be a universal truth which gives you a giant clue that you can go back through history and simply understand what were Universal
[25:59] terms and you're looking directly directly at a stud wall do you understand this is a load-bearing wall because everyone knows it and when you go to Egypt you are not looking at a
[26:13] high time that once existed you were looking at the truth in the room rendered somewhere where you're not going to freak out about it it has to be there and thank God for Mythos because it's
[26:28] this milky substance that we who freak out over truth and all of us do have used to cover our eyes to insist we're safe from it and we're clever that way we've brandished the truth and
[26:41] castigated it into a prison of six thousand years ago right and it's here but it's not touching us because we're calling it Disney that's why we have Disney we're like we hate Disney you don't hate Disney
[26:56] if you didn't have Disney all these people that know that magic is real would be cannibalistic Wizards and they and they'd insist that that it wasn't them and they'd be setting people on fire with their own psychic Force this entire time and they'd insist it wasn't them
[27:10] and that that is still happening now but thank God we have something like Disney that's able to short out those man bear pigs and that's why people are so mad about Disney or people love Disney it's because you're looking at the electricity this is how it works you
[27:25] know this you know this and that in the history there is this figure of Baphomet this is the Greenfield Papyrus it's not 52 feet ladies and gentlemen this is 121 feet
[27:36] found in 1880 and then in 1880 this this figure is holding up the sky but more importantly it's creating the
[27:48] separation between the womb that is above so below there's now a new space that's formed in this new space what you're looking at when you when you understand these things and if you read my book you already know you're already there you're already vibing you're already sailing
[28:03] down the sea you know holy [ __ ] James there's the chimeric twins that you talked about thank you and what are they doing they're separating The Waters from the waters they're creating the very first creation
[28:16] of air itself and that's what happens at your seed that the zygote does this very same thing and that the truth of that would have to be somewhere and where do we put it we put it into our mythology we put it as far back to the timeline as we can
[28:32] remember do you see the resonance if you do do you see the resonance that the very very first memory that you have would be the very very oldest civilization that we can remember can you see how those would need to line up of course you do you see it I don't even
[28:48] need an almond raw I don't think any of you guys ever even type it when I ask for it that's fine but that entire process is here not because the Egyptians had a secret they were hoarding it from you and they're going to cut your your kid's dick off if you don't do this and that you have to do that and you're supposed to be afraid
[29:03] of synchronicity you realize that the people that are freaking out about the symbolism are the ones that are afraid of synchronicity do you know why because Disney's not working it's not pulling in enough of their man bear pigments that the truth of the world is never ever going to come to you through the
[29:18] capillary of an epidemic you're going to want to sink your teeth right into the artery and just you're going to even the vein do you realize how much wisdom is in the vein you tap the veins you see how much
