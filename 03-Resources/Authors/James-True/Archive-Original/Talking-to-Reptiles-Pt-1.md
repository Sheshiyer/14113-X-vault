[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] [Music] yeah okay so so the last two sessions we've been focusing on this idea really important one that there is a threshold A Line in the
[00:12] Sand and to explain this threshold I'm using the term fireworks there's a place there's a threshold where fireworks are bad below a certain line and fireworks
[00:25] are good above a certain line and truly this line is separating this reptile so the cold blood is the reptile cold blooded energy conservation you
[00:38] your thinking set your computer Matrix is the same temperature as outside you do not have the same stability to your clock chip speed your ability to process information is going
[00:53] to go from very very very very slow in the winter to very very very fast in the summer you're going to notice that you're just not going to be able to build a lot of tool sets that you could
[01:06] build on a Mamon platform on a mammal OS particularly because the coldblooded versus the warm-blooded just offer certain advantages there's a concept
[01:18] called an air cooled engine very similar here if the aircooled engine does not remain in motion if you're idling an air cool engine say on the streets of Kansas City and you hit rush hour traffic your
[01:33] engine will cease because you are not moving enough air through the system which means to have a coldblooded engine such as an air cooled engine you would be turning the engine off all the time
[01:46] there's no such thing as Idle you cannot afford something as fancy as Idol and the same concept would carry forward in your brain in The Reptilian Brain versus your brain the there is a
[02:00] limit a dotted line which below this line fireworks bad versus fireworks good and as we learned last time you already know this you know that pain
[02:14] information all of these things tax the cold-blooded mind in a very big way so much so that the reptile would literally ignore taxing information as much as
[02:28] possible that there m desire is to dismiss and reject new information because they cannot afford the luxury of tuning in so you enter what we call the reptile Loop right which is is this
[02:43] novel what's new in the room is the first thing the reptile asks what's new here the second thing it asks is if something new here comes the logic gate if something new is it
[02:56] threat the third gate if something new and it's not threat is it food these three things are the entire entire reptile Dimension and so you could see very
[03:11] easily from this standpoint that fireworks would be bad bad the information it gives serves the reptile of none all it does is stress it out and
[03:23] cost it valuable calories that its need needs but on the other side of this scale to bring Libra in you have this mammal who says fire
[03:37] works good fire works good and you start to see there's a very fundamental difference between these two creatures and one of it has to do with
[03:51] how they would see fireworks so when I tell you that fireworks is good I want you to understand even deeper that all all mammals all mammals consider pay a kind
[04:04] of food all mammals gawk you gawk I gawk it's called rubbernecking we will see pain on the side of the road and we will look we will stop and look we will put ourselves
[04:18] in danger to gawk at pain as we pass it on the road why why is that and the answer is because fireworks good
[04:30] our minds our brains are tuned to consider pain as a valuable resource while reptiles say pain bad run from pain pain not good mammals are more like
[04:44] pain pain bad me understand pain to avoid pain in future so man will stay in pain even utilize pain if he develops enough neocortex he actually starts to
[04:58] create it as a tool so it's a very very different reaction to to this state the mammal when it sees pain that
[05:10] others experience will burn valuable calories will create plasma to build a scenario in their mind where they can relive or fantasize what it would be like to have
[05:27] that pain too this is profound if you think about it why are you fantasizing about what it's like to be
[05:38] smacked by a truck and be inside the cab as it's crumbled into this tiny tiny shape why is that fascinating to you and the answer lies in this very
[05:53] very minor distinction between fireworks good fireworks bad we consider painn nois we're able to extrapolate from others pain we're able to extrapolate build the plasma inside live that pain
[06:08] and then avoid it before it even happens but it did happen because we live that Pain by creating it our in our mind we created something that was not there and
[06:21] that thing that we created that was not there literally caused us harm our neurons reflected a harmful State and this is not an exaggeration I can show
[06:35] you a video of a dimly lit room and your pace your breath your physiological response
[06:47] will mimic what you felt in a dimly lit room the day before I can inject a certain regulatory State inside of you
[07:00] specifically because you quite unconsciously will stalk and find pain in the room you will look in the restaurant and you will say out of all the tables here
[07:14] I do not want to sit next to the bathroom I do not want to sit right next to the door that opens into the kitchen you know these things because you've experienced the pain of sitting there in
[07:28] your mind and that pain that you live through is guiding you in the future and you are a successful man a successful woman a successful person if you can create this
[07:42] pain in the most magical effective way possible and accurately uh deduce what action would serve you well
[07:53] this is like top tier dating tips here you can Master these things you will master your business life your home life your relationship literally every single thing you do is going to come down to
[08:06] how you manage these pra economies that you find yourself in or that you find yourself desperately trying to avoid most of us don't avoid them now because we've been warm-blooded for a while and
[08:19] so we've entered into this relationship with pain and we understand this is uh this is a better way to go to about it this way so you
[08:31] see a massive difference in these fireworks one's good one's bad and if you're going to be dealing with a reptile brain I need you to understand the dichotomy and every time you deal with someone you're going to be dealing with
[08:46] a reptile brain and after tonight I think you're going to be able to actually determine when your reptile brain is speaking because it can speak can say words
[09:00] and when it's not and the more the closer you get to trying to understand the difference I think the closer you'll see to seeing this in others too when we hear the phrase I don't understand you
[09:14] fundamentally what we're really saying is I can't predict you I can't predict you is what I mean when I say I don't understand you at all it means I got no idea what you're going to do next I don't know what you're going to say next I don't know what
[09:27] you're going to think next I can predict you I cannot understand you neurologically speaking there are seven layers of understanding Gnostic speaking your neurons have these different layers of
[09:42] depth that they're planted in the soil and that some of those neurons will fire from a very very deep place in the epidermis of the folds of your brain you
[09:54] understand something deeply and profoundly probably because the neurons that it's activating are so deeply sunk into this skin so we have this uh
[10:08] metaphor because the Oracle mythology is always telling you the truth about what things are and what things are not and so you truly understand that neurons are
[10:18] this living living idea embodied in this spark broken down into this little transistor we call it neuron but something I want us to talk about that we're not going to be able to
[10:36] touch is a very important concept that I think most of the world doesn't even consider a word yet and it's qualia qua l i a it is the phenomenal character of an
[10:49] experience an event will have qualia because it leaves a certain footprint or Ingram on your mind we've gotten so accurate at mapping the brain believe it or not using a rabies
[11:03] virus uh but we've gotten so accurate at mapping the brain that we can determine a neuron per neuron what fires when why and how and it turns out that experience creates different ingrams in
[11:18] our mind constellations different regions or more it's more specific to say different patterns that will light up in certain places in our mind and when these different patterns are lit up on top of
[11:32] each other through a multi-threaded experience for example you have to go to the bathroom but you're on the most beautiful sunset Cruise you've ever been on in your entire life you're with the
[11:46] the woman that you love and you're having the worst fight you could ever imagine these are four different ingrams that when they're laid on top of each other create this completely different experience although technically all four
[11:59] of these ingrams you felt separately before and it is because you felt these ingrams separately before which is why you're seeking this new experience now because you're under the impression that
[12:12] if you lay these ingrams out just right in front of the camera the raw the sun itself and expose your neurons to a new experience that has the perfect
[12:27] Sunset the perfect love of your life and you're not fighting and she's ovulating or you're ovulating and it's the perfect time it's the birthday and all the planets are aligned and that those very same events
[12:40] would cause these new engrams to form and that those new engrams are so powerful they burn so much brighter because of koalia that they rewrite your past
[12:53] immediately and the last time you had an Ingram that had this sour note it's been obliterated it's been completely destroyed by this new memory that you're laying out right now and what determines
[13:07] whether or not that old memory is destroyed is really comes down to the qualia of the Ingram the footprint that this Ingram had in your mind so there are constellations there
[13:21] are elves we call them environmental Electro Electro look it up Electro phenomenon elves Sprites elves these little little packets of things
[13:36] that that occur above thunderstorms and they look just like neurons because you were living in this body of Osiris and all these thoughts and all these memories you have are going to be lighting up this plasma that exists in your Atlas above your
[13:50] head all these things every single thing that you've ever had done or experienced in this life profound has been broken down to ingrams stars that twinkle in your mind
[14:04] at exactly the right time every single thing you've experienced can be broken down is that so even what reality is itself we have
[14:19] this secret room this chamber this Thalamus where the four in of reality occurs and it's not occurring through a physical space it's occurring through a
[14:33] constellation being lit up in a certain pattern and that pattern giving us meaning and that meaning allowing us to apply sentimentality to it the I'm telling you these things because the things that I'm talking about are not
[14:47] tangible none of these things are tangible all of these things are pointing to this higher higher chemical and that chemical is called qualia it's the intrinsic consciously accessible
[14:59] features that are extra sensory to your inventory I mentioned the other day quite crudely the idea of eating a cantaloupe with your face of just shoving your face deep into into the meat of that cantaloupe and just
[15:14] becoming the essence of of pulling that thing through the pores of your gums and just sucking every last drop there's something about this
[15:27] experience that takes you beyond the sensations of it all and you become something else the qualia gives you wings and you cease to be planted here
[15:42] you become this new reality a new universe and the reason why it's a new universe is precisely because the Charisma of the event is so strong that you forge that reality on the spot this
[15:56] is what most of our reactions truly are this is why I I want it was so helpful that we began by saying logic isn't really what we think it is demonstrating the fear of
[16:11] God I think is a really good uh example of guia the fear of God is not necessarily
[16:25] clean we don't fear God in the same way that we might fear black Bart the The Outlaw or God forbid [ __ ] comes in to town to
[16:38] Rockridge fearing God is a quality of how much God intimidates you inside
[16:50] meaning the fear of God is the qualia of consequences very important thing that we we take for granted there was a time when you would
[17:05] meet people in town and you didn't know if they were suffering consequences you didn't know if these people were susceptible to consequences you know these people now a lot of these people don't have Neo cortex
[17:20] yet so anytime you're dealing with someone under 28 chances are they probably don't really have a qualia in in line yet with consequences they just not there yet they're working on it and
[17:34] certainly our neocortex develops as it starts to develop as young as 11 so I'm not saying you'll never see these but I'm saying it's it's almost unfair to make this assumption that everyone even has this skill this magical skill to uh
[17:49] insert consequences into their engrams that happens because you have this outer lobe this neocortex that's covered up up it's covered the high brain completely it's stopping it from
[18:02] seeing the world and it's overriding every decision with a B okay I'll allow I'll allow I'll allow it removes the immediacy from the reptile's brain and creates this future
[18:16] time machine as we spoke about for the sole purpose of writing in grams you see your hind brain is Resto is storing the ingrams of fire bad fire burn fire fire
[18:28] danger me no like fire fire evil force that kill Village this this this is beautiful Theory like this you don't burn your hands anymore this like greatest thought you've ever had just
[18:42] like I'm [ __ ] genius Z Zog no like fire and something happens to Z one day starts to Leverage The Heat he starts to leverage what he could do with the uncomfortableness of touching that
[18:58] fire what kind of things could he do if he could just endure the pain of that fire a little bit longer and so you end up with this neocortex this ability to write ingrams
[19:10] on top of ingrams so the pain Ingram is still there but there's an Ingram on top of it which meant success pain equals success because the engrams lay on top of each
[19:23] other we live in this multi-dimensional stamped world I I flip out over about this all the time I know if you had a dollar for every time you've heard James say this but it is freaking fascinating that we have a medium of sound and a medium of light and a medium of wind and
[19:37] a medium of vibe and a medium of music and a medium of smell and heat and passion and anger and angst and paranoia all of these fields can exist in the same [ __ ] room in the same room they
[19:51] don't even disagree you could be in that room and you can experience all these things at the same time why because you're ingrain are encoding each thing separately your limic field your limic Consciousness is
[20:05] recording the constellations as an antiquarian would meaning they're not putting judgments on them think God they're just recording exactly what happened knowing knowing that you will
[20:18] hallucinate everything in your recall is your creative Spirit to have the worst idea you've ever imagined or come up with the most brilliant use of fire that anyone's ever
[20:31] seen before these are two firework good firework bad and they're working together in tandem they are symbiotic that's
[20:45] a that's a you think The Odd Couple right that's it's a tricky couple the fact that they could even work together this long is pretty astounding and that only occurs through a lot of ignorance through a lot of
[21:01] ignorance we have about about uh about how this actually works or more importantly about who's actually in charge so quala is something that all of you have been seeking you seek the quality of a
[21:15] moment you seek the quality of the leverage that you get from your being in your Zone from doing what you want to do for a living from spending time with the people that are important to you all these things are really just giving you
[21:30] this base commodity that you're here for is to have qualia and and I say base commodity after you've reached this level some people don't even know what qua is most of our generation that brought us here doesn't know this
[21:44] word they never even thought about it they never once considered that two people can be in the same room and have uniquely different qualia drinking a different kind of of
[21:58] nectar from the same Cup right it's the same cup and this is why it's been so hard I think for us to to recognize this very very real thing you would die I think
[22:13] most of you were hip enough that you know this you would die if your quality wasn't wasn't good enough you would off yourself you would find a mundanity to be so stale and so stagnant that you just affixiated on it and you would just
[22:27] naturally come up with a creative way to off yourself quite by accident I'm sure you'd be like oh what an accident but you'd starve because you you you don't have the qualia that you need to
[22:40] survive if a synapse fires in the forest but no one was there to feel it is there [Music] pain I ask you this because the perfect way to understand or approach this idea
[22:54] of qualia is to consider that dogs are not alone in what I'm about to say it just happens to be this is a picture from a drawing from a a dog's foot but the idea is is that there are certain
[23:07] pieces and parts to the reflexology inside your body and a dog's too that uh a dog can step on a uh attack and that that pain is very real
[23:22] it's very much there probably more so than anything else but it's not wired to the brain it turns out the body's like yeah there's we don't need to tell the brain that this hurts we don't need to do that we don't we're going to we're going to
[23:37] have a just different reaction that's all and so you end up with a relay neuron inside a synapse that's just based right there the backbone why waste the time why waste the wiring to go all the way up to inform the owner that
[23:50] there's pain here you have the same thing you and me both do when I wrote Quantum rapture took me a while to find it but there's a
[24:01] spot inside your right there a little pocket and that pocket has no no sense organs at all you could you could stick a pen right right through your thumb
[24:15] right there just like stick it in there and you wouldn't feel a thing you could have an implant inside your hand right there you wouldn't know it's there you could pull it in and out in and out in and out you wouldn't know you wouldn't feel it why because you're not wired
[24:30] with a sensor all these things are sensors and all these sensors are wired into a lyic system but not every single s uh sensor actually makes it to the
[24:43] computer so philosophical question for you does the dog feel pain I I don't I don't think there's a particular particular answer I'm not
[24:58] trying to sell you my Charisma is not in this fight I want you to consider that because I think wherever you end up on that motorcycle really starts to reshape and paint the rest of your reality as you start to realize if you do not
[25:13] experience pain is their pain is their pain if you do not experience data is their data right this qualia
[25:29] is built into the answer the quaa quaa is not a feeling of this feels good Ka is a feeling of this feels feel this feels so feel I've never felt
[25:45] the feel of so much feel before that this is some deep feel it it will leave an Ingram on me for a long long long time now I want you
[26:00] to think about what kind of reaction what kind of experience would leave an Ingram that would last longer than other experiences easy right out of the gate
[26:15] it's easy to say well something very painful it's a good answer right if you were to experience pain that you never felt before the engram would be so much stronger that that neuron would persist
[26:28] longer than anything else one of the reasons why it would persist is check it out remember our friend reptile novelty that's the very first reason why it would persist is because it's
[26:40] new you have an opportunity to write a stronger mark on the on the thoughtful record of any Ingram if it's the very first time you've ever fired to this
[26:53] neuron quisi WOIO boom I just someone just went purple in their head they're like oh my God James is aipi poio I've never had that neuron lit before that's pretty freaking
[27:05] cool and it sadly it doesn't quite work that way because Quito doesn't actually work yet because it's not a constellation that's been burned into your ingrams yet because you
[27:18] just heard it all I did was inserted into your short-term Loop your phonological Loop is constantly saying everything that I say to you it has no choice but to repeat it it just does it repeats it because it's
[27:32] waiting for your neocortex to say wait a minute wait a minute that banana truck that just drove by hang on a second and it's because you have that phonological Loop you have the neurons
[27:47] constantly saying what what what was it quiz of I don't remember why do you not remember because we did not tag it we did not send that to Ingram land we not say this is crucial some of you have photographic memories and [ __ ] you
[28:01] you're bizarre as [ __ ] because you you remember all that stuff but I I don't like you go away but the rest of us we we have this ability where we have to find an excuse to regurgitate or more importantly we have to find an excuse to burn the
[28:14] Ingram this is why learning in the morning for a teenager is like the worst possible idea you could ever imagine this is why learning stationary is horrible this is why therapy on a couch
[28:26] in a room is horrible moving your fingers while you're burning ingrams is one of the most effective ways to store information something even more powerful
[28:40] is to engage it with a face because the facial neuron net is so much more vast so motor cortex cerebellum right by moving my fingers
[28:56] I'm engaging the oldest wisdom you've ever known which is how to use my fingers and the face is using all of your ventral your newest neurons so the
[29:09] face and hands used together would give you a better opportunity to store or score an Ingram so sports physical combat right all of
[29:23] these things would be obvious to have a oneup ship on storing ingrams just right off the bat watching two people play chess probably not gonna get as many

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
29:37] ingrams probably not gonna happen right now you know why we have costumes now you know why there's Showmanship because that's how you burn ingrams and you're only going to remember the ingrams that's what you're going to
[29:51] remember it's like literally true you're you're only going to remember the in because literally that's all you are when we get into this ID versus ego there's an ID and the ID talks for you
[30:05] all the time two plus two your ID just said that your ID just told you four that was your ID that wasn't your neocortex that wasn't anything mammal about you that was this
[30:20] motor slave that just four four it's four it's four you've heard that so many times the Ingram's been imbued in you for so long
[30:34] that you decided that you would give it a front row ticket right in your cerebellum and you're like this is the answer there's no there's not even logic to it it's just pure regurgitation just
[30:46] like just like this just like this this is regurgitation pen and paw send to sensory neuron sensory neuron says we don't need to tell the brain
[31:01] just we'll just send it right back and send a motor neuron and have a muscle twitch that's all we'll just twitch we don't need to tell the brain we'll just twitch no Quia at all
[31:14] none this is a life-changing event but not for the dog because there's no quaia it didn't happen ladies and gentlemen it did not happen which is weird because you saw it happen you literally saw
[31:28] it logic gates here they are Cameron here's an MPN transistor it receives a signal from B and decides the signal from C through to e and there's a p and p transistor which
[31:42] basically does the opposite it waits for a signal uh from B and then if e comes in sends it to C so these two transistors are just neurons and when you look at at the
[31:55] human body you have 100 135 billion transistors inside your body and if you broke this down guess what there's four there's
[32:09] four unipolar neuron multipolar bipolar pseudo nonpolar neuron and by the way we don't even have unipolar neurons those are in Plants humans don't even have those but when you literally think about every single thing that gives you qualia
[32:25] Consciousness everything it's going to be br broken down into one of these logic gates one of these circuits when you count how many is in each system right your central nervous system has majority of your neurons your
[32:38] peripheral nervous system has you know a lot but not nearly as as many 15 billion like 10 10 times the amount in your central nervous system but but if you if you start to break down which neurons do what are they specialized in
[32:54] you start to see uh an interesting hierarchy form so the heart has roughly 40,000 the retina 200,000 the spine 69 million the gut 500 million neurons in
[33:07] your gut it's a very intelligent being controlling your gut and then your brain at 100 billion and if you break those numbers down and you let's take this idea of the body of
[33:21] Osiris then I'd like you to think about one of those heart neurons would be like the queen of your body body and for every Queen there would be five Council five people that were seers in
[33:36] her Court this is your retino neurons right these seers are here to foresee all things that might happen to the kingdom good or bad and then underneath this in their spine you have this just like the dog
[33:50] you have this regimented Army of neurons that are that are there to reflexively act to defend and protect protect their Queen and then inside your gut you have
[34:02] this beautiful Court you have the Moguls the superstars the fashion icons why why do I call them that because they are the your gut they they control your the serotonin that they're going to release
[34:16] into culture through the grooves and appetites that they set so the gut is is the movers and the Shakers of your land they're setting the pace for for what the appetite will be
[34:30] and how the seasons change these paces and then maybe you would say at the bottom of this totem pole so to speak or the bottom of this pyramid you have two and a half million people the neurons in your brain each
[34:44] living a private experience each being dictated uh through the laws of the land uh decrees from the Queen the council the Army and the court all of them
[34:57] showing this uh blue collar brain cell how this how this giant giant World works and every one of these people is contributing to a qual qualic I'm making
[35:11] this word up qualic experience and that experience is only had when everyone shares when everyone has it at the same time or together when you really break down what
[35:26] Consciousness is and and we're not even going to talk about Consciousness tonight because it's it's kind of a too big of a topic but but if you really want to break down what what life is how how much qualia you could pull a really good way to do that would
[35:40] be to look at just the sheer neuron count and pound per pound elephants have a lot more neurons two and a half times maybe three times more than humans do now science is going to tell you but humans have more in their cerebral
[35:55] cortex but as you're about to find out this actually doesn't really matter when it comes to emotional intelligence turns out a dolphin can understand complex
[36:09] sentences could tell them the difference between put the right ball in the left basket or put the left ball in the right basket like it it understands the difference between these things both orcas and chimpanzees can
[36:22] recognize themselves in a mirror but Jim can only do this as an adult about 50% of them manag to do it after more than 100 trials so through practice and practice the chimpanzee can develop
[36:35] this but the Orca has the skill from day one human beings do not have this skill from day one roughly two years old is the average
[36:47] when a when a a young human can recognize themselves in the mirror but the orc has been doing that from the very beginning this
[37:02] uh this idea of who's at the top we're in this neoy Dark Age right now where frankly we just cannot admit
[37:16] that we're not the most emotionally intelligent creature on this on this planet not even close guys look at this on the left is an orca brain on the right is a human
[37:32] brain and and this isn't just uh pure raw brain power we're talking about the the folds of the brain of the Orca are like five times as deep and it's this depth which precisely gives the Orca
[37:47] such a social Dimension that's just three times more dense than ours it means that there are Ora out there that
[38:00] socially are three times as deep as the deepest thinker you and I can imagine th this is
[38:11] huge because nothing else is giving us a better idea of what cognitive emotional intelligence really is what what it necessarily looks like we have opposable thumbs
[38:27] we we we have a sapen sapiens approach to where our neocortex has tumored in a very specific place twice which has led us to the bastardization of our environment to create tools it's brilliant I'm not I'm not dissing this
[38:40] at all but I'm trying to say that there's an ignorance that comes in with that where we insist that intelligence may only be measured by that which utilizes the same sapience that we
[38:53] utilize when in fact the YCA has so much more emotional depth that it brings up the question why would they need to why would they need to develop this opposable thumb technology to distract
[39:10] themselves from the a very equipment that they already owned that they already have when you start to read the sociology the psychology of Ora it's it's it's very
[39:24] heartwrenching to understand or could participate in some pretty violent Behavior with each other and I would like to pose to you probably the only time I could even pose this question to normal thinking people in
[39:40] this world but I would like to suggest to you behind closed doors that that this what we're I'm going to use the word cruelty because I just I just have to admit I I don't really understand
[39:52] what's going on but the thing that I see the cruelty that I I see I think is qualia I think that there is something intrinsic about the type of conscious
[40:07] experience that the orc is having that would have a flavor bundle that is just quite frankly puts us in clip it it it snaps our ability to
[40:21] perceive we have no choice but to call it cruel but it's probably something much more Khali something much more Hindu in a cosmic destructive kind of
[40:36] force and if you start to understand the paradigms of power that with great power comes great responsibility that it almost kind of makes sense to me when I look back and I'm kind of like oh I don't want to look
[40:51] at this but I really want to understand Consciousness and why why is something so intelligent so so cruel and it it makes sense to me it's because I do not see the
[41:03] intelligence of their cruelty I I do not see that I do not have the qual qualic taste
[41:14] buds to render that kind of reality I could judge it if I want and say oh they're cruel they're evil that's fine we could do that or you could go this other place and you can you can look at
[41:28] this striking evidence which I don't know how you're going to argue against this well yeah it's sure it's three times bigger but brain is no measure of of intelligence so how do you measure intelligence well we measure
[41:43] intelligence by brain size but but but listen brain is no no measure of intelligence James it's not be uh getting confused here workers are dumb they don't have Forks we have Forks
[41:58] James we know what we're doing so even when you look at this you notice that we we're two and a half times behind elephants five times behind Orca we really aren't at anywhere near
[42:15] the top of the pyramid when it comes to emotional quala and what we drink out of this world so real quick on this one brain complexity intelligence always been correlated in mammals we've
[42:31] always known that the more folds and convolutions means the more intelligence Orca has a lot more folds a lot more convolutions uh Orca brain are more densely folded region associate of emotions is larger I've said that you
[42:44] have entire limic dimensions of echo okay they've got an entire dimension of information that they're perceiving that we we barely perceive
[42:57] this idea of being able to echolocate keep in mind they they're probably picking up emotions through echolocation I I I can't prove this but if you consider that if you have the
[43:11] capacity that's three times our human brain I want to remind you that with our human brain we can watch the glass and know the emotional Timber of what's in the room behind the glass
[43:25] because of the subtleties of that glass vibrating we can hear through video what someone's saying imagine that you have three times the qual Your
[43:38] Capacity what else could you perceive like for you to imagine that echolocation is a living MRI that gives you this emotional readout over everything
[43:52] everything I think I think a Orca probably tries to imagine what it would like what it would be
[44:02] like to have someone lie to it that its old factory is completely on it just doesn't have the ability to be deceived in that way certainly they have mystery in their lives I would think that they
[44:17] probably seek it out they don't try and banish it like we do just trying to say that it's a beautiful thought experiment to try jack up your qualia and to see what it would be like
[44:31] and to see how it would mimic the Orca because I I think it's it's probably giving us more clues than we could imagine orcas know our language we do not know theirs orcas have culture and language
[44:44] that they inherit believe it or not that a baby orca can learn an experience that was told it by a parent and that Orca will uh facilitate and live show ingrams
[44:57] to the effect that they experienced it simply because it was extrapolated to me what did I just say I told you that orcas can communicate hypothetically with each other and if they can communicate
[45:10] hypothetically I guarant [ __ ] to you they have a concept of God they have a concept of symbiosis they have a concept of Gaia they have a concept of larger larger
[45:24] larger life life conglomerated or because have at least a basic basic understanding of math and physics this these are the
[45:41] aliens they're right here and they're stunning oh my God they're stunning there's a fold I was talking about the brain so now we're getting kind of kind of
[45:56] fancy we're getting fancy because we're not in the reptile brain we're not in the bird brain so we don't have this nice easy Loop right firewor bad remember bird brain data expensive remember that all data is expensive to
[46:11] the bird brain if you were to rescue a bird the first thing you would want to do the bird is to stop giving it input stop giving it light stop giving it sound that light and that sound could be the very thing that ends that Bird's
[46:25] life because it's just simply overwhelmed by the stress of all the sensory information so you have the reptile brain very simple you have the bird brain very simple but then you have humans oh my God we are
[46:38] complex hi my name is Sarah mlin I'm about to ruin your day I'm GNA do that because In the Arms of an Angel right and and you you you run to
[46:56] the TV because you really want to like yourself you want to like yourself so bad you deserve to like yourself so you run the TV to turn this commercial off because Sarah's gonna ruin your
[47:08] day she's gonna ruin it and I I I I I bring this up because I I want you to have an experience of just just How Deeply clever our qualia is
[47:23] Believe It or Not Sarah's Sarah M is is selling pedaling qualia and it's it's a a Usery form of qualia what what what Sarah's doing is
[47:38] hey I got you you're gonna feel like [ __ ] as I'm singing I'm talking to you right now and you feel like [ __ ] showing your dogs you haven't helped this is the fourth time you've seen this commercial
[47:50] you piece of [ __ ] but I'm Sarah mlin and you could feel as guilt-free as I do next time not this time you're [ __ ] this time you're going to sit through this and just
[48:02] suffer but if you call the next time I come to feed you're going to live rentree that this is going to tax you at
[48:15] all you're going to see me hear me about my arms of the Angel and you're going to be like oh thank God I gave this [ __ ] some money that the the heartstrings the backwards Usery
[48:30] neocortex relationships I need you to understand how profound this pra economy is because Sarah is requiring you to have a neocortex for this to even work because she's requiring you to think ahead and
[48:43] to look to the lack of pain you will have in the future the next time she shows herself on the television station that's what it is and when you when you see that kind of farming you understand just how we
[48:58] are in the big leagues we're not playing with reptiles we're not playing with birds we're playing with Pros so the most professional manipulators including you including me that you've ever found are out there Sarah McGlothlin is one of
[49:12] them another one we've talked about is energy but the person that's uh on the side of the busy intersection with the sign they're doing the same thing to your qualia they're burning ingrams in you
[49:26] because you're letting them and those ingrams might sound I'm not speaking for everyone because it's going to depend on how your immune system is when my immune system was lower when I didn't think about ego in
[49:39] the way that I think about now and I would see someone like that and pull up I would feel like I was a piece of [ __ ] if I pretended like I didn't see them I would feel that
[49:51] way my immune system was so devastated by them that I instantly felt bad and there was nothing and if I tried to avoid them I would feel bad for trying to protect myself that's that's called not having
[50:04] ego then you develop ego and you see them and you you start to compassionate them compassionate them first thing I do is I compassionate why do you have a puppy if you were doing so bad that you
[50:19] need my help to feed you let's talk about the puppy how' you get the puppy should you give the puppy to me should should someone else have the
[50:33] puppy because if you can't even feed yourself is a puppy a good idea this might sound all kinds of ways could s well James you're just a [ __ ] or you have no Humanity I don't it doesn't matter I'm telling you this is my immune
[50:48] system my immune system is steing forward because I have a qualia and I want to qualify the ingrams that are being burned in my head right now there's nothing I can do I'm a trapped audience Sarah mlin is singing and I cannot turn the television station
[51:02] off I have to wait for the light to turn green so what do I do right now if I give them money the next time I'm here I will not feel bad but how long will that
[51:14] last and if I do not feel bad will I end up feeling worse about myself because I'm moved so easily by these situations the qual you hear is
[51:29] profound it's it's everywhere every decision every La lack of decision has qualia built into this situation and all of it is built on the fact that you have a neocortex that thinks ahead and that you've been trained through years and years and
[51:43] years and years of looking for not avoiding but looking for qualia in your world and noticing that you find it with pain you notice it because you notice it through pain here's here's the magic
[51:57] part this is so magical you gain quala by avoiding pain how you live the pain in your mind and then you notice you didn't experience it
[52:11] it's the weird [ __ ] math don't ask me how it works but it's prom maath you feel better why do you feel better you have confidence now you have confidence when you're on this street corner and you see this person you know what hey
[52:26] why do you have a different puppy than last time that's that's your immune system your ingrams are acting up saying I want I want a better experience I'm not saying you shouldn't give them money there's all kinds of scenarios where hey
[52:40] you want to come with me or you wanted this or let's do that or what's your name or there's there's a million ways to act in this right all them are going to have different Quia or or lack of call you and that's only going to be determined
[52:53] by your entitlement which is something we talked about before how entitled are you to the koalia in the room if you if you do not feel that you deserve koalia at that intersection you will just
[53:05] feel feel this way here's the thing if you feel like [ __ ] that's Gua you're drinking Gua you're drinking Gua right now weird
[53:20] right this is one of the hardest things I think people have trouble admitting is to why would I cause pain into my life because there's quaia there there's quaia there suffering is a special
[53:34] quaa people bond is a term called trauma bonding it's because they're drinking the qual of how shitty this moment is it's I told you how creative we are
[53:47] we are this creative and more imagine what Shamu imagine what kind of PR economy the or holy cow man there's no telling what's going on there like there's there's really no telling wish we could ask
[54:01] him so pain is informative and dilating this is why slapstick comedy is so effective or are used to be effective I should say I think it kind of gets old
[54:13] pretty fast this is why uh Sarah mlin is effective this is why we rubber neck at an accident we see that pain want to drink it because we can avoid that pain it's going to taste good it's going to taste
[54:29] good excuse me look at the pain I just avoided God that tastes good so if you ever see Sarah gin again you can tell yourself she's saying to you you survive all my attacks by giving me money for empowerment of immunity I
[54:45] know it's complicated but that's literally what she's doing you give me money and I will Empower you with the immunity to not feel bad the next time I come around this is protection money right oldest
[54:59] Mafia trick in the book right I'm gonna vandalize your store James but the good news is if you pay me money I will not vandalize your store tomorrow you're like oh what a win-win what a what a freaking great offer I can't believe
[55:15] you're offering me this yes I know this is a service we're offering for a limited time not only are we complicated ated but we're not oh my goodness oh my goodness we are just a
[55:32] high roller addicts when it comes to finding qualia we want qualia more than life itself do you realize that dopamine gambling pushes more dopamine out of the
[55:45] brain than simple stimulus response stimulous response the reason why every single person at the Super Bowl is watching a coin
[55:58] toss and there's only going to be one of two choices it's not exactly going to be a huge surprise y'all it's either going to be heads or it's going to be tails in the history of coin
[56:11] flipping that's always been what it is one of you right now is what about shut up go get out of here but literally every single time this is it there are no surprises and we still watch we still watch you know why we watch it's not because of the surprise it's because of
[56:26] the gamble the gamble you you put a rat in the cage the rat hits a button he gets a pellet he hits a button he gets a pellet he hits a button he gets a pellet he hits a button
[56:38] he gets a pellet the rat's kind of life is so unsatisfying he says I'm here get a it's a get a I'm here
[56:51] but life lacks something then you start [ __ ] fing with the rat he hits a button there's no pellet comes out he's like oh the lever appears to be broken he hits the lever again the Pella doesn't come
[57:05] out this the SL is broken he hits again and Pella comes out oh never mind that was exciting he he's like a whole new rat I swear he's he's a whole new rat he's got
[57:19] a whole new level of Ingram now he's just been introduced to gambling and he is excited he is excited do you know why because the next time he hits the the lever he doesn't know what's going to
[57:31] happen he doesn't know he doesn't know and he hits it and nothing happens inside he's like oh my God this is the biggest high I've ever had but outside he's saying I am mad

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
57:46] this is Injustice there's Injustice in the world and we will fight and destroy all Injustice secret of D secret of D you know and he's starting this whole thing going on he's he's satisfied he's never been happier I know he's bitching
[57:59] I know he's complaining he's never been happier you've introduced the idea of a 50% [Music] gamble guys this is huge because if you
[58:13] up the amount of times the rat wins the rat gets bored he literally stops giving himself dopamine what do I mean it's half and half right every time he hits it it's
[58:27] 50% chance 50% chance that's as high as he's ever going to get you raise that to 80% chance so now most of the time he gets it the rat loses interest the qualia
[58:42] suffers the coia suffers you take it to 100% the rat's not even doesn't even care doesn't even care it turns out there's a certain rate and that rate is very specific and that there's an
[58:55] Optimum rate of qualia that is extracted through dopamine the secretion of dopamine in your mind and it is only with a coin toss chance a 50/50 chance not 6040 not
[59:10] 8020 and think about it at first you might be this doesn't make any sense but think about it what if for whatever reason because the universe we live in when you flip a coin nine out of 10 times its heads just follow that logic
[59:23] right take it back to to here how many people are watching if nine out of 10 times a coin
[59:36] is heads do you see what my point you do somebody sees my point on this it's true it's the 5050 that keeps us at the fountain it keeps us drinking it's very very important part of this I
[59:51] think so humans are not motivated by success yes humans are motivated by chance by gambling because humans are not here to eat
[01:00:04] food humans are here to eat koalia what's for dinner we're having quala got qualia casserole it's gonna be so good I love some qualia casserole right now oh it's so
[01:00:18] good so we see Evolution requires more than success when me were Pon scum we came out saying repetition repetition repetition and if it were not
[01:00:31] for repetition if it were not for the stalard Persistence of repetition we never would have developed memory right me touch sharp stick me feel sharp pain in finger me touch sharp
[01:00:45] sh stick again me feel sharp pain in finger again me touch sharp stick third time me feel pain in finger repetition was
[01:00:59] absolutely positively the only requirement to get you through your reptile era repetition told you to invent a
[01:01:13] memory if you did not have repetition in the world you never would have developed a memory because you honestly never would have come up with the benefits of a needing one but it is through repetition that you're able to prove
[01:01:27] yourself through memory because you know for a fact no matter what happens if you're hot and you move your body to a place where your eyes seem to register that there is less light that you the
[01:01:41] lizard suddenly do not feel as hot anymore repetition repetition not gambling reptile would never have figured this out if 50% of the time Time by moving
[01:01:55] into the shade you did not get cooler it would have been a lot longer so you see the importance of repetition from the reptile phase the reptile is Led in this world through repetition to develop and
[01:02:10] invent memory once he develops this memory something new can be born gambling is here to develop qualia
[01:02:25] gambling creates qualia so you can see the evolutionary species from the reptile to the hind brain the reptile craves repetition repetition but now the hind brain the
[01:02:38] mammal brain says I want qualia I want quality I want quality and it is precisely this desire for Quality that we've invented deceit danger peculiarity all of these things are trct
[01:02:54] this important thing that we call witness and witness seems to be this resource we use to forge reality your
[01:03:08] reality is forged inside your immune system your immune system is held together by your ego your ego is the electromagnetic uh semblance of all of
[01:03:23] your beliefs none of these things are tangible all of these things the only semblance that you will see that these things even exist in this world is by looking at the engrams in your
[01:03:38] brain everything comes down to those ingrams when we start to understand this goes back to the logic Point telling you that Charisma
[01:03:51] cells you're introduced to the Halo effect the idea that people who are judged to be attractive are typically perceived in a positive light and that that positive light changes every single
[01:04:05] other thing that they discuss and share and that you magically feel that everything else is also inside of that Halo also and so they take normal faces and
[01:04:18] they apply symmetry to these faces this is an example of one on the screen they symmetry most of us because we live in a a beautiful complex world we develop a symmetry from our left brain and our right brain this reflects
[01:04:33] itself in the reflexology and that you can take a picture of your face and quotequote fix it you can make it symmetrical and by making these faces symmetrical or asymmetrical this halo effect was proven
[01:04:47] in a clinical lab where a letter was sent and inside the letter a picture was enclosed and the letter had a certain content that was the same the only thing different was the picture itself either
[01:05:01] the picture was asymmetrical or was symmetrical in some way and that they noticed a very strong corollary or P value between the people that were considered symmetrical versus How likely someone
[01:05:14] was to agree with the sentiment inside the note I say this because I think there's an even more profound lesson here because I do not believe that there is necessarily this abstract concept of
[01:05:29] who's attractive and who's not attractive I I just don't I don't think it works that way I just think it's more complex as all I think certainly many people might find the same person attractive but the reasons that we state for why we find those attractive I don't
[01:05:43] think that we've really really gotten in touch with with what those reasons are I say this because I believe that that congruent y seems to Trump
[01:05:58] authenticity when you symmetrize a face we say it's more attractive but really it's more congruent we're attracted to people that are congruent in the world because it
[01:06:12] shows us the stability it shows us a kind of immune response they have that no matter what's happening to the world there's there's congruence these different
[01:06:26] Minds not just left and right but id ego and super ego have this kind of congruence to it I I would argue that congruence is probably the most charismatic thing you could see in a person you're watching
[01:06:41] their micro language being congruent with itself as they're communicating something to you I believe that we compassionate this feeling you can imagine how great it must feel to have
[01:06:55] congruence and so when we see someone with congruence we we we bestow on them the halo effect most of the world that we see now whether real or not because I don't know
[01:07:08] if the state's doing this I really don't but is driven on the idea of advertising and the idea of advertising is driven on the idea of a spokesperson or a model and that that spokesperson or model literally always has the same
[01:07:22] characteristics we've learned to recognize who those people are and now you know why if you tie this in with with uh what we've already discussed a while ago on
[01:07:34] the placebo effect you know that the caliber of the person's vibration is going to be directly conducive to the effectiveness of the medicine uh white male lab coat with clipboard that's a
[01:07:48] certain weight with white beard and uh in a in a clinical environment with FL florescent lights with a visit that's less than seven minutes that's given a pill out of a box that's shiny the pill is a capsule and the capsule has a logo
[01:08:04] the logo has blue and yellow balls inside mixed together that you can see through that's medicine I didn't even talk about what was in the medicine I just told you that all of
[01:08:17] those things are are profound factors in placebic effect the effectiveness of a medication this proves the quala this proves the Charisma this proves the idea that this
[01:08:30] is not really about logic this is about Placebo this is about uh pacing pacing we don't talk about pacing enough in fact Nancy and I were talking
[01:08:43] earlier today we discussed this idea of pacing someone because ultimately you're never going to change anyone you're going to be able to Pace someone and really what you're doing is you're compassionating their walk and you're just joining them
[01:08:59] for a while you can go a little bit faster than they do you can go a little bit slower than they do but ultimately you're following their lead you're just pacing from that [Music]
[01:09:13] um this is a closest sort of image I can show you about ingrams just to kind of burn in your head this
[01:09:25] idea of these overlaying layers sentiment is a smell of quaa from the flower of every moment you you smell the sentimentality you you say you say things to your friends oh this is a
[01:09:41] really special night why because you you you smell the flower of this moment so fashion Nuance playfulness all these are dimensions of qualia
[01:09:54] when we have events when we met in Tennessee when you go to your birthday party or the special fire that you have or the new moon Fire or the full moon
[01:10:08] fire whatever it is you the sentimentality is felt because it's pressed through the schedule of time and there's only one full moon in this in this

<h2>Chapter 1. Understanding Qualia and the Brain</h2><h3>1.1. Exploring the Concept of Qualia</h3><p>Qualia, a term often used in philosophy and psychology, refers to the subjective quality of conscious experience. It encompasses the raw feelings, sensations, and perceptions that individuals experience. The significance of qualia lies in its role in shaping our understanding of the world around us and influencing our behavior and decision-making processes.</p><h4>Definition and Significance</h4><p>Qualia represent the essence of our subjective experiences, ranging from the taste of chocolate to the feeling of warmth from sunlight. These subjective qualities cannot be fully described or understood by language alone but are deeply personal and unique to each individual. Understanding qualia is crucial in comprehending the richness and diversity of human experience, as they form the basis of our perceptions and interactions with the world.</p><h4>Relationship to Dopamine Secretion</h4><p>Dopamine, often referred to as the "feel-good" neurotransmitter, plays a significant role in modulating our experiences and perceptions. Research suggests that dopamine secretion in the brain is closely linked to the processing of qualia. When individuals experience pleasurable sensations or engage in rewarding activities, such as eating delicious food or receiving praise, dopamine levels increase, enhancing the intensity of qualia associated with these experiences.</p><h3>1.2. The Role of Dopamine in Experience</h3><p>Dopamine's Influence on Perception</p><p>The release of dopamine in response to various stimuli influences our perception of the world around us. Higher levels of dopamine enhance the salience of certain experiences, making them more memorable and impactful. For example, when individuals encounter novel or rewarding stimuli, such as a beautiful sunset or a heartfelt compliment, dopamine release heightens the intensity of qualia associated with these experiences, leading to a heightened sense of pleasure and satisfaction.</p><p>Impact on Memory Formation</p><p>Furthermore, dopamine plays a crucial role in memory formation and consolidation. Studies have shown that heightened dopamine levels during learning or emotionally significant events facilitate the encoding of memories, making them more vivid and enduring. As a result, experiences associated with elevated dopamine levels are more likely to be retained in long-term memory and influence future behavior and decision-making processes.</p><h2>Chapter 2. Evolutionary Insights: Reptilian vs. Mammalian Brain</h2><h3>2.1. Survival Priorities of the Reptilian Brain</h3><p>The reptilian brain, also known as the basal ganglia, is the oldest part of the human brain, evolutionarily speaking. It is responsible for regulating basic survival functions such as breathing, heart rate, and fight-or-flight responses. The primary priorities of the reptilian brain revolve around ensuring the individual's survival in the face of threats and challenges.</p><h4>Novelty, Threats, and Food</h4><p>The reptilian brain is highly attuned to novel stimuli and potential threats in the environment. It reacts instinctively to unfamiliar or potentially dangerous situations, triggering physiological responses aimed at protecting the individual from harm. Additionally, the reptilian brain governs basic drives such as hunger and thirst, motivating individuals to seek out food and sustenance to ensure their survival.</p><h4>Instinctual Responses to Pain</h4><p>One of the key functions of the reptilian brain is to respond to pain and discomfort. It generates instinctual responses aimed at avoiding or minimizing sources of pain, such as withdrawing from a hot surface or recoiling from a sharp object. Pain serves as a valuable survival mechanism, signaling potential threats to the individual's well-being and prompting immediate action to alleviate or escape from the source of discomfort.</p><h3>2.2. The Mammalian Brain: Embracing Pain for Growth</h3><p>In contrast to the reptilian brain's instinctual aversion to pain, the mammalian brain, which includes the limbic system and neocortex, exhibits a more nuanced response to painful stimuli. Rather than simply avoiding pain, the mammalian brain perceives pain as a source of valuable information and an opportunity for learning and growth.</p><h4>Warmth, Learning, and Growth</h4><p>The mammalian brain is characterized by its capacity for warmth, empathy, and social connection. It places a greater emphasis on emotional experiences and interpersonal relationships, viewing pain as an integral part of the human experience. Rather than shying away from discomfort, individuals with a developed mammalian brain embrace pain as a catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery.</p><h4>Perception of Pain as Valuable Information</h4><p>In the mammalian brain, pain is perceived as a rich source of information about oneself and the surrounding world. Rather than dismissing or ignoring painful experiences, individuals engage with them openly, seeking to understand their underlying causes and significance. This proactive approach to pain allows individuals to derive valuable insights, develop resilience, and cultivate a deeper understanding of themselves and others.</p>
