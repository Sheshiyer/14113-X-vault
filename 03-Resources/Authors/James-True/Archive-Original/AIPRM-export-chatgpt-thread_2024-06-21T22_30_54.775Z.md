[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] there's the parasympathetic there's the sympathetic and there is the anic and at the bottom at the base of this is this this enteric uh Kingdom it's a kingdom that that rules from the
[00:13] esophagus the stomach the intestines the pancreas the gallbladder this this system in you is basically a tapeworm that's been
[00:24] saddled by a larger organism and that larger organism is is your uh dolinic uh outer shell technically your esophagus is and
[00:38] your your stomach is its own living creature it's not even technically it it has its own neurons uh there's a lot of neurons in your stomach uh a lot and more more than
[00:51] in your heart in fact and that that this this neurological system is only recently been recognized as a brain and by recognizing it as a brain it becomes more than fair and more than
[01:04] adequate for us to recognize it as an an uh its own entity and I think the best way to understand this is is is three different kingdoms there are three kingdoms inside of you and at the base of this kingdom
[01:17] is is this cic Kingdom and if you can picture your stomach with a saddle on it and that saddle is your bone structure and all the other outer organs that are relying on that horse right they're relying on
[01:31] that Steed to uh uh carry them through the terrain safely and by that terrain technically the ground in which this horse uh carries you would be the food that you pass through your your membrane
[01:46] and as you place food inside the top of your Taurus and it and it exits out the the the bottom of your Taurus what you're really doing is giving a foot pad for this horse to
[01:57] walk and so time it's self from this if you look at what time is to this enic Kingdom time is the passage of food through its Bay that food is birthed to it from some
[02:12] unknown source outside of it and that this food is past and that that the journey requires that this anic stomach uh choose what it what it wants to learn along this journey it is not able to dictate the journey to itself it does
[02:27] not have full control over the destiny of what food will come to it its only power lies in what it chooses to digest and this should be familiar to you because it should remind you of you
[02:40] yourself that the chemical makeup that is the world the weather the system of time the system of everything that we have is its own passage of Road and that you your experiences or
[02:54] feat that have no choice but to carry yourself through this journey and so you can compassionate this enic system is both autonomous but also Bound in fact it's bound by you you were the
[03:08] ruler of this inic system you you alone are responsible for the torture or the love that that inic systems going to receive as you give it yeast as you give
[03:20] it salt as you give it sugar you are uh acting as a God you are a bow the first definition of of God came from the idea of bad
[03:33] weather and it would be wise to consider the cic kingdom as uh victims of your weather and that the weather you pass it is directly related to the protein chains or the lack of protein chains
[03:47] that you choose to distribute down the river it's River of time which is your your membrane so separating yourself from your enic
[04:01] system and seeing it as its own separate entity answers a lot of questions about addiction diet Comfort what food does to you why you have a certain passion for food but maybe that food might make you
[04:15] feel a different way and why there's a uh the the that lack of Harmony sometimes that might exist is actually uh quite natural when you understand that this is its own kingdom that this
[04:27] is its separate um um separate place and for the first time ever if if you if if you've never seen it this way for the first time ever you would begin to
[04:39] compassionate A system that you rule over that you you you would begin to extend or bestow this idea of giving witness to this creature itself and that the opening of that witness would would
[04:54] actually leave the pressure on its system to dump or refuse Sarat oent to you that it's its only voice that it has to communicate to you is this
[05:08] pleasure and the pleasure that you get from food is much more profound than you think and the pleasure that you derive from food is also chalk full of the humans that actually prepared it a homecooked meal is a home-cooked meal
[05:21] because it holds other kinds of energy and that the space between the notes of every song is no different than the space between the smells of every taste and that this space can be packed full of
[05:33] this intangible thing we call Consciousness so in that space in that intangible there is the ability to communicate with a creature that's living inside your body that you as Osiris would have this
[05:50] underling Kingdom living underneath you above that system relying on it is the sympathetic system your eyes your heart your lungs your stomach your intestines your joints and your skin the system would be nothing without
[06:05] without its horse the system is its own kingdom its own Consciousness your your heart has its own beat your breath has its own Rhythm right and that these rhythms and
[06:20] beats go on regardless of whether you're conscious or not whether you're sentient or not whether you're stupid or not that these systems have fail safe AI living
[06:32] inside them that automatically run and operate there is simple as a thermostat in your home but at the same time they have their own Matrix of emotions desires and what they want those two are
[06:47] are also imprisoned in a way inside this higher system this parasympathetic system you know what it's probably not exactly that way
[07:00] I'm sorry I'm amending this as I'm speaking really in a lot of ways the the the parasympathetic is almost a slave to the sympathetic but in a way of sort of justifying what's happening and it makes sense that I might be confused about
[07:14] this at first because we get the same confused about Washington DC that that we think Washington DC is in charge but but really the role of the politician as we just discussed recently is is not
[07:27] necessarily to change po policy or to create policy but simply to explain to the people that the policy that's already there is is not going anywhere and to give reasons and excuses to labor
[07:40] the blame of that is really an inflammatory response so if you really look at who holds the keys to your body I think you're really looking in a sympathetic place and that sympathetic place you're
[07:53] going to find out tonight is your spirit animal that spirit animal it's certainly wise I'm not asking you not to trust it but I'm also asking you to consider that your spirit animal needs
[08:07] you just as much as you you need your spirit animal and this might be something that you're not used to hearing because you feel that the spirit animal is sort of a a one-way
[08:20] Street and it's funny be we have that same false relationship with our inic system too our what we digest what we choose to eat as we talked about last time the uh
[08:33] sexual arousal is an involuntary process not necessarily controlled by your conscious mind and I I spoke briefly about how funny that seems to be when you if we believe the idea that we only
[08:47] evolved from this place because we were uh ponum fornicating ourselves into a fetish of survival that creating a Consciousness that would not allow us to turn on or off off our uh sexual
[09:01] activity would might actually make it harder for us to reproduce which gives us I think deeper Clues into not only why you're here but more importantly how you're here which is the time machines that we
[09:15] discussed last time this idea of there being a forbrain and a and a hindbrain operating and so the lessons we learned last time become even more complicated
[09:28] when we start to understand that that limic communication is a Prana economy a word we we a phrase we use a lot to talk about but to break down this pra economy you you can think of it as a chemical
[09:41] reaction a a reaction of several chemicals placed into uh the same space the same environment and that uh if you understood chemistry enough you would be able to predict I.E compassionate what those chemicals are going to do once
[09:56] they find each other once they discover that each other exist exists and once they seek out the symbiosis the symbiosis appears to have no free will when you look at chemistry you might want to say oh these chemicals
[10:10] oil and water have no free will they are bound to the idea that they are in opposition I I I would tend to agree with that I would tend to say yeah water and oil don't have free will and we
[10:23] might even argue well yeah it's because they're not alive or or we might argue that that their time machine hasn't come online yet and there is an autopilot built into all of your proteins all of your amino acids that would act just
[10:37] like chemistry and that you would automatically have a base root response a template response that allows you to exist and survive in this world that you would not be born
[10:50] still and remain still until your Consciousness formed that that would lead to you being thrown away and so you've had to develop certain system sys that were would persist regardless of whether or not you were
[11:03] online and the uh tendency for us to uh commit this phrase emotional pedophilia I talk about it really shines itself true here when we when we think and insist that everyone around us is
[11:17] online and this insistence that everyone is online is typically where we lose our compassion and our safety which loses us this topshed tier Kingdom
[11:32] called parasympathetic which is part of what what we're learning today so this pra economy before before the soul comes online and even while the soul is online there are these three basic rules and
[11:45] these three basic rules are everyone sheds everyone eats and ultimately everyone agrees that every chemical that you mix in a vile agrees and it may not look like it agree you may say oh these don't
[12:00] agree at all they're they're volatile in fact but actually no they they are in agreement it's you and I that created the idea that Civilization would always be tame kind and polite it's nature and chemistry that's been telling you the
[12:13] whole time you're not actually paying attention and so the pra economy that develops really would would have nothing to do with how Adept someone is and it really it would more have to do is how online someone
[12:27] is when you come online you end up rendering your own free will I believe but until you do there is a base free will that is built for you that comes out of the factory that just simply allows you to
[12:40] survive so this is at the heart of pra economy and and that you yourself or are subject to this pra economy and and you it's sort of a luxury in a sense because you can go below below deck tend to
[12:53] something else and and give up steering the boat but you've got autopilot on and the Rudder is constantly keeping you at your vector it would be impossible for you to
[13:06] survive without this kind of system so you in fact are a trinity and there's really nothing nothing more to argue about that that you see it working in these three
[13:20] kingdoms so everyone has a neocortex but it was Sapien sapiens that turned it into a time machine that that homo sapen said I want to turn my cortex into
[13:33] a violent tumor of growth I want it to explode and that that was such a a massive change from the standard set of of of reptile of vertebrae and that that massive change
[13:48] for whatever reason I I I think it's hard to to not um want to explain that that this was somehow manipulated on purpose because For What whatever specific reason this same Homo Sapien
[14:01] after taking a a pretty abrupt 180 degree turn in its species and actually flipping its uh flipping it its hippocampus to where the tail of its brain actually started to point forward
[14:15] much like a scorpion's tail and that for the first time we began to insist that this neocortex is more important than we think and so homo sapien takes it one more step he he he doubles down and he
[14:29] grows a growth on top of that growth and for the first time the neocortex explodes before it explodes you'll see here in this illustration just a brief a brief summary of all the other animals that have this forbrain as we talked about last time
[14:44] the forbrain you could look at as your future machine or or the or the past machine so every animal still has their seed and time but the size of the forebrain could could be said to roughly
[14:57] uh roughly point to the size of their future time machine going to contradict this just just only slightly when we talk about bird brains but it's more just to dissolve a uh a common misconception we
[15:10] have about how how dumb we think birds are um oops need to turn that off so everyone has this neocortex which means actually everyone has this sense of
[15:25] self that the neocortex really really would probably atrophy if it didn't have something to do in fact if we get to the thalmus tonight I I'll show you what happens if there is nothing to do and so the neocortex that's busy is the
[15:40] neocortex that insists it needs more space it needs more resources to produce when it comes to looking at at how far you live in time that the this is the map that I prepared to show you just how that
[15:56] works that there is a reptilian Underlord from the future not an Overlord but an actual Underlord and this un Underlord from the future is only there because you yourself are are are too far away from it that you're in
[16:11] the past but this reptilian Underlord is is on the precipice on The Cutting Edge of present and you can see this there's a
[16:23] 14 millisecond reflex from the Jaw a 30 millisecond ref flects from the blink notice that your mouth Works faster than your eyes I believe this gives you a clue over what this reptilian Underlord
[16:37] finds more important or more importantly finds more reliable or more trustable for his survival and so we I've got these listed for you sequentially because you can see his jaw is first his blink is second at
[16:51] 90 milliseconds he can move his head that even before his head he's got this jaw reflex which has to be uh 10 times faster the mouth reflex is 10 times faster than thought
[17:05] itself which is why when you this is why pigeons uh die when they eat rice at weddings the reptile brain swallows it doesn't say should I eat that it swallows it doesn't have a an
[17:20] opportunity to ask two of those luxurious questions should and even the question itself is it do I have a choice in what I do so what I'm trying to explain really delicately
[17:33] here is is that the fact that you live in the future the fact that you have this Prometheus is is literally the only reason why you even have free will that that this this weird stretchy rubber band relationship that you've
[17:47] developed with time gives you this window for a Quantum of possibilities to exists and it's very much a Quantum because you compute all of your possibilities and every single system in your body Believe It or Not takes these
[18:01] possibilities and fires them to one place called The thelus it sends them to a specific place so every single separate organism gets to put their two cents into their system and it's the
[18:14] thalmus itself that acts as this uh Bridal chamber this consecration that who will the prince Mary will determine the future of the Kingdom but every single Suitor from
[18:29] every single country will be sending their Hope Chest in their offerings into the phalus but the thalmus itself will only choose to mount with one to choose to bond with one and
[18:43] so the decision process that you see is very much the same thing you have a Quantum a million tude of decisions that you could make but all of those are converged in a Quantum inside the thalmus which means that the
[18:56] thalmus collapses reality it collapses reality what you and I call reality I should say into the present it takes all of the suggestions from the past and all of the suggestions
[19:12] from the future and conveys them into this inner chamber this sacred chamber that's literally what that word thalmus means this sacred pillow and that night something is
[19:26] consecrated something your distance from the thalmus is directly proportional to your rank inside the body if you were second in command you
[19:39] will only have one neuron jump between you and the phalus if you were third in command you will have three neurological jumps between you and the thalmus every one of these neurological jumps is an opportunity for the bureaucracy around
[19:53] you to override your vote that you send your tribute to the thalmus and you say this is so important that we swallow this this round Taurus that you see with sprinkles on top we have determined to
[20:07] be a donut and and the the delicate nature of our kingdom rest on you swallowing that dut right now the joy it will bring us as a
[20:20] people will allow us to shine forever and the thelist is like wow that's a pretty strong case you make right and there is a bishop a queen of swords that can override every decision every
[20:36] Everything the bishop says The Rook says the Knight says can be overridden by this one sacred sacred queen that has not one jump from the
[20:48] thalmus but actually vetos the thalmus we've spoken about this before and it's the nose the old factory system itself the very system that you chose in the top of your mouth to turn
[21:01] off when you were born you shut that off it's been an atropy ever since what you think is smell is actually a passive sonar that you used to have an active sonar I apologize if you don't know this
[21:14] but a submarine has the ability for active sonar which is you might have heard the symbol of ping and there's a ping sound that's sent and that that ping is is the sending of a signal that
[21:27] it active sonar will come back and they will listen to how long it took that ping to arrive versus a passive sonar which is not to send a ping but simply to listen to listen to Listen to
[21:39] listen and that paive sonar is the parabola the the peripheral vision and the macular Vision you staring directly at something would be this sense of of active sonar
[21:54] to your queen the old factory sister system it has more power than every piece combined she has all of their powers combined doesn't she with this veto what it really does is give her the
[22:09] ability to absorb the power of the bishop to go in diagonal the power of the Rook to go horizontal or vertical the power of the Knight to literally jump over pawns to achieve things
[22:21] because she holds the veto over all of them so she has all of these skills so when you start to understand who and what you are you you were a nothing more
[22:33] than a conglomerate of Symbio uh symbiosis this is a scary concept to the mind as it comes online which is why like a jet ski we have the safety mechanism built in which which keeps us
[22:47] offline until you finally approach the cockpit of this ship that you've were born inside of and slowly grew up in on your your own and you one day you wander through this Millennium Falcon and you
[23:02] turn right down this Corridor and you go down these steps and suddenly you're in this giant viewer window and you see outside and there's a steering wheel and there's a
[23:13] navigation and you suddenly control this ship and it's a scary Endeavor could be terrifying right and so so too is this concept of when and how or even if we come
[23:28] [Music] online and as I said once you come online one of the scary things is really doing the math and understanding that my mouth has 10 times the power of
[23:40] my arms that my mouth is 10 times ahead of myself of my arms and time which kind of shows you that you were screaming through time the reptile screams through time with his racing goggles on with his
[23:53] jaw first his eyes second his head third his neck neck fourth his shoulders fifth his arms his legs and at the very end trailing like a pathetic overweight cross country runner
[24:08] in eth grade not referring to anyone except for maybe someone me anyway what way at the behind way behind everyone else after the girls race is started is this little neocortex at 500
[24:22] milliseconds the very very end of the line the Caboose of the train is you that you yourself are the Caboose and it's so terrifying that you're that you're convincing yourself
[24:36] that that you control the train and that the tracks are yours and that they're laid down be until you slowly see through the veil of Hades and slowly uncover the fact that this is how it
[24:49] works that this is the system and this startle reflex in milliseconds is really showing you this reptilian Underlord Lord and more importantly where you stand on his chain of
[25:05] command the Triune brain I'm sure is a system or concept many of you hopefully maybe have heard if not um I'll just remind you but this reptilian inner brain this limic brain this uh second
[25:19] brain which is what what we were calling last time the the hindbrain or or Epimetheus and the neocortex is Prometheus so The Reptilian is the now the lyic brain is the past the neocortex
[25:32] is the future but I really want to hammer home a couple more analogies because I think it'll really help you build a neurology to understanding these different kingdoms one of which is that we are looking at the ID the ego and the
[25:47] super ego that the ID is this reptilian part of you that the ego is this lyic part of you and the super ego is this neocortex part of you and that that if you're not even 26 years old you don't even have a super
[26:01] ego and I think right now before lamura hits we live in this Dark Age time where we treat everyone as if they have a neocortex by the time they're
[26:14] 18 and it's just simply not really dealing with the same species at that point the same thing is reflected in the concept of id ego and super ego are kind of too esoteric for you or if they're just too general or
[26:29] you don't even like that framework I think you could also look at this as The Reptilian is the eye the lyic brain is the am and the neocortex is the string name uh string name meaning whatever your
[26:42] name is if if I was just talking to you I would have put your name here but whatever your name is would be that that last piece as we learned it comes online your name comes online probably a reason
[26:56] why Jewish Native American both have this tradition deep in their past of when you turn 13 you you become something your neocortex is half online right it's half the work has been done
[27:10] and you choose your name you you choose this concept of of who you are before you move forward so inside of you this red part is a joystick in a plane right it's a a jet fighter and there's this joystick
[27:25] and it's got the throttle and it's got the fire button and you could see it right there you literally wrap your fingers around this thing and wrap your thumb on top of it and that that's your motor cortex it moves your flaps it moves every flap it

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
27:38] it it turns on every Thruster and it fires every bullet everyone including the sexual uh number one and number two right number one number two and number three all of those systems are are fired
[27:51] by that same core and that same core is living 480 milliseconds ahead of you that's a long time that's a long long long time to live ahead of
[28:03] you to remind you again the past this hindbrain it's looking back the Yellow Part the future this neocortex it's bent forward it's looking forward in the present this this joystick in the yid I want to take this moment though to point
[28:18] out that that everything about you and your essence is actually built into this hindbrain and forebrain and those those things both happen to stop at the neck which means that the future and the
[28:31] past are only in your head that you you you tricky tricky bastard that that you've been painting the future and the past so well in your head this whole time that you you may
[28:44] not actually realize that they do not exist outside of you and the answer is hey guess what they they do not exist outside of you you made them you made these things appear this is your quantum you were your own
[28:58] Quantum Galaxy right and you're able to convolve the universe you see and to collapse your wave of possibility into what you believe will happen ultimately what your will is but we're still learning to navigate
[29:12] our will much like a fighter pilot learns to uh handle the G forces of his own his own stick and until he's ready until he knows he won't faint Under Pressure there's only going to be so
[29:24] fast he's going to go inside this ship to Zink this home even further if you've ever paid attention at all when you turn on a computer that the first thing that happens when you turn on a computer is your bios boots
[29:38] up your bios and it looks like this black screen on the bottom right doesn't necessarily say American Meat Trends but that's a pretty popular one but sometimes you'll see energy star or Dell or something else but it's it's the bio
[29:52] booting up and if you read that you you could click on Tab and you could enter into the operating system of your reptilian core and you could change your time clock you could change uh the settings on your RAM chips you could you
[30:05] could assign new primary hard drives and and literally tell it where your body is and there's these low-level processes and it's kind of tricky and scary and most people don't like to even go into their bios because talking to the reptile is serious business it's not a fun activity it's not a friendly
[30:19] interface in fact why because it doesn't have the luxury of this past and present it has to be spoken to and very direct ways where you can only enter numbers like one through four you know different choices like that it's very
[30:33] simplistic above the BIOS though right after that bios window boots up you notice something fancier comes on your operating system comes on and if you're on Mac or if you're on Windows or if you're looking at your cell phone you're watching that operating system come on
[30:48] and that that operating system is really your hindbrain I say that because most operating systems or every operating system that's going to survive has built into it a dummy proof system that tries
[31:02] to make it harder for the driver to destroy it that through password memory through hey are you sure you want to throw this away to hey man are you sure you want to empty your trash can to hey your firewall's not on or are you sure you want to see this site or you sure you
[31:16] want to download this program that from the very system that the hindbrain comes on comes a system of doubt that the past brings you the ability to doubt the now to doubt the future to doubt what might happen to
[31:30] someone and that that doubt comes from this very idea of learning to test pain and that pain teaches us doubt and doubt teaches us resilience to change it doesn't teach us anything else but just
[31:44] to try something so with the very heart of every motivation you have comes this gift that came to you which is doubt doubt in doubt in the present doubt in in your your insistence that if you do nothing everything will will be okay and
[31:58] so all systems come online from there this is your operating system and as you're using your operating system you notice that inside your operating system there are several programs you can run several of them and you can open up calculator you can open
[32:13] up your browser and literally go anywhere you can open up Photoshop paint some pictures and all these applications are simply identities and that you yourself the identity that you think you are your name your string name is the application
[32:28] or the game that you were running inside the operating system which is resting on top of the BIOS which booted the computer and literally tells the machine inside where everything goes this is your motor
[32:42] cortex the thalmus is the only one that has the key to communicate with the motor cortex where the motor cortex can trust it and so all these decisions are collapsed through your operating system
[32:54] into your bios and you hear this magnetic needle right or erase right and erase right and erase a piece of silicon inside your body inside your hard
[33:10] drive the I and the am would be the noun and the verb wouldn't it and that the I the noun the sense of I develops a sense of am as we talked about only by having a sense of memory and only through
[33:24] memory do we develop the past which basically proves that the am exists inside the lyic self the limic self is the amness of you The Reptilian self is the eyess of
[33:38] you the eyess is pure reflex the amness is pure oh [ __ ] did that hurt or did that not hurt and above this is your name you can see different systems how they each run I won't read them all here but the
[33:53] reptilian complex run in the basil ganglia the basil basically just a a a simple word for an area of the brain this Gangi is technically a misnomer um
[34:05] it's should be actually called a nuclei but it was named before our anatomy got straight but basically just a collection a collection in a space so The Reptilian is a collection of reflexes that are centralized into a
[34:20] space that you and I start to call a system and that you and I would only know that it's a system because we have a past and a future right that without the past and future we wouldn't even know it's a system which is why I'm trying to tell you and convey that the eye doesn't know it's a system the eye
[34:35] does not know its separation from the world you show a reptile its reflection in the mirror and with the exception of the few idios syncratic cases or or uh
[34:48] sorry that's the wrong word but but there's a few people that that love their lizard so much that they insist that this doesn't happen but but most animals will attack their own reflection if kind of terrifying terrifying because they don't
[35:00] have an the I has no am to relate to it has no idea to even learn about itself cannot learn about yourself and until you have this memory to build this idea of test response test response test
[35:14] response every every reaction you have to what you think is consciousness really boils down to you testing whether something is conscious or not how do you test something you secretly manipulate it into making it self adjust to
[35:29] something that makes it more comfortable what if I was to tell you that every conversation you have is that you pushing someone into a state of of discomfort and that the reason why you're pushing someone into a state of discomfort is because you want to know
[35:44] if they are alive so what do you say you say hello there how is well James how is Hello there a state of discomfort because all of us are socially connected through through our inner ear and through the
[35:59] inner ear you've been trained in a process where if you hear something you answer and you you physically feel itchy if you don't you feel discomfort if you don't so when someone says hello there they're actually putting you on the spot
[36:12] they're actually saying prove to me that you exist prove to me that you are alive it's a challenge question is what it is and so you answer back you answer back proving that you exist why why do you prove that because
[36:26] just demonstrated that you have the ability to accept something from them and respond to it which really means you're just showing that you are reactive that your your reactions are
[36:40] online right and this this defines the relationship that they have with you from the moment you prove that by saying hello there right now the system recalls itself because you've set up a protocol
[36:54] you just like a web browser when I go to HTT tpsg google.com I tell Google hello I'd like to establish a tcpi connection with you through a secure socket layer do you agree hello there is hello I'd
[37:07] like to establish an asynchronous connection between the two of us using the protocol of English do you agree and his answer hello is that agreement both of those Agreements are
[37:20] YouTu now forging a reality a wormhole between universe and universe and that worm only exists because of this relationship this
[37:34] Trinity this Trinity that exists so you develop things like jealousy one of the most beautiful emotions you want to know why jealousy exists in the world because there are people that do not know that they they
[37:49] exist and jealousy reminds them wait a minute a person that deserves more and this jealousy I feel is the inspiration that I have that I deserve this thing that that I do not that I do not have
[38:01] right now it's the most beautiful motivation jealousy is it shows you that you have lack and the only reason why you have lack is because you found a shell that was big enough to fill your
[38:15] potential and that your potential has to get off its ass right that's what jealousy is so all of these all of these uh emotions we have are the
[38:28] limic systems growing exercising themselves right proving that they have relevance in this world which is really the essence of am I am I am I am I
[38:41] relevate I relevate I relevate right I am relevant to myself to others around me I am I am so this Trinity gives you three different
[38:54] kingdoms to trade with you trade with these kingdoms don't you you're who you think you truly are is really an a uh a like a some sort of Diplomat and you're opening trade routes
[39:09] into each of these kingdoms that are autonomous that their economies don't necessarily need you that you have to do what they have to do you have to prove your relevance to them by saying I'm online now and the first thing The Reptilian says is no you're not dude you're going to go to bed or you're
[39:23] drinking a beer or you're not you you don't know that pure dangers of of you know of hypothermia you're not even wearing a jacket and that slowly you build Authority you build confidence inside these kingdoms by showing up for
[39:37] them by relying on them by recognizing them by analizing them and by freaking talking to them by talking to your stomach by talking to your lyic self by acknowledging your jealousy as a
[39:52] as a beautiful sign of a Hermit grab who's just found a bigger place to live all of these reactions are giving you opportunities to respond to yourself and every time you respond to yourself you're given more Privileges and one day you'll notice the
[40:06] reptilian Overlord has given you the keys itself to the very cockpit that drives your body and that's that's a special relationship and what happens then the selft Talk
[40:19] Stops you become a different kind of antenna and your life uh your life changes just from there you might call this a sidebar but I really I really want to hit this home I I briefly mentioned this last time
[40:36] this idea of of these postures de decorticate and de de decerebrate I've been singing decerebrate Good Times decorate to try
[40:48] and remember but it's like decorate oh decorticate yeah I want you to look at these postures that the the if you could fire every reflex in the body right if you could pinch all the nerves that you
[41:02] know send in a reflex I think that by pinching those nerves what you're really doing is you're demanding now that that you're shutting off the territorial authority
[41:16] of the hindbrain and the forebrain and by shutting off those territories your identity is reduced to your inner brain to this Reptilian Brain and so the The Reflex action of
[41:31] the body when it's in a state of of this this decortication if that's a word or or decerebration I I hope that you can see from these pictures that I've shown is really just expressing the the true
[41:45] nature of who it is that this posture is the self living inside this inner brain living inside this edness the bios the body takes the shape of the BIOS
[41:59] because the body is the BIOS right all the reflexes have been triggered and so you become the actual shape of your Consciousness right and that that's what this is this is a cross-section of your of your spinal
[42:19] [Music] column and when you deal with the world you're going to have negative emotions that come in and you're going to have positive emotions that that come in and you're going to send out negative emotions and you're going to send out
[42:31] positive emotions and what those really mean I think could be reduced to the words dorsal and ventral and that this idea I turn my back on you is the Oracle of Mythology explaining to you that it knows exactly
[42:47] how the body works that when you were in a parasympathetic State you open your lines of communication to ventral communication and vental communication would give you
[42:58] this ability to share and by sharing you are now reading the faces of others in the room and by reading the faces of others in the room you are becoming susceptible to all of their emotions because you tap into their face and you
[43:12] create this HTTP connection just as you do as Google and you actually don't get to dictate what Google's going to send you and they could play you some of the most obscene information or propaganda you could see and there's really no way
[43:25] that you could unsee that because of the nature of how we work and because of that your body has to have these really strong mechanisms that are built in where if if the body receives enough of
[43:40] a negative signal that causes it enough stress the body will switch into dorsal mode and dedicate all of its resources to its back so when something turns its back on you it's actually saying I'm
[43:54] only going to watch you like a hawk now I'm only going to become dorsal really really means I'm only going to become a a furent or
[44:05] sensory right I'm only going to become receptive much like a a a uh when a predator finds a rabbit the rabbit becomes receptive and simply watches the
[44:19] Predator from a dorsal place the rabbit will not communicate because its vental system the front of its spinal column says no no we do not engage in the luxury of communication because this is
[44:33] a dangerous situation our dorsal has taken over it needs all of these things which is why our motor our eer systems that run down our spine because they come down our ventral Pathways we can sometimes faint we lose the ability to
[44:48] even move the reason why we cannot move is because our dorsal system is overloaded and is running things this is a safety mechanism it's a safety response it's actually you your body doing a good job
[45:03] which is why it's so important for you to come online because when you're online you're going to be able to give your vental system the confidence it needs when when it's needed same for your dorsal too
[45:16] so the intrinsic nature of reality itself as being a negative or a positive emotion is literally expressed inside the center of your of your spinal column if I don't understand you I can
[45:30] no longer parasympathetically regulate with you we like to think that when we say I don't understand you it's because our mind doesn't follow what the other person is
[45:46] saying I don't think that ever happens I think that when someone says something you try and keep Pace with them and you put the play the pace in your system and you hit play and you
[46:01] find it to be maybe similar to how a mother might might view punk punk rock music or something or something that that that disturbs the system that your immune response is to
[46:15] not understand it it's an immune response but because you live in the Caboose you create this idea that you don't understand what you really what you really mean is
[46:29] that you cannot regulate to it I cannot regulate to the system is what's really happening your signature this is this is pretty cool so when you when you when you uh sign your
[46:47] name it turns out that that that you have to enter into a delicate slow dance where your parasympathetic and your sympathetic atic have to work in tandem that the and this is beautiful because
[47:00] from a very uh early age in our history we started to associate someone being responsible for when someone signs their name why because when you sign your name you demonstrate an ability to have a delicate dance a Harmony between your
[47:15] parasympathetic and sympathetic and you can understand why because a signature is certainly a motor your your motor response gives it gives you the orders how to conduct itself to sign your name mine would be
[47:30] uh uh 80 80° uh up bubble hard stop um -10 degrees down straight down going backwards to send past the a cender
[47:43] baseline another uh another 80 units and I just I just drew a j and that that motor cortex that fires that signature um our motor cortex could simply it knows the shape but if the
[47:57] motor cortex tries to sign its name it loses the calligraphy and more importantly the relaxation that makes the signature real the
[48:07] x is The Reptilian telling I am in charge x marks the spot is The Reptilian signing the name because the delicate balance between the the cerebellum and the basil ganglia hasn't been learned
[48:23] yet when one learns to sign their name they learn to create an integration between these two places otherwise it doesn't even look like the signature keep in mind the signature isn't necessarily shape a
[48:38] signature is calligraphy what does that mean a signature is a Time ballet it's a movement of the hand through time so how fast and how slow you get there is actually even more important than the direction of the
[48:54] shape we've spoken a lot about calories before but if you really want to start to truly understand the low calorie brain the the best way to start is with a bear
[49:09] that size is equal to threat shrink makes you feel comfortable when something shrinks in your eyes you feel comfortable when something grows in
[49:22] your eyes you feel Danger The Only Exception to this is when you outweigh your opponent in the manliness The Art of Manliness which is hilarious that that this meme was put out by The Art of
[49:37] Manliness it shows you that when you encounter a Grizzly you don't run you lay on the ground and you play dead you roll over in a fetal position and you show at your ass but if you counter a black bear it's
[49:51] much different right you shake you yell you scream you you act larger so this meme is telling you to do two different things based on which kind of bear you see then it starts to educate
[50:05] you later in the article about how to even explain to identify which bear is which so why would you have two different reactions to the same animal and it comes back down again to this
[50:16] idea of size why does it come down to size because size equals threat that's why and not only does say size equals threat but when when the threat shrinks you feel comfort and when the the threat
[50:29] grows you feel danger which is why every animal that you know has the ability to hot itself to blow itself up to to to raise its hunches or its cackles or its feathers or its fur and to appear larger
[50:44] because that would be the response to what to regulate its opponent's nervous system why does it regulate it because the opponent feels um
[50:58] advantage and that the threat itself feels that advantage and wants to regulate to it to disallow the advantage and so therefore grows itself in size to compensate which is what that's a symbiotic relationship isn't
[51:11] it that really what's happening is is that your nervous system is responding to the Bear's nervous system just as any other animal will respond to and you develop strategies for for which response is better and these Strate
[51:25] IES are profoundly creative you have to know your opponent you have to know what it is you're you're facing right and a good way to do that is to understand the brain that you're dealing
[51:39] with a rat brain is tuned to the nose it's smell Birds emotions are tuned to their ears believe it or not that what they hear dictates most of their lyic activity in their brain fish entirely
[51:54] different the lyic nature of fish really is more uh responds more to electricity than anything else electricity in the water
[52:06] creates its limic Dimension its limic self to know thyself may not necessarily be to know thy enemy that thy enemy would simply be based on what who has size size is more
[52:20] of a metaphor here but that which is larger would would constitute what something could be we would consider our enemy if we uh outflank our enemy they it's hard for them to become our enemy
[52:32] if they if they do not pose threat this threat is the reptile Loop that there is a giant species of world that require threat to survive that that threat itself reminds the lizard that it's
[52:46] alive and so the reptile Loop is simple and that you will find this inside human beings you will find them running the reptile Loop sometimes and when you recognize this you have the ability to compassionate them very deeply because
[52:59] of how simplistic their Loop is it really becomes very simple and when someone's not online you're going to find the same simplistic Loop running in a lot of people's cases I don't think it runs all the time I think each of us
[53:13] slip in and out of autonomy if that makes sense that some of us may come online for seven minutes every day some of us may come online for seven minutes every year and that our percentage of that
[53:26] truly is based on on our Zen ability in this Dojo right to uh not necessarily grab the reins although certainly that's important but to not let go of them this reptile Loop though is much simpler
[53:40] process number one what is different that the loop is is the iteration that runs every update every time the processor can it comes back and it asks the program the reptile program what do you want I got some time for you what do you want the first thing the reptile
[53:54] says is is what's different and the thalmus has received all of this information and thanks to memory thanks to thought that knows which things are different and so the neurons that are different are able to Fire and that's routed to the reptile
[54:08] and the reptile is able to determine out of the 60 trillion inputs that that we just read which of these 60 trillion inputs are different and now it focuses only on those different things which means you just discovered the largest
[54:21] blind spot that's ever existed inside the reptile mind which is what is different that you find a camouflage in the sameness when dealing with the reptile that you become invisible you've heard of this concept before in Men In
[54:36] Black that these figures that wear this black become invisible to a certain kind of Consciousness and it it it's just discussing the anatomy of the brain that's not even sci-fi we're just telling you how the brain Loops the

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
54:50] reptile will not see you if you do not move number two is this thing that's different remember this is only with what's different is the things that were different the last Loop out of all those things that's different which of them is a threat to
[55:06] me it runs this Loop it tries to determine if it's a threat most most reptiles really aren't able to determine threat or not all they can really determine is what was my system last
[55:20] Loop and what was my system this Loop which one feels better to me better is a very simplistic definition to the reptile though because better isn't built on a future or past machine it's more built on a what was my last reflex machine this comes back to number one
[55:35] what is different the reptile doesn't have a long brain which means the very next signal is going to overwrite the signal that was stored before it this gives the reptile a kind of
[55:47] blindness an ignorant blindness which also makes it Brave which also makes it dangerous this is the essence of white belt the true power of the white belt comes in this ignorance this blind
[56:00] ignorance that gives you the courage to exist after is it threat only then does after it passes these two luxuries does the reptile ask the final most important
[56:14] question and I I stress this it's the final question because the brain is done at this point the reptile has satisfied its entire Consciousness in this third question is that food
[56:25] food is it different a is it a threat b c is it food so the only way the reptile eats is what it shows you the only way a reptile
[56:39] eats is is there something different am I detecting something different here right and is it not a threat only then do I begin my survival
[56:52] system the reptile r has the code you've seen this code in humans around you and the reason why you see this code is because you're watching a human operating on this involuntary AI system factory reset position of the
[57:07] reptile only the first code of the reptile is all pain is evil this is before the neocortex is online pain isn't looked at in a positive way at all therefore all pain is evil why because pain costs calories
[57:22] why does pain cost calories because more action potentials come screaming into the brain and the brain has to burn more calories to process them and so the reptile would prefer a world of no brain
[57:36] calories because that's how it survives it's coldblooded it it preserves every bit of its energy and so it looks for a state that that actually sends its brain less
[57:47] information so all pain becomes evil at that point survival is 100% based on success that all that matters it that's your only success I should say sorry is
[58:01] survival can the reptiles survive doesn't matter if the reptile has a good life or a bad life why does it not matter it doesn't know it doesn't know those things so you find a simplistic attitude in the reptile mind don't you you find
[58:15] one which is will I survive through this and that would only come from this Lower State this this sympathetic state where fear becomes is more of the motivator right where survival itself is that base route that you would need to prove to
[58:30] the system that you will are willing to take over that when you demonstrate to the steering wheel of the AI inside your device that you want to survive too it decides to give you the reins and allow you to drive
[58:44] again so if you see the world to the reptile you're going to find it's got to be low calorie I have to uh feel that I Will Survive the whole time and that any pain I encounter is going
[58:57] to mean failure that I've failed whatever Choice it was that I went to this pain proves that I should not have done it and this is the antithesis of the neocortex the Neo cortex works exactly the opposite of
[59:14] this as you know it is not enough to control your reptile Society demands that you insist it's no longer there lurking in the Shadows you're accepted in
[59:28] society by proving that your reptile is dead and how do you prove that you lie you lie to people over and over to prove that your reptile is dead You Lie by uh
[59:42] expressing uh opportunities where your reptile might show itself and proving that it does not the expression holding your tongue is a is a sympathetic
[59:57] muscle it's a reptile muscle that your neocortex demanding that it can hold its reptile is the equivalent of holding your tongue I think it's safe to say James
[01:00:10] True really doesn't hold his reptile much that I I'm I'm poor at that and many of you are poor at that too and and and this is why you probably have a symbiotic connection with your reptile
[01:00:23] you probably feel sorry pray for it so you don't hold your tongue you allow it to express itself because you want it this freedom because you are looking for a piece of your own there's a certain piece that you want this
[01:00:37] congruence between the sympathetic and parasympathetic and why is it that that always looks like a shaman who comes out and starts speaking starts saying how they feel and this terrifies everyone around them but not the shaman why
[01:00:50] because it's helping the sympathetic system regulate with the parasympathetic system it's helping the person sign their name I.E become the identity of who they
[01:01:06] are the reptile is always sincere because the reptile lacks the budget for deceit deceit is a luxury of mammals when you create an identity
[01:01:24] for yourself you have a timeline and that timeline basically says my name is James I live at this street here's my phone number my social security number is this it I mean those
[01:01:37] are arbitrary but you're constantly repeating yourself to yourself you have to repeat repetition is necessary or else you lose neurons which is why you have thoughts about who you are all the time because you are trying to preserve
[01:01:51] you are bailing out a boat that is filling with with water of Amnesia every day you wake up you bail out and say I am this I am this I am this and you're removing that water to preserve that salt because that salt is the only memory you have of who you are it's all
[01:02:06] potassium tricks it's all it is so the reptile barely has enough timeline for himself so deceit would be something
[01:02:18] that would become impossible impossible deceit required that you find um enough calories to build a completely separate timeline than
[01:02:32] yourself and then deceive it so not only are for you to deceive not only do you need a timeline for yourself and a separate timeline for your deceit and for you to know the difference but you would need a timeline for the person you're
[01:02:45] deceiving which is probably the the the the most caloric thing of all this because the reptile can't even look at their own reflection so how the the [ __ ] could they even compassionate someone else it's
[01:02:58] impossible which proves to you that deceit is the creative act of the mammal it is this secret special magic power that we've developed and we only developed it through this through this time
[01:03:13] [Music] machine bird brain this concept of a bird brain comes in the same way information is expensive
[01:03:24] as a uh bird rehabber the first thing I do when I when I find a bird that's been injured is I cover its eyes why because I've compassionated the bird brain if you haven't compassionated the bird brain it might be that the
[01:03:39] first thing you do when you find a bird unconscious is give it water and food I I appreciate I know that we care but I this always cracks me up it's you're giving a someone in shock
[01:03:53] something that they could only use if they were in a parasympathetic state so when you're giving that bird the water or the food you're you're saying hey I think you're in a parasympathetic say bird which means I think you're cold calm and collected I think you're so cold calm and collected you decide
[01:04:07] there's no threats around you and you open up the possibility of feeding that this luxury of feeding comes out of you only after you've isolated and removed all threat shock problems or pain but
[01:04:21] You' just smacked yourself into a window and truly the all of the uh stress that's going to enter the bird is going to come in through its eyes and through its ears and for the bird to leave the State
[01:04:34] of Shock you would want to remove all eyesight and sound that come into that bird until it's ready for those systems to come back online so to understand the bird brain
[01:04:46] is to really understand some uh Simple Rules right information is expensive data is
[01:04:58] stress all data is stress ignorance is speed what does that mean by the bird knowing less the bird's reactions are
[01:05:12] faster there's not a system of there's not a a half second long train going by and at the very very end is the Caboose right like 15
[01:05:26] milliseconds inside the bird's brain every decision is going to be processed somewhere in there I by the way I don't I don't know what it is I just set 15 milliseconds but if you look at how our Jaws work and everything else and look at how how big a bird is I'm I'm
[01:05:40] guessing maybe it's 1550 milliseconds so that they're time time machine smaller but smaller doesn't necessarily mean weak which kind of brings me to this next point that it's kind of another sidebar but I just think it's important to realize that that
[01:05:53] birds aren't actually stupid the maau on the left has a brain the size of a walnut the monkey on the right I think it's called a maack has a brain the size of a
[01:06:07] lemon so in this case the monkey has a brain that's about five times larger than the maau but the maau actually uh passes uh more sentience tests the maau actually satisfies itself
[01:06:22] as a more intelligent creature and one of the main reasons why is because inside of its neocortex it has more neurons it's not the size of the brain it's the number of neurons that there's just surely more
[01:06:36] neurons inside that system so this concept of larger brain means smarter isn't necessarily true neurons are going to give you resolution this is a great way to think about this if you're into this is this
[01:06:51] concept of 8K versus 4K versus HTMI right and that when you're watching a video you might see or when you're watching a ball game on HDTV or or whatever versus regular TV you're like damn that's a nice picture or damn this
[01:07:05] picture sucks and that the brain would work the same way it has a certain resolution most people don't know this but you uh sadly they go out and they buy a big Monitor and they think well I bought a bigger monitor therefore it's going to it's going to give me better resolution but they buy that biger
[01:07:20] monitor from Amazon they don't realize that Amazon is sending them in 1920 1080 Monitor and just telling and just saying it's 50 in and it is but the 50 in mean that there's only 1,920 pixels between the left side and the right side right so in the same way you can see that you
[01:07:35] can have a bigger monitor but a lower resolution your brain works the same way therefore neurons are pixels neurons are pixels inside of your conscious chalkboard because you're able
[01:07:48] to build a reality out of these pixels right you're building a neurological feature set or uh I'm sorry a model you're building an entire
[01:07:59] miniature inside those neurons because those neurons are pixels voxels would be a better way to call them which are video pixels but but don't worry I won't I won't bore you with stuff like
[01:08:13] that so big isn't always better after you've looked at the Simplicity of the what we just talked about the reptile brain we start to consider the more complex systems of the hind brain this is your Epimetheus your
[01:08:32] past system that you'll notice one of the one of the big weird things that exists inside the hindbrain is social VTO that that most most things with fur
[01:08:45] incorporate some sort of social vetto with each other and that the species itself is a collective it's not a singularity it's a collective and the collective utilizes
[01:08:57] its social structure to survive how does that work one Mouse can learn a maze that Mouse can come back to the to the uh the the nest and within a few hours through some
[01:09:11] sort of weird osmosis none of us understand the other mice understand the maze they solve the maze instantly we it could be that the first thing the mouse does do us come back and say hey guys here's how you solve this
[01:09:26] maze that you're getting ready to take but that would that's you're giving a lot of assumptions that this mouse knows what's coming in the future that even has a future this is why we need to rethink Consciousness ladies and gentlemen this is this is to me this is one of the big
[01:09:40] big big big points that points to this concept of morphic resonance or species resonance that uh there's an epigenetic chemo smell chemo signature that is put off but because you and I have chosen
[01:09:53] into dull our old factory we are missing all of this vital data which is keeping us out of this lamura which I'm fine with I kind of prefer the mystery but it it it stops us from understanding this deeper nature and the
[01:10:08] only way that we can then come come back and congrate or or try and find that place I should say try and find that Zion is through social veto is through social learning is through relying on our species intelligence so that many of us can learn
[01:10:22] collectively no I've said this a million times but the first time man one ran a 4minute mile that same year like six other people did or something and they were like high school kids it's just that easy it's just that easy there's
[01:10:37] something in this Quantum I believe personally that it works with a technology belief that really what's happening is is that is that the high school kid who ran a 4-minute mile now believes that it can be done because he saw someone did it and that's truly what
[01:10:50] unlocks this ability to do it is this belief but that's uh that science is a little bit harder to prove or demonstrate to use atically right now because of the systems we have for proof one of the biggest uh biggest um
[01:11:05] things that shows you just how powerful the hindbrain is when it comes to determining the entire world and I mean warping it in kind of a sick way is um mutilation if you were to open the the
[01:11:19] DSM the diagnostic of mental illness I forget the acronym exactly but it's in its like fifth edition or whatever but you open the dsm5 and you you want to look at well what is what does mutilation really
[01:11:33] mean you end up with a definition that looks like this and I'm reading this because I want you to understand that the hindbrain is pretty pretty Psychopathic nssi is a term for this uh self- injury uh concept of self- injury
[01:11:49] just another word for clinical word for mutilation but what is the DS M5 definition of nssi according to dsm5 nssi diagnostic criteria follows over the past year the per in order for you to mutilate yourself this is the
[01:12:03] criteria okay over the past year person has to for at least five days engage in self- injury with the anticipation that the injury will result in some bodily harm no suicidal intent though the ACT
[01:12:17] is not socially acceptable this is the last sentence I want you to focus on the ACT is not acceptable guys this book tells you that the
[01:12:29] definition of Mutilation is whether or not it's socially acceptable and this is why circumcision is socially acceptable mutilation we don't Define mutilation by
[01:12:43] whether it's moral or not we Define mutilation by whether or not there's a majority opinion about it you can shove metal projectiles through your ears all day long right can
[01:12:56] wear earrings you can mutilate yourself you can cut yourself in certain situations and it's moral socially as long as you only do it for four
[01:13:09] days if you mutilate yourself for four days and 23 hours and 59 minutes and 59 seconds you didn't mutilate yourself it shows you how freaking
[01:13:21] insane the hindbrain works world is and keep in mind that we make this assumption through emotional pedophilia that everyone's online which means a lot of people that are making the rules that you and I both follow are following this
[01:13:34] idea that mutilation is defined by what other people think mutilation is shock therapy is pain medicine and it's actually true I'm not actually against shock therapy do you
[01:13:49] know why because shock therapy is vital and you could look at as a shamanic therapy the shock therapy is is a trip to the shaman Factory that one is entering into a relationship with a shaman of pain
[01:14:04] because it it provides some sort of therapy and I'm stressing this because I want you to know that medicine doesn't fix it shock fixes it pain fixes it because pain itself is the medicine for the hind brain because pain itself is
[01:14:16] rewriting the hind brain when you understand what pain is pain has to flow through the sensory into a central place the psalmist where it is asked is this the worst thing that you've ever
[01:14:30] felt if the worst thing that you've ever felt is this devastatingly guilt-ridden horrible feelings of Abandonment and isolation and just evilness then it means every time that
[01:14:44] you stub your toe every time you bump your elbow your brain has no choice but to Fire and relive the worst experience you've ever had for the sole purpose of determining whether you stubbing your
[01:14:57] toe is worse so your system itself can be overridden simply by having the governors think of these as Governors it's a like a motor term when you turn up or turn down the governor or or the
[01:15:12] idol in your car if if you ever had a car that had a carburetor I should say you could go in and twist this Governor up or down and that that Governor is actually what's dictating how much that
[01:15:24] car Idols or how little that car idols and that that at the very state that you have that's determining where that Governor rate is a state that puts you in sympathetic shock you were no longer a human
[01:15:37] being you're a person living in this endless state of oh my God oh my God oh my God because you're reg living experience that your thalma simply founds finds to be too
[01:15:51] overloading there are way ways to fix this and not only is shock therapy one of them more importantly one of the brilliant things that I've personally seen through virtual reality is the idea
[01:16:04] of reliving an experience through a virtual setting actually having a sematic effect on the sympathetic nerve system that you can experience a car accident and be put
[01:16:19] into that shock I'm telling you about where new inputs come in and and the first thing you have to do is measure well was it worse than the car accident so now you're reliving the car accident and by repeating the car accident in a voluntary state where you sit down and
[01:16:33] you V volitionally choose to reenact the car accident in a virtual setting you are now able to rewrite or restamp those memories and so that the next time that you come in to compare pain to that
[01:16:47] event you now get to compare it not to that event but to the virtual reality reenact of the event that those two blend together and regulate each other because your entire past is not
[01:17:00] somewhere outside of you it ends at the neck it ends at the extent of your limbic moth your neural Moss the seven layered pmus and when you say oh that I I I
[01:17:15] remember that deeply you're literally saying that the neurons at the very bottom of the dendritic uh ocean of this of this Moss the ones at the very very very bottom remember
[01:17:29] this reaction they remember what happened so the Oracle mythology is telling us the whole time we [ __ ] know exactly what's going on exactly how deep or how shallow our brains are
[01:17:44] exactly what it means when I say I turn my back to you as it pertains to this dorsal uh kind of life that we have alive and I swear to you when you see people you can see the rat in their face
[01:17:57] you can see the monkey in their face you can see the reptile in their face and you think it's just you just being a little bit too creative and it's not it's you using your compassion to see inside and let me take a moment to shame
[01:18:12] anyone here who thinks that reptile is a bad word because you are the person who's been helping to destroy Society by shaming this esophagus monster this esophagus tapeworm that
[01:18:26] takes us everywhere in the world so when you find someone in reptile State this is not a condescending term this is a term of oh my God this could not be an easier person to compassionate so why am
[01:18:39] I being such a tool right now by using reptilian in a derogatory way the reptile is a baby does it need to poop does it need to pee does it need
[01:18:51] its mother does it that need a nipple right it there are five things that this baby has and it's menu roster right the reptile is the same and for you to not
[01:19:06] compassionate the reptile is for you to choose to want to separate yourself and hey even that's fine with me nothing wrong with that you're in charge of how big or small your universe is aren't you
[01:19:19] so more toar to you but if you shame the reptile in my Pres I am trying to respect my reptile and I think that it would be a great opportunity for me to defend my reptile if I catch you doing that so there's
[01:19:33] your warning there's a uh a movie I showed a while ago it wasn't a movie but it was a brief clip a while ago I I tried to find it today I apologize I couldn't
[01:19:45] uh it there's a video game conference uh in which this German company is describing desing their walk cycle that they built for their character and he's describing how their human character
[01:20:00] he's carrying like a machine gun and he's just showing you on a map of all these obstacles how their character can learn how to walk keep in mind that that the operator can turn the joystick anywhere but that the character somehow
[01:20:13] has to place its feet in just the right way to match the the movement of the joystick in a certain direction and if there's like cans and and boxes and crevices and bars and and and different
[01:20:27] things the the the the programming the the game company guy who's giving this demonstration is explaining to you to to the other programmers in the audience how they were able to do that he said
[01:20:40] this was a problem you all know this is a problem none of you I've seen your game engines none of you have solved this and here we've solved this and I'm going to tell you how which is pretty cool of him to even share this

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
[00:00] there's the parasympathetic there's the sympathetic and there is the anic and at the bottom at the base of this is this this enteric uh Kingdom it's a kingdom that that rules from the
[00:13] esophagus the stomach the intestines the pancreas the gallbladder this this system in you is basically a tapeworm that's been
[00:24] saddled by a larger organism and that larger organism is is your uh dolinic uh outer shell technically your esophagus is and
[00:38] your your stomach is its own living creature it's not even technically it it has its own neurons uh there's a lot of neurons in your stomach uh a lot and more more than
[00:51] in your heart in fact and that that this this neurological system is only recently been recognized as a brain and by recognizing it as a brain it becomes more than fair and more than
[01:04] adequate for us to recognize it as an an uh its own entity and I think the best way to understand this is is is three different kingdoms there are three kingdoms inside of you and at the base of this kingdom
[01:17] is is this cic Kingdom and if you can picture your stomach with a saddle on it and that saddle is your bone structure and all the other outer organs that are relying on that horse right they're relying on
[01:31] that Steed to uh uh carry them through the terrain safely and by that terrain technically the ground in which this horse uh carries you would be the food that you pass through your your membrane
[01:46] and as you place food inside the top of your Taurus and it and it exits out the the the bottom of your Taurus what you're really doing is giving a foot pad for this horse to
[01:57] walk and so time it's self from this if you look at what time is to this enic Kingdom time is the passage of food through its Bay that food is birthed to it from some
[02:12] unknown source outside of it and that this food is past and that that the journey requires that this anic stomach uh choose what it what it wants to learn along this journey it is not able to dictate the journey to itself it does
[02:27] not have full control over the destiny of what food will come to it its only power lies in what it chooses to digest and this should be familiar to you because it should remind you of you
[02:40] yourself that the chemical makeup that is the world the weather the system of time the system of everything that we have is its own passage of Road and that you your experiences or
[02:54] feat that have no choice but to carry yourself through this journey and so you can compassionate this enic system is both autonomous but also Bound in fact it's bound by you you were the
[03:08] ruler of this inic system you you alone are responsible for the torture or the love that that inic systems going to receive as you give it yeast as you give
[03:20] it salt as you give it sugar you are uh acting as a God you are a bow the first definition of of God came from the idea of bad
[03:33] weather and it would be wise to consider the cic kingdom as uh victims of your weather and that the weather you pass it is directly related to the protein chains or the lack of protein chains
[03:47] that you choose to distribute down the river it's River of time which is your your membrane so separating yourself from your enic
[04:01] system and seeing it as its own separate entity answers a lot of questions about addiction diet Comfort what food does to you why you have a certain passion for food but maybe that food might make you
[04:15] feel a different way and why there's a uh the the that lack of Harmony sometimes that might exist is actually uh quite natural when you understand that this is its own kingdom that this
[04:27] is its separate um um separate place and for the first time ever if if you if if you've never seen it this way for the first time ever you would begin to
[04:39] compassionate A system that you rule over that you you you would begin to extend or bestow this idea of giving witness to this creature itself and that the opening of that witness would would
[04:54] actually leave the pressure on its system to dump or refuse Sarat oent to you that it's its only voice that it has to communicate to you is this
[05:08] pleasure and the pleasure that you get from food is much more profound than you think and the pleasure that you derive from food is also chalk full of the humans that actually prepared it a homecooked meal is a home-cooked meal
[05:21] because it holds other kinds of energy and that the space between the notes of every song is no different than the space between the smells of every taste and that this space can be packed full of
[05:33] this intangible thing we call Consciousness so in that space in that intangible there is the ability to communicate with a creature that's living inside your body that you as Osiris would have this
[05:50] underling Kingdom living underneath you above that system relying on it is the sympathetic system your eyes your heart your lungs your stomach your intestines your joints and your skin the system would be nothing without
[06:05] without its horse the system is its own kingdom its own Consciousness your your heart has its own beat your breath has its own Rhythm right and that these rhythms and
[06:20] beats go on regardless of whether you're conscious or not whether you're sentient or not whether you're stupid or not that these systems have fail safe AI living
[06:32] inside them that automatically run and operate there is simple as a thermostat in your home but at the same time they have their own Matrix of emotions desires and what they want those two are
[06:47] are also imprisoned in a way inside this higher system this parasympathetic system you know what it's probably not exactly that way
[07:00] I'm sorry I'm amending this as I'm speaking really in a lot of ways the the the parasympathetic is almost a slave to the sympathetic but in a way of sort of justifying what's happening and it makes sense that I might be confused about
[07:14] this at first because we get the same confused about Washington DC that that we think Washington DC is in charge but but really the role of the politician as we just discussed recently is is not
[07:27] necessarily to change po policy or to create policy but simply to explain to the people that the policy that's already there is is not going anywhere and to give reasons and excuses to labor
[07:40] the blame of that is really an inflammatory response so if you really look at who holds the keys to your body I think you're really looking in a sympathetic place and that sympathetic place you're
[07:53] going to find out tonight is your spirit animal that spirit animal it's certainly wise I'm not asking you not to trust it but I'm also asking you to consider that your spirit animal needs
[08:07] you just as much as you you need your spirit animal and this might be something that you're not used to hearing because you feel that the spirit animal is sort of a a one-way
[08:20] Street and it's funny be we have that same false relationship with our inic system too our what we digest what we choose to eat as we talked about last time the uh
[08:33] sexual arousal is an involuntary process not necessarily controlled by your conscious mind and I I spoke briefly about how funny that seems to be when you if we believe the idea that we only
[08:47] evolved from this place because we were uh ponum fornicating ourselves into a fetish of survival that creating a Consciousness that would not allow us to turn on or off off our uh sexual
[09:01] activity would might actually make it harder for us to reproduce which gives us I think deeper Clues into not only why you're here but more importantly how you're here which is the time machines that we
[09:15] discussed last time this idea of there being a forbrain and a and a hindbrain operating and so the lessons we learned last time become even more complicated
[09:28] when we start to understand that that limic communication is a Prana economy a word we we a phrase we use a lot to talk about but to break down this pra economy you you can think of it as a chemical
[09:41] reaction a a reaction of several chemicals placed into uh the same space the same environment and that uh if you understood chemistry enough you would be able to predict I.E compassionate what those chemicals are going to do once
[09:56] they find each other once they discover that each other exist exists and once they seek out the symbiosis the symbiosis appears to have no free will when you look at chemistry you might want to say oh these chemicals
[10:10] oil and water have no free will they are bound to the idea that they are in opposition I I I would tend to agree with that I would tend to say yeah water and oil don't have free will and we
[10:23] might even argue well yeah it's because they're not alive or or we might argue that that their time machine hasn't come online yet and there is an autopilot built into all of your proteins all of your amino acids that would act just
[10:37] like chemistry and that you would automatically have a base root response a template response that allows you to exist and survive in this world that you would not be born
[10:50] still and remain still until your Consciousness formed that that would lead to you being thrown away and so you've had to develop certain system sys that were would persist regardless of whether or not you were
[11:03] online and the uh tendency for us to uh commit this phrase emotional pedophilia I talk about it really shines itself true here when we when we think and insist that everyone around us is
[11:17] online and this insistence that everyone is online is typically where we lose our compassion and our safety which loses us this topshed tier Kingdom
[11:32] called parasympathetic which is part of what what we're learning today so this pra economy before before the soul comes online and even while the soul is online there are these three basic rules and
[11:45] these three basic rules are everyone sheds everyone eats and ultimately everyone agrees that every chemical that you mix in a vile agrees and it may not look like it agree you may say oh these don't
[12:00] agree at all they're they're volatile in fact but actually no they they are in agreement it's you and I that created the idea that Civilization would always be tame kind and polite it's nature and chemistry that's been telling you the
[12:13] whole time you're not actually paying attention and so the pra economy that develops really would would have nothing to do with how Adept someone is and it really it would more have to do is how online someone
[12:27] is when you come online you end up rendering your own free will I believe but until you do there is a base free will that is built for you that comes out of the factory that just simply allows you to
[12:40] survive so this is at the heart of pra economy and and that you yourself or are subject to this pra economy and and you it's sort of a luxury in a sense because you can go below below deck tend to
[12:53] something else and and give up steering the boat but you've got autopilot on and the Rudder is constantly keeping you at your vector it would be impossible for you to
[13:06] survive without this kind of system so you in fact are a trinity and there's really nothing nothing more to argue about that that you see it working in these three
[13:20] kingdoms so everyone has a neocortex but it was Sapien sapiens that turned it into a time machine that that homo sapen said I want to turn my cortex into
[13:33] a violent tumor of growth I want it to explode and that that was such a a massive change from the standard set of of of reptile of vertebrae and that that massive change
[13:48] for whatever reason I I I think it's hard to to not um want to explain that that this was somehow manipulated on purpose because For What whatever specific reason this same Homo Sapien
[14:01] after taking a a pretty abrupt 180 degree turn in its species and actually flipping its uh flipping it its hippocampus to where the tail of its brain actually started to point forward
[14:15] much like a scorpion's tail and that for the first time we began to insist that this neocortex is more important than we think and so homo sapien takes it one more step he he he doubles down and he
[14:29] grows a growth on top of that growth and for the first time the neocortex explodes before it explodes you'll see here in this illustration just a brief a brief summary of all the other animals that have this forbrain as we talked about last time
[14:44] the forbrain you could look at as your future machine or or the or the past machine so every animal still has their seed and time but the size of the forebrain could could be said to roughly
[14:57] uh roughly point to the size of their future time machine going to contradict this just just only slightly when we talk about bird brains but it's more just to dissolve a uh a common misconception we
[15:10] have about how how dumb we think birds are um oops need to turn that off so everyone has this neocortex which means actually everyone has this sense of
[15:25] self that the neocortex really really would probably atrophy if it didn't have something to do in fact if we get to the thalmus tonight I I'll show you what happens if there is nothing to do and so the neocortex that's busy is the
[15:40] neocortex that insists it needs more space it needs more resources to produce when it comes to looking at at how far you live in time that the this is the map that I prepared to show you just how that
[15:56] works that there is a reptilian Underlord from the future not an Overlord but an actual Underlord and this un Underlord from the future is only there because you yourself are are are too far away from it that you're in
[16:11] the past but this reptilian Underlord is is on the precipice on The Cutting Edge of present and you can see this there's a
[16:23] 14 millisecond reflex from the Jaw a 30 millisecond ref flects from the blink notice that your mouth Works faster than your eyes I believe this gives you a clue over what this reptilian Underlord
[16:37] finds more important or more importantly finds more reliable or more trustable for his survival and so we I've got these listed for you sequentially because you can see his jaw is first his blink is second at
[16:51] 90 milliseconds he can move his head that even before his head he's got this jaw reflex which has to be uh 10 times faster the mouth reflex is 10 times faster than thought
[17:05] itself which is why when you this is why pigeons uh die when they eat rice at weddings the reptile brain swallows it doesn't say should I eat that it swallows it doesn't have a an
[17:20] opportunity to ask two of those luxurious questions should and even the question itself is it do I have a choice in what I do so what I'm trying to explain really delicately
[17:33] here is is that the fact that you live in the future the fact that you have this Prometheus is is literally the only reason why you even have free will that that this this weird stretchy rubber band relationship that you've
[17:47] developed with time gives you this window for a Quantum of possibilities to exists and it's very much a Quantum because you compute all of your possibilities and every single system in your body Believe It or Not takes these
[18:01] possibilities and fires them to one place called The thelus it sends them to a specific place so every single separate organism gets to put their two cents into their system and it's the
[18:14] thalmus itself that acts as this uh Bridal chamber this consecration that who will the prince Mary will determine the future of the Kingdom but every single Suitor from
[18:29] every single country will be sending their Hope Chest in their offerings into the phalus but the thalmus itself will only choose to mount with one to choose to bond with one and
[18:43] so the decision process that you see is very much the same thing you have a Quantum a million tude of decisions that you could make but all of those are converged in a Quantum inside the thalmus which means that the
[18:56] thalmus collapses reality it collapses reality what you and I call reality I should say into the present it takes all of the suggestions from the past and all of the suggestions
[19:12] from the future and conveys them into this inner chamber this sacred chamber that's literally what that word thalmus means this sacred pillow and that night something is
[19:26] consecrated something your distance from the thalmus is directly proportional to your rank inside the body if you were second in command you
[19:39] will only have one neuron jump between you and the phalus if you were third in command you will have three neurological jumps between you and the thalmus every one of these neurological jumps is an opportunity for the bureaucracy around
[19:53] you to override your vote that you send your tribute to the thalmus and you say this is so important that we swallow this this round Taurus that you see with sprinkles on top we have determined to
[20:07] be a donut and and the the delicate nature of our kingdom rest on you swallowing that dut right now the joy it will bring us as a
[20:20] people will allow us to shine forever and the thelist is like wow that's a pretty strong case you make right and there is a bishop a queen of swords that can override every decision every
[20:36] Everything the bishop says The Rook says the Knight says can be overridden by this one sacred sacred queen that has not one jump from the
[20:48] thalmus but actually vetos the thalmus we've spoken about this before and it's the nose the old factory system itself the very system that you chose in the top of your mouth to turn
[21:01] off when you were born you shut that off it's been an atropy ever since what you think is smell is actually a passive sonar that you used to have an active sonar I apologize if you don't know this
[21:14] but a submarine has the ability for active sonar which is you might have heard the symbol of ping and there's a ping sound that's sent and that that ping is is the sending of a signal that
[21:27] it active sonar will come back and they will listen to how long it took that ping to arrive versus a passive sonar which is not to send a ping but simply to listen to listen to Listen to
[21:39] listen and that paive sonar is the parabola the the peripheral vision and the macular Vision you staring directly at something would be this sense of of active sonar
[21:54] to your queen the old factory sister system it has more power than every piece combined she has all of their powers combined doesn't she with this veto what it really does is give her the
[22:09] ability to absorb the power of the bishop to go in diagonal the power of the Rook to go horizontal or vertical the power of the Knight to literally jump over pawns to achieve things
[22:21] because she holds the veto over all of them so she has all of these skills so when you start to understand who and what you are you you were a nothing more
[22:33] than a conglomerate of Symbio uh symbiosis this is a scary concept to the mind as it comes online which is why like a jet ski we have the safety mechanism built in which which keeps us
[22:47] offline until you finally approach the cockpit of this ship that you've were born inside of and slowly grew up in on your your own and you one day you wander through this Millennium Falcon and you
[23:02] turn right down this Corridor and you go down these steps and suddenly you're in this giant viewer window and you see outside and there's a steering wheel and there's a
[23:13] navigation and you suddenly control this ship and it's a scary Endeavor could be terrifying right and so so too is this concept of when and how or even if we come
[23:28] [Music] online and as I said once you come online one of the scary things is really doing the math and understanding that my mouth has 10 times the power of
[23:40] my arms that my mouth is 10 times ahead of myself of my arms and time which kind of shows you that you were screaming through time the reptile screams through time with his racing goggles on with his
[23:53] jaw first his eyes second his head third his neck neck fourth his shoulders fifth his arms his legs and at the very end trailing like a pathetic overweight cross country runner
[24:08] in eth grade not referring to anyone except for maybe someone me anyway what way at the behind way behind everyone else after the girls race is started is this little neocortex at 500
[24:22] milliseconds the very very end of the line the Caboose of the train is you that you yourself are the Caboose and it's so terrifying that you're that you're convincing yourself
[24:36] that that you control the train and that the tracks are yours and that they're laid down be until you slowly see through the veil of Hades and slowly uncover the fact that this is how it
[24:49] works that this is the system and this startle reflex in milliseconds is really showing you this reptilian Underlord Lord and more importantly where you stand on his chain of
[25:05] command the Triune brain I'm sure is a system or concept many of you hopefully maybe have heard if not um I'll just remind you but this reptilian inner brain this limic brain this uh second
[25:19] brain which is what what we were calling last time the the hindbrain or or Epimetheus and the neocortex is Prometheus so The Reptilian is the now the lyic brain is the past the neocortex
[25:32] is the future but I really want to hammer home a couple more analogies because I think it'll really help you build a neurology to understanding these different kingdoms one of which is that we are looking at the ID the ego and the
[25:47] super ego that the ID is this reptilian part of you that the ego is this lyic part of you and the super ego is this neocortex part of you and that that if you're not even 26 years old you don't even have a super
[26:01] ego and I think right now before lamura hits we live in this Dark Age time where we treat everyone as if they have a neocortex by the time they're
[26:14] 18 and it's just simply not really dealing with the same species at that point the same thing is reflected in the concept of id ego and super ego are kind of too esoteric for you or if they're just too general or
[26:29] you don't even like that framework I think you could also look at this as The Reptilian is the eye the lyic brain is the am and the neocortex is the string name uh string name meaning whatever your
[26:42] name is if if I was just talking to you I would have put your name here but whatever your name is would be that that last piece as we learned it comes online your name comes online probably a reason
[26:56] why Jewish Native American both have this tradition deep in their past of when you turn 13 you you become something your neocortex is half online right it's half the work has been done
[27:10] and you choose your name you you choose this concept of of who you are before you move forward so inside of you this red part is a joystick in a plane right it's a a jet fighter and there's this joystick
[27:25] and it's got the throttle and it's got the fire button and you could see it right there you literally wrap your fingers around this thing and wrap your thumb on top of it and that that's your motor cortex it moves your flaps it moves every flap it

27:38] it it turns on every Thruster and it fires every bullet everyone including the sexual uh number one and number two right number one number two and number three all of those systems are are fired
[27:51] by that same core and that same core is living 480 milliseconds ahead of you that's a long time that's a long long long time to live ahead of
[28:03] you to remind you again the past this hindbrain it's looking back the Yellow Part the future this neocortex it's bent forward it's looking forward in the present this this joystick in the yid I want to take this moment though to point
[28:18] out that that everything about you and your essence is actually built into this hindbrain and forebrain and those those things both happen to stop at the neck which means that the future and the
[28:31] past are only in your head that you you you tricky tricky bastard that that you've been painting the future and the past so well in your head this whole time that you you may
[28:44] not actually realize that they do not exist outside of you and the answer is hey guess what they they do not exist outside of you you made them you made these things appear this is your quantum you were your own
[28:58] Quantum Galaxy right and you're able to convolve the universe you see and to collapse your wave of possibility into what you believe will happen ultimately what your will is but we're still learning to navigate
[29:12] our will much like a fighter pilot learns to uh handle the G forces of his own his own stick and until he's ready until he knows he won't faint Under Pressure there's only going to be so
[29:24] fast he's going to go inside this ship to Zink this home even further if you've ever paid attention at all when you turn on a computer that the first thing that happens when you turn on a computer is your bios boots
[29:38] up your bios and it looks like this black screen on the bottom right doesn't necessarily say American Meat Trends but that's a pretty popular one but sometimes you'll see energy star or Dell or something else but it's it's the bio
[29:52] booting up and if you read that you you could click on Tab and you could enter into the operating system of your reptilian core and you could change your time clock you could change uh the settings on your RAM chips you could you
[30:05] could assign new primary hard drives and and literally tell it where your body is and there's these low-level processes and it's kind of tricky and scary and most people don't like to even go into their bios because talking to the reptile is serious business it's not a fun activity it's not a friendly
[30:19] interface in fact why because it doesn't have the luxury of this past and present it has to be spoken to and very direct ways where you can only enter numbers like one through four you know different choices like that it's very
[30:33] simplistic above the BIOS though right after that bios window boots up you notice something fancier comes on your operating system comes on and if you're on Mac or if you're on Windows or if you're looking at your cell phone you're watching that operating system come on
[30:48] and that that operating system is really your hindbrain I say that because most operating systems or every operating system that's going to survive has built into it a dummy proof system that tries
[31:02] to make it harder for the driver to destroy it that through password memory through hey are you sure you want to throw this away to hey man are you sure you want to empty your trash can to hey your firewall's not on or are you sure you want to see this site or you sure you
[31:16] want to download this program that from the very system that the hindbrain comes on comes a system of doubt that the past brings you the ability to doubt the now to doubt the future to doubt what might happen to
[31:30] someone and that that doubt comes from this very idea of learning to test pain and that pain teaches us doubt and doubt teaches us resilience to change it doesn't teach us anything else but just
[31:44] to try something so with the very heart of every motivation you have comes this gift that came to you which is doubt doubt in doubt in the present doubt in in your your insistence that if you do nothing everything will will be okay and
[31:58] so all systems come online from there this is your operating system and as you're using your operating system you notice that inside your operating system there are several programs you can run several of them and you can open up calculator you can open
[32:13] up your browser and literally go anywhere you can open up Photoshop paint some pictures and all these applications are simply identities and that you yourself the identity that you think you are your name your string name is the application
[32:28] or the game that you were running inside the operating system which is resting on top of the BIOS which booted the computer and literally tells the machine inside where everything goes this is your motor
[32:42] cortex the thalmus is the only one that has the key to communicate with the motor cortex where the motor cortex can trust it and so all these decisions are collapsed through your operating system
[32:54] into your bios and you hear this magnetic needle right or erase right and erase right and erase a piece of silicon inside your body inside your hard
[33:10] drive the I and the am would be the noun and the verb wouldn't it and that the I the noun the sense of I develops a sense of am as we talked about only by having a sense of memory and only through
[33:24] memory do we develop the past which basically proves that the am exists inside the lyic self the limic self is the amness of you The Reptilian self is the eyess of
[33:38] you the eyess is pure reflex the amness is pure oh [ __ ] did that hurt or did that not hurt and above this is your name you can see different systems how they each run I won't read them all here but the
[33:53] reptilian complex run in the basil ganglia the basil basically just a a a simple word for an area of the brain this Gangi is technically a misnomer um
[34:05] it's should be actually called a nuclei but it was named before our anatomy got straight but basically just a collection a collection in a space so The Reptilian is a collection of reflexes that are centralized into a
[34:20] space that you and I start to call a system and that you and I would only know that it's a system because we have a past and a future right that without the past and future we wouldn't even know it's a system which is why I'm trying to tell you and convey that the eye doesn't know it's a system the eye
[34:35] does not know its separation from the world you show a reptile its reflection in the mirror and with the exception of the few idios syncratic cases or or uh
[34:48] sorry that's the wrong word but but there's a few people that that love their lizard so much that they insist that this doesn't happen but but most animals will attack their own reflection if kind of terrifying terrifying because they don't
[35:00] have an the I has no am to relate to it has no idea to even learn about itself cannot learn about yourself and until you have this memory to build this idea of test response test response test
[35:14] response every every reaction you have to what you think is consciousness really boils down to you testing whether something is conscious or not how do you test something you secretly manipulate it into making it self adjust to
[35:29] something that makes it more comfortable what if I was to tell you that every conversation you have is that you pushing someone into a state of of discomfort and that the reason why you're pushing someone into a state of discomfort is because you want to know
[35:44] if they are alive so what do you say you say hello there how is well James how is Hello there a state of discomfort because all of us are socially connected through through our inner ear and through the
[35:59] inner ear you've been trained in a process where if you hear something you answer and you you physically feel itchy if you don't you feel discomfort if you don't so when someone says hello there they're actually putting you on the spot
[36:12] they're actually saying prove to me that you exist prove to me that you are alive it's a challenge question is what it is and so you answer back you answer back proving that you exist why why do you prove that because
[36:26] just demonstrated that you have the ability to accept something from them and respond to it which really means you're just showing that you are reactive that your your reactions are
[36:40] online right and this this defines the relationship that they have with you from the moment you prove that by saying hello there right now the system recalls itself because you've set up a protocol
[36:54] you just like a web browser when I go to HTT tpsg google.com I tell Google hello I'd like to establish a tcpi connection with you through a secure socket layer do you agree hello there is hello I'd
[37:07] like to establish an asynchronous connection between the two of us using the protocol of English do you agree and his answer hello is that agreement both of those Agreements are
[37:20] YouTu now forging a reality a wormhole between universe and universe and that worm only exists because of this relationship this
[37:34] Trinity this Trinity that exists so you develop things like jealousy one of the most beautiful emotions you want to know why jealousy exists in the world because there are people that do not know that they they
[37:49] exist and jealousy reminds them wait a minute a person that deserves more and this jealousy I feel is the inspiration that I have that I deserve this thing that that I do not that I do not have
[38:01] right now it's the most beautiful motivation jealousy is it shows you that you have lack and the only reason why you have lack is because you found a shell that was big enough to fill your
[38:15] potential and that your potential has to get off its ass right that's what jealousy is so all of these all of these uh emotions we have are the
[38:28] limic systems growing exercising themselves right proving that they have relevance in this world which is really the essence of am I am I am I am I
[38:41] relevate I relevate I relevate right I am relevant to myself to others around me I am I am so this Trinity gives you three different
[38:54] kingdoms to trade with you trade with these kingdoms don't you you're who you think you truly are is really an a uh a like a some sort of Diplomat and you're opening trade routes
[39:09] into each of these kingdoms that are autonomous that their economies don't necessarily need you that you have to do what they have to do you have to prove your relevance to them by saying I'm online now and the first thing The Reptilian says is no you're not dude you're going to go to bed or you're
[39:23] drinking a beer or you're not you you don't know that pure dangers of of you know of hypothermia you're not even wearing a jacket and that slowly you build Authority you build confidence inside these kingdoms by showing up for
[39:37] them by relying on them by recognizing them by analizing them and by freaking talking to them by talking to your stomach by talking to your lyic self by acknowledging your jealousy as a
[39:52] as a beautiful sign of a Hermit grab who's just found a bigger place to live all of these reactions are giving you opportunities to respond to yourself and every time you respond to yourself you're given more Privileges and one day you'll notice the
[40:06] reptilian Overlord has given you the keys itself to the very cockpit that drives your body and that's that's a special relationship and what happens then the selft Talk
[40:19] Stops you become a different kind of antenna and your life uh your life changes just from there you might call this a sidebar but I really I really want to hit this home I I briefly mentioned this last time
[40:36] this idea of of these postures de decorticate and de de decerebrate I've been singing decerebrate Good Times decorate to try
[40:48] and remember but it's like decorate oh decorticate yeah I want you to look at these postures that the the if you could fire every reflex in the body right if you could pinch all the nerves that you
[41:02] know send in a reflex I think that by pinching those nerves what you're really doing is you're demanding now that that you're shutting off the territorial authority
[41:16] of the hindbrain and the forebrain and by shutting off those territories your identity is reduced to your inner brain to this Reptilian Brain and so the The Reflex action of
[41:31] the body when it's in a state of of this this decortication if that's a word or or decerebration I I hope that you can see from these pictures that I've shown is really just expressing the the true
[41:45] nature of who it is that this posture is the self living inside this inner brain living inside this edness the bios the body takes the shape of the BIOS
[41:59] because the body is the BIOS right all the reflexes have been triggered and so you become the actual shape of your Consciousness right and that that's what this is this is a cross-section of your of your spinal
[42:19] [Music] column and when you deal with the world you're going to have negative emotions that come in and you're going to have positive emotions that that come in and you're going to send out negative emotions and you're going to send out
[42:31] positive emotions and what those really mean I think could be reduced to the words dorsal and ventral and that this idea I turn my back on you is the Oracle of Mythology explaining to you that it knows exactly
[42:47] how the body works that when you were in a parasympathetic State you open your lines of communication to ventral communication and vental communication would give you
[42:58] this ability to share and by sharing you are now reading the faces of others in the room and by reading the faces of others in the room you are becoming susceptible to all of their emotions because you tap into their face and you
[43:12] create this HTTP connection just as you do as Google and you actually don't get to dictate what Google's going to send you and they could play you some of the most obscene information or propaganda you could see and there's really no way
[43:25] that you could unsee that because of the nature of how we work and because of that your body has to have these really strong mechanisms that are built in where if if the body receives enough of
[43:40] a negative signal that causes it enough stress the body will switch into dorsal mode and dedicate all of its resources to its back so when something turns its back on you it's actually saying I'm
[43:54] only going to watch you like a hawk now I'm only going to become dorsal really really means I'm only going to become a a furent or
[44:05] sensory right I'm only going to become receptive much like a a a uh when a predator finds a rabbit the rabbit becomes receptive and simply watches the
[44:19] Predator from a dorsal place the rabbit will not communicate because its vental system the front of its spinal column says no no we do not engage in the luxury of communication because this is
[44:33] a dangerous situation our dorsal has taken over it needs all of these things which is why our motor our eer systems that run down our spine because they come down our ventral Pathways we can sometimes faint we lose the ability to
[44:48] even move the reason why we cannot move is because our dorsal system is overloaded and is running things this is a safety mechanism it's a safety response it's actually you your body doing a good job
[45:03] which is why it's so important for you to come online because when you're online you're going to be able to give your vental system the confidence it needs when when it's needed same for your dorsal too
[45:16] so the intrinsic nature of reality itself as being a negative or a positive emotion is literally expressed inside the center of your of your spinal column if I don't understand you I can
[45:30] no longer parasympathetically regulate with you we like to think that when we say I don't understand you it's because our mind doesn't follow what the other person is
[45:46] saying I don't think that ever happens I think that when someone says something you try and keep Pace with them and you put the play the pace in your system and you hit play and you
[46:01] find it to be maybe similar to how a mother might might view punk punk rock music or something or something that that that disturbs the system that your immune response is to
[46:15] not understand it it's an immune response but because you live in the Caboose you create this idea that you don't understand what you really what you really mean is
[46:29] that you cannot regulate to it I cannot regulate to the system is what's really happening your signature this is this is pretty cool so when you when you when you uh sign your
[46:47] name it turns out that that that you have to enter into a delicate slow dance where your parasympathetic and your sympathetic atic have to work in tandem that the and this is beautiful because
[47:00] from a very uh early age in our history we started to associate someone being responsible for when someone signs their name why because when you sign your name you demonstrate an ability to have a delicate dance a Harmony between your
[47:15] parasympathetic and sympathetic and you can understand why because a signature is certainly a motor your your motor response gives it gives you the orders how to conduct itself to sign your name mine would be
[47:30] uh uh 80 80° uh up bubble hard stop um -10 degrees down straight down going backwards to send past the a cender
[47:43] baseline another uh another 80 units and I just I just drew a j and that that motor cortex that fires that signature um our motor cortex could simply it knows the shape but if the
[47:57] motor cortex tries to sign its name it loses the calligraphy and more importantly the relaxation that makes the signature real the
[48:07] x is The Reptilian telling I am in charge x marks the spot is The Reptilian signing the name because the delicate balance between the the cerebellum and the basil ganglia hasn't been learned
[48:23] yet when one learns to sign their name they learn to create an integration between these two places otherwise it doesn't even look like the signature keep in mind the signature isn't necessarily shape a
[48:38] signature is calligraphy what does that mean a signature is a Time ballet it's a movement of the hand through time so how fast and how slow you get there is actually even more important than the direction of the
[48:54] shape we've spoken a lot about calories before but if you really want to start to truly understand the low calorie brain the the best way to start is with a bear
[49:09] that size is equal to threat shrink makes you feel comfortable when something shrinks in your eyes you feel comfortable when something grows in
[49:22] your eyes you feel Danger The Only Exception to this is when you outweigh your opponent in the manliness The Art of Manliness which is hilarious that that this meme was put out by The Art of
[49:37] Manliness it shows you that when you encounter a Grizzly you don't run you lay on the ground and you play dead you roll over in a fetal position and you show at your ass but if you counter a black bear it's
[49:51] much different right you shake you yell you scream you you act larger so this meme is telling you to do two different things based on which kind of bear you see then it starts to educate
[50:05] you later in the article about how to even explain to identify which bear is which so why would you have two different reactions to the same animal and it comes back down again to this
[50:16] idea of size why does it come down to size because size equals threat that's why and not only does say size equals threat but when when the threat shrinks you feel comfort and when the the threat
[50:29] grows you feel danger which is why every animal that you know has the ability to hot itself to blow itself up to to to raise its hunches or its cackles or its feathers or its fur and to appear larger
[50:44] because that would be the response to what to regulate its opponent's nervous system why does it regulate it because the opponent feels um
[50:58] advantage and that the threat itself feels that advantage and wants to regulate to it to disallow the advantage and so therefore grows itself in size to compensate which is what that's a symbiotic relationship isn't
[51:11] it that really what's happening is is that your nervous system is responding to the Bear's nervous system just as any other animal will respond to and you develop strategies for for which response is better and these Strate
[51:25] IES are profoundly creative you have to know your opponent you have to know what it is you're you're facing right and a good way to do that is to understand the brain that you're dealing
[51:39] with a rat brain is tuned to the nose it's smell Birds emotions are tuned to their ears believe it or not that what they hear dictates most of their lyic activity in their brain fish entirely
[51:54] different the lyic nature of fish really is more uh responds more to electricity than anything else electricity in the water
[52:06] creates its limic Dimension its limic self to know thyself may not necessarily be to know thy enemy that thy enemy would simply be based on what who has size size is more
[52:20] of a metaphor here but that which is larger would would constitute what something could be we would consider our enemy if we uh outflank our enemy they it's hard for them to become our enemy
[52:32] if they if they do not pose threat this threat is the reptile Loop that there is a giant species of world that require threat to survive that that threat itself reminds the lizard that it's
[52:46] alive and so the reptile Loop is simple and that you will find this inside human beings you will find them running the reptile Loop sometimes and when you recognize this you have the ability to compassionate them very deeply because
[52:59] of how simplistic their Loop is it really becomes very simple and when someone's not online you're going to find the same simplistic Loop running in a lot of people's cases I don't think it runs all the time I think each of us
[53:13] slip in and out of autonomy if that makes sense that some of us may come online for seven minutes every day some of us may come online for seven minutes every year and that our percentage of that
[53:26] truly is based on on our Zen ability in this Dojo right to uh not necessarily grab the reins although certainly that's important but to not let go of them this reptile Loop though is much simpler
[53:40] process number one what is different that the loop is is the iteration that runs every update every time the processor can it comes back and it asks the program the reptile program what do you want I got some time for you what do you want the first thing the reptile
[53:54] says is is what's different and the thalmus has received all of this information and thanks to memory thanks to thought that knows which things are different and so the neurons that are different are able to Fire and that's routed to the reptile
[54:08] and the reptile is able to determine out of the 60 trillion inputs that that we just read which of these 60 trillion inputs are different and now it focuses only on those different things which means you just discovered the largest
[54:21] blind spot that's ever existed inside the reptile mind which is what is different that you find a camouflage in the sameness when dealing with the reptile that you become invisible you've heard of this concept before in Men In
[54:36] Black that these figures that wear this black become invisible to a certain kind of Consciousness and it it it's just discussing the anatomy of the brain that's not even sci-fi we're just telling you how the brain Loops the

54:50] reptile will not see you if you do not move number two is this thing that's different remember this is only with what's different is the things that were different the last Loop out of all those things that's different which of them is a threat to
[55:06] me it runs this Loop it tries to determine if it's a threat most most reptiles really aren't able to determine threat or not all they can really determine is what was my system last
[55:20] Loop and what was my system this Loop which one feels better to me better is a very simplistic definition to the reptile though because better isn't built on a future or past machine it's more built on a what was my last reflex machine this comes back to number one
[55:35] what is different the reptile doesn't have a long brain which means the very next signal is going to overwrite the signal that was stored before it this gives the reptile a kind of
[55:47] blindness an ignorant blindness which also makes it Brave which also makes it dangerous this is the essence of white belt the true power of the white belt comes in this ignorance this blind
[56:00] ignorance that gives you the courage to exist after is it threat only then does after it passes these two luxuries does the reptile ask the final most important
[56:14] question and I I stress this it's the final question because the brain is done at this point the reptile has satisfied its entire Consciousness in this third question is that food
[56:25] food is it different a is it a threat b c is it food so the only way the reptile eats is what it shows you the only way a reptile
[56:39] eats is is there something different am I detecting something different here right and is it not a threat only then do I begin my survival
[56:52] system the reptile r has the code you've seen this code in humans around you and the reason why you see this code is because you're watching a human operating on this involuntary AI system factory reset position of the
[57:07] reptile only the first code of the reptile is all pain is evil this is before the neocortex is online pain isn't looked at in a positive way at all therefore all pain is evil why because pain costs calories
[57:22] why does pain cost calories because more action potentials come screaming into the brain and the brain has to burn more calories to process them and so the reptile would prefer a world of no brain
[57:36] calories because that's how it survives it's coldblooded it it preserves every bit of its energy and so it looks for a state that that actually sends its brain less
[57:47] information so all pain becomes evil at that point survival is 100% based on success that all that matters it that's your only success I should say sorry is
[58:01] survival can the reptiles survive doesn't matter if the reptile has a good life or a bad life why does it not matter it doesn't know it doesn't know those things so you find a simplistic attitude in the reptile mind don't you you find
[58:15] one which is will I survive through this and that would only come from this Lower State this this sympathetic state where fear becomes is more of the motivator right where survival itself is that base route that you would need to prove to
[58:30] the system that you will are willing to take over that when you demonstrate to the steering wheel of the AI inside your device that you want to survive too it decides to give you the reins and allow you to drive
[58:44] again so if you see the world to the reptile you're going to find it's got to be low calorie I have to uh feel that I Will Survive the whole time and that any pain I encounter is going
[58:57] to mean failure that I've failed whatever Choice it was that I went to this pain proves that I should not have done it and this is the antithesis of the neocortex the Neo cortex works exactly the opposite of
[59:14] this as you know it is not enough to control your reptile Society demands that you insist it's no longer there lurking in the Shadows you're accepted in
[59:28] society by proving that your reptile is dead and how do you prove that you lie you lie to people over and over to prove that your reptile is dead You Lie by uh
[59:42] expressing uh opportunities where your reptile might show itself and proving that it does not the expression holding your tongue is a is a sympathetic
[59:57] muscle it's a reptile muscle that your neocortex demanding that it can hold its reptile is the equivalent of holding your tongue I think it's safe to say James
[01:00:10] True really doesn't hold his reptile much that I I'm I'm poor at that and many of you are poor at that too and and and this is why you probably have a symbiotic connection with your reptile
[01:00:23] you probably feel sorry pray for it so you don't hold your tongue you allow it to express itself because you want it this freedom because you are looking for a piece of your own there's a certain piece that you want this
[01:00:37] congruence between the sympathetic and parasympathetic and why is it that that always looks like a shaman who comes out and starts speaking starts saying how they feel and this terrifies everyone around them but not the shaman why
[01:00:50] because it's helping the sympathetic system regulate with the parasympathetic system it's helping the person sign their name I.E become the identity of who they
[01:01:06] are the reptile is always sincere because the reptile lacks the budget for deceit deceit is a luxury of mammals when you create an identity
[01:01:24] for yourself you have a timeline and that timeline basically says my name is James I live at this street here's my phone number my social security number is this it I mean those
[01:01:37] are arbitrary but you're constantly repeating yourself to yourself you have to repeat repetition is necessary or else you lose neurons which is why you have thoughts about who you are all the time because you are trying to preserve
[01:01:51] you are bailing out a boat that is filling with with water of Amnesia every day you wake up you bail out and say I am this I am this I am this and you're removing that water to preserve that salt because that salt is the only memory you have of who you are it's all
[01:02:06] potassium tricks it's all it is so the reptile barely has enough timeline for himself so deceit would be something
[01:02:18] that would become impossible impossible deceit required that you find um enough calories to build a completely separate timeline than
[01:02:32] yourself and then deceive it so not only are for you to deceive not only do you need a timeline for yourself and a separate timeline for your deceit and for you to know the difference but you would need a timeline for the person you're
[01:02:45] deceiving which is probably the the the the most caloric thing of all this because the reptile can't even look at their own reflection so how the the [ __ ] could they even compassionate someone else it's
[01:02:58] impossible which proves to you that deceit is the creative act of the mammal it is this secret special magic power that we've developed and we only developed it through this through this time
[01:03:13] [Music] machine bird brain this concept of a bird brain comes in the same way information is expensive
[01:03:24] as a uh bird rehabber the first thing I do when I when I find a bird that's been injured is I cover its eyes why because I've compassionated the bird brain if you haven't compassionated the bird brain it might be that the
[01:03:39] first thing you do when you find a bird unconscious is give it water and food I I appreciate I know that we care but I this always cracks me up it's you're giving a someone in shock
[01:03:53] something that they could only use if they were in a parasympathetic state so when you're giving that bird the water or the food you're you're saying hey I think you're in a parasympathetic say bird which means I think you're cold calm and collected I think you're so cold calm and collected you decide
[01:04:07] there's no threats around you and you open up the possibility of feeding that this luxury of feeding comes out of you only after you've isolated and removed all threat shock problems or pain but
[01:04:21] You' just smacked yourself into a window and truly the all of the uh stress that's going to enter the bird is going to come in through its eyes and through its ears and for the bird to leave the State
[01:04:34] of Shock you would want to remove all eyesight and sound that come into that bird until it's ready for those systems to come back online so to understand the bird brain
[01:04:46] is to really understand some uh Simple Rules right information is expensive data is
[01:04:58] stress all data is stress ignorance is speed what does that mean by the bird knowing less the bird's reactions are
[01:05:12] faster there's not a system of there's not a a half second long train going by and at the very very end is the Caboose right like 15
[01:05:26] milliseconds inside the bird's brain every decision is going to be processed somewhere in there I by the way I don't I don't know what it is I just set 15 milliseconds but if you look at how our Jaws work and everything else and look at how how big a bird is I'm I'm
[01:05:40] guessing maybe it's 1550 milliseconds so that they're time time machine smaller but smaller doesn't necessarily mean weak which kind of brings me to this next point that it's kind of another sidebar but I just think it's important to realize that that
[01:05:53] birds aren't actually stupid the maau on the left has a brain the size of a walnut the monkey on the right I think it's called a maack has a brain the size of a
[01:06:07] lemon so in this case the monkey has a brain that's about five times larger than the maau but the maau actually uh passes uh more sentience tests the maau actually satisfies itself
[01:06:22] as a more intelligent creature and one of the main reasons why is because inside of its neocortex it has more neurons it's not the size of the brain it's the number of neurons that there's just surely more
[01:06:36] neurons inside that system so this concept of larger brain means smarter isn't necessarily true neurons are going to give you resolution this is a great way to think about this if you're into this is this
[01:06:51] concept of 8K versus 4K versus HTMI right and that when you're watching a video you might see or when you're watching a ball game on HDTV or or whatever versus regular TV you're like damn that's a nice picture or damn this
[01:07:05] picture sucks and that the brain would work the same way it has a certain resolution most people don't know this but you uh sadly they go out and they buy a big Monitor and they think well I bought a bigger monitor therefore it's going to it's going to give me better resolution but they buy that biger
[01:07:20] monitor from Amazon they don't realize that Amazon is sending them in 1920 1080 Monitor and just telling and just saying it's 50 in and it is but the 50 in mean that there's only 1,920 pixels between the left side and the right side right so in the same way you can see that you
[01:07:35] can have a bigger monitor but a lower resolution your brain works the same way therefore neurons are pixels neurons are pixels inside of your conscious chalkboard because you're able
[01:07:48] to build a reality out of these pixels right you're building a neurological feature set or uh I'm sorry a model you're building an entire
[01:07:59] miniature inside those neurons because those neurons are pixels voxels would be a better way to call them which are video pixels but but don't worry I won't I won't bore you with stuff like
[01:08:13] that so big isn't always better after you've looked at the Simplicity of the what we just talked about the reptile brain we start to consider the more complex systems of the hind brain this is your Epimetheus your
[01:08:32] past system that you'll notice one of the one of the big weird things that exists inside the hindbrain is social VTO that that most most things with fur
[01:08:45] incorporate some sort of social vetto with each other and that the species itself is a collective it's not a singularity it's a collective and the collective utilizes
[01:08:57] its social structure to survive how does that work one Mouse can learn a maze that Mouse can come back to the to the uh the the nest and within a few hours through some
[01:09:11] sort of weird osmosis none of us understand the other mice understand the maze they solve the maze instantly we it could be that the first thing the mouse does do us come back and say hey guys here's how you solve this
[01:09:26] maze that you're getting ready to take but that would that's you're giving a lot of assumptions that this mouse knows what's coming in the future that even has a future this is why we need to rethink Consciousness ladies and gentlemen this is this is to me this is one of the big
[01:09:40] big big big points that points to this concept of morphic resonance or species resonance that uh there's an epigenetic chemo smell chemo signature that is put off but because you and I have chosen
[01:09:53] into dull our old factory we are missing all of this vital data which is keeping us out of this lamura which I'm fine with I kind of prefer the mystery but it it it stops us from understanding this deeper nature and the
[01:10:08] only way that we can then come come back and congrate or or try and find that place I should say try and find that Zion is through social veto is through social learning is through relying on our species intelligence so that many of us can learn
[01:10:22] collectively no I've said this a million times but the first time man one ran a 4minute mile that same year like six other people did or something and they were like high school kids it's just that easy it's just that easy there's
[01:10:37] something in this Quantum I believe personally that it works with a technology belief that really what's happening is is that is that the high school kid who ran a 4-minute mile now believes that it can be done because he saw someone did it and that's truly what
[01:10:50] unlocks this ability to do it is this belief but that's uh that science is a little bit harder to prove or demonstrate to use atically right now because of the systems we have for proof one of the biggest uh biggest um
[01:11:05] things that shows you just how powerful the hindbrain is when it comes to determining the entire world and I mean warping it in kind of a sick way is um mutilation if you were to open the the
[01:11:19] DSM the diagnostic of mental illness I forget the acronym exactly but it's in its like fifth edition or whatever but you open the dsm5 and you you want to look at well what is what does mutilation really
[01:11:33] mean you end up with a definition that looks like this and I'm reading this because I want you to understand that the hindbrain is pretty pretty Psychopathic nssi is a term for this uh self- injury uh concept of self- injury
[01:11:49] just another word for clinical word for mutilation but what is the DS M5 definition of nssi according to dsm5 nssi diagnostic criteria follows over the past year the per in order for you to mutilate yourself this is the
[01:12:03] criteria okay over the past year person has to for at least five days engage in self- injury with the anticipation that the injury will result in some bodily harm no suicidal intent though the ACT
[01:12:17] is not socially acceptable this is the last sentence I want you to focus on the ACT is not acceptable guys this book tells you that the
[01:12:29] definition of Mutilation is whether or not it's socially acceptable and this is why circumcision is socially acceptable mutilation we don't Define mutilation by
[01:12:43] whether it's moral or not we Define mutilation by whether or not there's a majority opinion about it you can shove metal projectiles through your ears all day long right can
[01:12:56] wear earrings you can mutilate yourself you can cut yourself in certain situations and it's moral socially as long as you only do it for four
[01:13:09] days if you mutilate yourself for four days and 23 hours and 59 minutes and 59 seconds you didn't mutilate yourself it shows you how freaking
[01:13:21] insane the hindbrain works world is and keep in mind that we make this assumption through emotional pedophilia that everyone's online which means a lot of people that are making the rules that you and I both follow are following this
[01:13:34] idea that mutilation is defined by what other people think mutilation is shock therapy is pain medicine and it's actually true I'm not actually against shock therapy do you
[01:13:49] know why because shock therapy is vital and you could look at as a shamanic therapy the shock therapy is is a trip to the shaman Factory that one is entering into a relationship with a shaman of pain
[01:14:04] because it it provides some sort of therapy and I'm stressing this because I want you to know that medicine doesn't fix it shock fixes it pain fixes it because pain itself is the medicine for the hind brain because pain itself is
[01:14:16] rewriting the hind brain when you understand what pain is pain has to flow through the sensory into a central place the psalmist where it is asked is this the worst thing that you've ever
[01:14:30] felt if the worst thing that you've ever felt is this devastatingly guilt-ridden horrible feelings of Abandonment and isolation and just evilness then it means every time that
[01:14:44] you stub your toe every time you bump your elbow your brain has no choice but to Fire and relive the worst experience you've ever had for the sole purpose of determining whether you stubbing your
[01:14:57] toe is worse so your system itself can be overridden simply by having the governors think of these as Governors it's a like a motor term when you turn up or turn down the governor or or the
[01:15:12] idol in your car if if you ever had a car that had a carburetor I should say you could go in and twist this Governor up or down and that that Governor is actually what's dictating how much that
[01:15:24] car Idols or how little that car idols and that that at the very state that you have that's determining where that Governor rate is a state that puts you in sympathetic shock you were no longer a human
[01:15:37] being you're a person living in this endless state of oh my God oh my God oh my God because you're reg living experience that your thalma simply founds finds to be too
[01:15:51] overloading there are way ways to fix this and not only is shock therapy one of them more importantly one of the brilliant things that I've personally seen through virtual reality is the idea
[01:16:04] of reliving an experience through a virtual setting actually having a sematic effect on the sympathetic nerve system that you can experience a car accident and be put
[01:16:19] into that shock I'm telling you about where new inputs come in and and the first thing you have to do is measure well was it worse than the car accident so now you're reliving the car accident and by repeating the car accident in a voluntary state where you sit down and
[01:16:33] you V volitionally choose to reenact the car accident in a virtual setting you are now able to rewrite or restamp those memories and so that the next time that you come in to compare pain to that
[01:16:47] event you now get to compare it not to that event but to the virtual reality reenact of the event that those two blend together and regulate each other because your entire past is not
[01:17:00] somewhere outside of you it ends at the neck it ends at the extent of your limbic moth your neural Moss the seven layered pmus and when you say oh that I I I
[01:17:15] remember that deeply you're literally saying that the neurons at the very bottom of the dendritic uh ocean of this of this Moss the ones at the very very very bottom remember
[01:17:29] this reaction they remember what happened so the Oracle mythology is telling us the whole time we [ __ ] know exactly what's going on exactly how deep or how shallow our brains are
[01:17:44] exactly what it means when I say I turn my back to you as it pertains to this dorsal uh kind of life that we have alive and I swear to you when you see people you can see the rat in their face
[01:17:57] you can see the monkey in their face you can see the reptile in their face and you think it's just you just being a little bit too creative and it's not it's you using your compassion to see inside and let me take a moment to shame
[01:18:12] anyone here who thinks that reptile is a bad word because you are the person who's been helping to destroy Society by shaming this esophagus monster this esophagus tapeworm that
[01:18:26] takes us everywhere in the world so when you find someone in reptile State this is not a condescending term this is a term of oh my God this could not be an easier person to compassionate so why am
[01:18:39] I being such a tool right now by using reptilian in a derogatory way the reptile is a baby does it need to poop does it need to pee does it need
[01:18:51] its mother does it that need a nipple right it there are five things that this baby has and it's menu roster right the reptile is the same and for you to not
[01:19:06] compassionate the reptile is for you to choose to want to separate yourself and hey even that's fine with me nothing wrong with that you're in charge of how big or small your universe is aren't you
[01:19:19] so more toar to you but if you shame the reptile in my Pres I am trying to respect my reptile and I think that it would be a great opportunity for me to defend my reptile if I catch you doing that so there's
[01:19:33] your warning there's a uh a movie I showed a while ago it wasn't a movie but it was a brief clip a while ago I I tried to find it today I apologize I couldn't
[01:19:45] uh it there's a video game conference uh in which this German company is describing desing their walk cycle that they built for their character and he's describing how their human character
[01:20:00] he's carrying like a machine gun and he's just showing you on a map of all these obstacles how their character can learn how to walk keep in mind that that the operator can turn the joystick anywhere but that the character somehow
[01:20:13] has to place its feet in just the right way to match the the movement of the joystick in a certain direction and if there's like cans and and boxes and crevices and bars and and and different
[01:20:27] things the the the the programming the the game company guy who's giving this demonstration is explaining to you to to the other programmers in the audience how they were able to do that he said
[01:20:40] this was a problem you all know this is a problem none of you I've seen your game engines none of you have solved this and here we've solved this and I'm going to tell you how which is pretty cool of him to even share this

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:20:53] and he rendered the same world but around the character was a red bubble that had green splotches and these red bubble with the green splotches were places that the character could stand that would justify the existence of
[01:21:07] where he just moved and that the splotches were built from a programming interface that required the character to build a future set inside of the game at runtime and to literally live and exist
[01:21:20] in the game engine 3 seconds ahead head in the future and that it could report back to the past if you want to go uh North Northwest at 5 miles an hour through this terrain you're going to
[01:21:33] have to step on this rock to do it that it is the only way that I out of my uh in my experience that I could map you moving through this place and that's it and I'm telling you this because I I
[01:21:47] really want to sink home to you that the idea of walking is the idea of casting future and that what's profound to me about this is that a four
[01:22:00] pedal system A system that has four legs not two does not need any future prediction at all to work simply because no matter where you move there's going
[01:22:13] to be at least two more more than that most likely three legs on the ground at all times and even if if there's a box or a tree or whatever whatever the legs
[01:22:27] press down on will count as its land and that that four-legged creature needs no looking in the future to not fall for the two for the bipedal person living in a system of balance it absolutely
[01:22:41] requires that it bends and looks into the future to walk Walking is the act of time travel walking is a gift of a time
[01:22:53] machine that is living inside your head it is so profound this act and when you think about that you can imagine how much more profound running is that running really puts you into
[01:23:09] this superstate where you're becoming Prometheus we lean forward when we run because we are falling into the future that we predict will be okay it is this prediction that it will be okay which satisfies our ability ility to even go
[01:23:23] that far immediacy is a word most of you have probably heard me say but I think most of the world doesn't really understand but immediacy is the right that you've never heard of it's the Civil Right that
[01:23:40] you've never heard of and every bird every reptile every bird brain every reptile brain below you has a mediacy but you don't and it is the very fact that you're able to observe into the future
[01:23:53] that actually denies your ability to have immediacy because we all think whoa I'm afraid I'm not going to move I'm GNA think about this and we've wanted to normalize this fear of movement so bad that we've
[01:24:07] decided that the mature thing to do is to think about things and that if you're living your best life if you're really mature you're going to sleep on all these big decisions for a day and think about it and I'm not here to argue with you about that I'm here to tell you that just like
[01:24:22] that we've lost immediacy that we we forgot we forgot how immediacy trains our brain by telling our system that wow you are
[01:24:35] powerful because you have immediacy or wow you weak you have no mediacy but now our Neo cortex is just making things so [ __ ] complex because it's telling us do not eat that Taurus with sprinkles right now you will feel horrible in eight hours you will you will call
[01:24:50] yourself a fatty mcfatterson when you look in the mirror do not eat that Taurus and that now you're starting to have this conversation with your immediacy which is you cannibalizing your own reptile oh I know but you're
[01:25:05] cannibalizing your reptile you're doing that because your neocortex have has faith in your future machine so well that it thinks it's going to pull out a miracle and it does you know how I know it does because you
[01:25:18] strangled your reptile do you know how you strangled your reptile you atriped the top of your mouth right and you did it the moment you were born you're in the womb you're like I
[01:25:31] love the old factory I can smell the Universe I can smell planets from here I'm going to create constellations in my brain even though I can't see outside I can smell them from here and the moment
[01:25:44] you're born [ __ ] that man [ __ ] that this is not cool I do not like this this uh brings us back I think a little bit at least to this idea that your
[01:25:59] hindbrain is your spirit animal and so your spirit animal is really coming from a place of [ __ ] that hurt dude and so when you ask my spirit animal is guiding me what really what's happening is is all the pain that I've
[01:26:12] ever experienced has been uh animiz into this living creature and it's guiding me and so sometimes your spirit animal doesn't actually care if you have pain if if it thinks that pain might get you to this other place where it had to go
[01:26:25] to so you start to see that your intuition is not here to give you comfort this is hard for many of us to believe and this is why we don't trust our intuition we literally don't trust our intuition because our intuition
[01:26:37] causes this pain but but there's a big part of you that relies on pain to learn therefore if you really had a spirit animal it might want you to experience pain because you do not listen you do
[01:26:50] not listen to it or so it feels that way and so it inspires or encourages you to Embrace pain I think that's why sometimes it says eat the Taurus with sprinkles James I want you to feel like fatty
[01:27:05] mcfatterson tomorrow I want this experience for you because this pain will finally teach you to stop eating Tauruses like that right so the more we ignore our systems
[01:27:18] the more they have to terrorize us they start to practice forms of terrorism in exchange okay good we made it I realized that it's 8:30 I really want you to watch this
[01:27:31] video it's three minutes long if you have to go I totally understand you'll see it in the replay I really want you to watch this video I want you to see the pra economy of what's happening if you want to stay afterwards and discuss

YouTube video transcript:
[00:00] there's the parasympathetic there's the sympathetic and there is the anic and at the bottom at the base of this is this this enteric uh Kingdom it's a kingdom that that rules from the
[00:13] esophagus the stomach the intestines the pancreas the gallbladder this this system in you is basically a tapeworm that's been
[00:24] saddled by a larger organism and that larger organism is is your uh dolinic uh outer shell technically your esophagus is and
[00:38] your your stomach is its own living creature it's not even technically it it has its own neurons uh there's a lot of neurons in your stomach uh a lot and more more than
[00:51] in your heart in fact and that that this this neurological system is only recently been recognized as a brain and by recognizing it as a brain it becomes more than fair and more than
[01:04] adequate for us to recognize it as an an uh its own entity and I think the best way to understand this is is is three different kingdoms there are three kingdoms inside of you and at the base of this kingdom
[01:17] is is this cic Kingdom and if you can picture your stomach with a saddle on it and that saddle is your bone structure and all the other outer organs that are relying on that horse right they're relying on
[01:31] that Steed to uh uh carry them through the terrain safely and by that terrain technically the ground in which this horse uh carries you would be the food that you pass through your your membrane
[01:46] and as you place food inside the top of your Taurus and it and it exits out the the the bottom of your Taurus what you're really doing is giving a foot pad for this horse to
[01:57] walk and so time it's self from this if you look at what time is to this enic Kingdom time is the passage of food through its Bay that food is birthed to it from some
[02:12] unknown source outside of it and that this food is past and that that the journey requires that this anic stomach uh choose what it what it wants to learn along this journey it is not able to dictate the journey to itself it does
[02:27] not have full control over the destiny of what food will come to it its only power lies in what it chooses to digest and this should be familiar to you because it should remind you of you
[02:40] yourself that the chemical makeup that is the world the weather the system of time the system of everything that we have is its own passage of Road and that you your experiences or
[02:54] feat that have no choice but to carry yourself through this journey and so you can compassionate this enic system is both autonomous but also Bound in fact it's bound by you you were the
[03:08] ruler of this inic system you you alone are responsible for the torture or the love that that inic systems going to receive as you give it yeast as you give
[03:20] it salt as you give it sugar you are uh acting as a God you are a bow the first definition of of God came from the idea of bad
[03:33] weather and it would be wise to consider the cic kingdom as uh victims of your weather and that the weather you pass it is directly related to the protein chains or the lack of protein chains
[03:47] that you choose to distribute down the river it's River of time which is your your membrane so separating yourself from your enic
[04:01] system and seeing it as its own separate entity answers a lot of questions about addiction diet Comfort what food does to you why you have a certain passion for food but maybe that food might make you
[04:15] feel a different way and why there's a uh the the that lack of Harmony sometimes that might exist is actually uh quite natural when you understand that this is its own kingdom that this
[04:27] is its separate um um separate place and for the first time ever if if you if if you've never seen it this way for the first time ever you would begin to
[04:39] compassionate A system that you rule over that you you you would begin to extend or bestow this idea of giving witness to this creature itself and that the opening of that witness would would
[04:54] actually leave the pressure on its system to dump or refuse Sarat oent to you that it's its only voice that it has to communicate to you is this
[05:08] pleasure and the pleasure that you get from food is much more profound than you think and the pleasure that you derive from food is also chalk full of the humans that actually prepared it a homecooked meal is a home-cooked meal
[05:21] because it holds other kinds of energy and that the space between the notes of every song is no different than the space between the smells of every taste and that this space can be packed full of
[05:33] this intangible thing we call Consciousness so in that space in that intangible there is the ability to communicate with a creature that's living inside your body that you as Osiris would have this
[05:50] underling Kingdom living underneath you above that system relying on it is the sympathetic system your eyes your heart your lungs your stomach your intestines your joints and your skin the system would be nothing without
[06:05] without its horse the system is its own kingdom its own Consciousness your your heart has its own beat your breath has its own Rhythm right and that these rhythms and
[06:20] beats go on regardless of whether you're conscious or not whether you're sentient or not whether you're stupid or not that these systems have fail safe AI living
[06:32] inside them that automatically run and operate there is simple as a thermostat in your home but at the same time they have their own Matrix of emotions desires and what they want those two are
[06:47] are also imprisoned in a way inside this higher system this parasympathetic system you know what it's probably not exactly that way
[07:00] I'm sorry I'm amending this as I'm speaking really in a lot of ways the the the parasympathetic is almost a slave to the sympathetic but in a way of sort of justifying what's happening and it makes sense that I might be confused about
[07:14] this at first because we get the same confused about Washington DC that that we think Washington DC is in charge but but really the role of the politician as we just discussed recently is is not
[07:27] necessarily to change po policy or to create policy but simply to explain to the people that the policy that's already there is is not going anywhere and to give reasons and excuses to labor
[07:40] the blame of that is really an inflammatory response so if you really look at who holds the keys to your body I think you're really looking in a sympathetic place and that sympathetic place you're
[07:53] going to find out tonight is your spirit animal that spirit animal it's certainly wise I'm not asking you not to trust it but I'm also asking you to consider that your spirit animal needs
[08:07] you just as much as you you need your spirit animal and this might be something that you're not used to hearing because you feel that the spirit animal is sort of a a one-way
[08:20] Street and it's funny be we have that same false relationship with our inic system too our what we digest what we choose to eat as we talked about last time the uh
[08:33] sexual arousal is an involuntary process not necessarily controlled by your conscious mind and I I spoke briefly about how funny that seems to be when you if we believe the idea that we only
[08:47] evolved from this place because we were uh ponum fornicating ourselves into a fetish of survival that creating a Consciousness that would not allow us to turn on or off off our uh sexual
[09:01] activity would might actually make it harder for us to reproduce which gives us I think deeper Clues into not only why you're here but more importantly how you're here which is the time machines that we
[09:15] discussed last time this idea of there being a forbrain and a and a hindbrain operating and so the lessons we learned last time become even more complicated
[09:28] when we start to understand that that limic communication is a Prana economy a word we we a phrase we use a lot to talk about but to break down this pra economy you you can think of it as a chemical
[09:41] reaction a a reaction of several chemicals placed into uh the same space the same environment and that uh if you understood chemistry enough you would be able to predict I.E compassionate what those chemicals are going to do once
[09:56] they find each other once they discover that each other exist exists and once they seek out the symbiosis the symbiosis appears to have no free will when you look at chemistry you might want to say oh these chemicals
[10:10] oil and water have no free will they are bound to the idea that they are in opposition I I I would tend to agree with that I would tend to say yeah water and oil don't have free will and we
[10:23] might even argue well yeah it's because they're not alive or or we might argue that that their time machine hasn't come online yet and there is an autopilot built into all of your proteins all of your amino acids that would act just
[10:37] like chemistry and that you would automatically have a base root response a template response that allows you to exist and survive in this world that you would not be born
[10:50] still and remain still until your Consciousness formed that that would lead to you being thrown away and so you've had to develop certain system sys that were would persist regardless of whether or not you were
[11:03] online and the uh tendency for us to uh commit this phrase emotional pedophilia I talk about it really shines itself true here when we when we think and insist that everyone around us is
[11:17] online and this insistence that everyone is online is typically where we lose our compassion and our safety which loses us this topshed tier Kingdom
[11:32] called parasympathetic which is part of what what we're learning today so this pra economy before before the soul comes online and even while the soul is online there are these three basic rules and
[11:45] these three basic rules are everyone sheds everyone eats and ultimately everyone agrees that every chemical that you mix in a vile agrees and it may not look like it agree you may say oh these don't
[12:00] agree at all they're they're volatile in fact but actually no they they are in agreement it's you and I that created the idea that Civilization would always be tame kind and polite it's nature and chemistry that's been telling you the
[12:13] whole time you're not actually paying attention and so the pra economy that develops really would would have nothing to do with how Adept someone is and it really it would more have to do is how online someone
[12:27] is when you come online you end up rendering your own free will I believe but until you do there is a base free will that is built for you that comes out of the factory that just simply allows you to
[12:40] survive so this is at the heart of pra economy and and that you yourself or are subject to this pra economy and and you it's sort of a luxury in a sense because you can go below below deck tend to
[12:53] something else and and give up steering the boat but you've got autopilot on and the Rudder is constantly keeping you at your vector it would be impossible for you to
[13:06] survive without this kind of system so you in fact are a trinity and there's really nothing nothing more to argue about that that you see it working in these three
[13:20] kingdoms so everyone has a neocortex but it was Sapien sapiens that turned it into a time machine that that homo sapen said I want to turn my cortex into
[13:33] a violent tumor of growth I want it to explode and that that was such a a massive change from the standard set of of of reptile of vertebrae and that that massive change
[13:48] for whatever reason I I I think it's hard to to not um want to explain that that this was somehow manipulated on purpose because For What whatever specific reason this same Homo Sapien
[14:01] after taking a a pretty abrupt 180 degree turn in its species and actually flipping its uh flipping it its hippocampus to where the tail of its brain actually started to point forward
[14:15] much like a scorpion's tail and that for the first time we began to insist that this neocortex is more important than we think and so homo sapien takes it one more step he he he doubles down and he
[14:29] grows a growth on top of that growth and for the first time the neocortex explodes before it explodes you'll see here in this illustration just a brief a brief summary of all the other animals that have this forbrain as we talked about last time
[14:44] the forbrain you could look at as your future machine or or the or the past machine so every animal still has their seed and time but the size of the forebrain could could be said to roughly
[14:57] uh roughly point to the size of their future time machine going to contradict this just just only slightly when we talk about bird brains but it's more just to dissolve a uh a common misconception we
[15:10] have about how how dumb we think birds are um oops need to turn that off so everyone has this neocortex which means actually everyone has this sense of
[15:25] self that the neocortex really really would probably atrophy if it didn't have something to do in fact if we get to the thalmus tonight I I'll show you what happens if there is nothing to do and so the neocortex that's busy is the
[15:40] neocortex that insists it needs more space it needs more resources to produce when it comes to looking at at how far you live in time that the this is the map that I prepared to show you just how that
[15:56] works that there is a reptilian Underlord from the future not an Overlord but an actual Underlord and this un Underlord from the future is only there because you yourself are are are too far away from it that you're in
[16:11] the past but this reptilian Underlord is is on the precipice on The Cutting Edge of present and you can see this there's a
[16:23] 14 millisecond reflex from the Jaw a 30 millisecond ref flects from the blink notice that your mouth Works faster than your eyes I believe this gives you a clue over what this reptilian Underlord
[16:37] finds more important or more importantly finds more reliable or more trustable for his survival and so we I've got these listed for you sequentially because you can see his jaw is first his blink is second at
[16:51] 90 milliseconds he can move his head that even before his head he's got this jaw reflex which has to be uh 10 times faster the mouth reflex is 10 times faster than thought
[17:05] itself which is why when you this is why pigeons uh die when they eat rice at weddings the reptile brain swallows it doesn't say should I eat that it swallows it doesn't have a an
[17:20] opportunity to ask two of those luxurious questions should and even the question itself is it do I have a choice in what I do so what I'm trying to explain really delicately
[17:33] here is is that the fact that you live in the future the fact that you have this Prometheus is is literally the only reason why you even have free will that that this this weird stretchy rubber band relationship that you've
[17:47] developed with time gives you this window for a Quantum of possibilities to exists and it's very much a Quantum because you compute all of your possibilities and every single system in your body Believe It or Not takes these
[18:01] possibilities and fires them to one place called The thelus it sends them to a specific place so every single separate organism gets to put their two cents into their system and it's the
[18:14] thalmus itself that acts as this uh Bridal chamber this consecration that who will the prince Mary will determine the future of the Kingdom but every single Suitor from
[18:29] every single country will be sending their Hope Chest in their offerings into the phalus but the thalmus itself will only choose to mount with one to choose to bond with one and
[18:43] so the decision process that you see is very much the same thing you have a Quantum a million tude of decisions that you could make but all of those are converged in a Quantum inside the thalmus which means that the
[18:56] thalmus collapses reality it collapses reality what you and I call reality I should say into the present it takes all of the suggestions from the past and all of the suggestions
[19:12] from the future and conveys them into this inner chamber this sacred chamber that's literally what that word thalmus means this sacred pillow and that night something is
[19:26] consecrated something your distance from the thalmus is directly proportional to your rank inside the body if you were second in command you
[19:39] will only have one neuron jump between you and the phalus if you were third in command you will have three neurological jumps between you and the thalmus every one of these neurological jumps is an opportunity for the bureaucracy around
[19:53] you to override your vote that you send your tribute to the thalmus and you say this is so important that we swallow this this round Taurus that you see with sprinkles on top we have determined to
[20:07] be a donut and and the the delicate nature of our kingdom rest on you swallowing that dut right now the joy it will bring us as a
[20:20] people will allow us to shine forever and the thelist is like wow that's a pretty strong case you make right and there is a bishop a queen of swords that can override every decision every
[20:36] Everything the bishop says The Rook says the Knight says can be overridden by this one sacred sacred queen that has not one jump from the
[20:48] thalmus but actually vetos the thalmus we've spoken about this before and it's the nose the old factory system itself the very system that you chose in the top of your mouth to turn
[21:01] off when you were born you shut that off it's been an atropy ever since what you think is smell is actually a passive sonar that you used to have an active sonar I apologize if you don't know this
[21:14] but a submarine has the ability for active sonar which is you might have heard the symbol of ping and there's a ping sound that's sent and that that ping is is the sending of a signal that
[21:27] it active sonar will come back and they will listen to how long it took that ping to arrive versus a passive sonar which is not to send a ping but simply to listen to listen to Listen to
[21:39] listen and that paive sonar is the parabola the the peripheral vision and the macular Vision you staring directly at something would be this sense of of active sonar
[21:54] to your queen the old factory sister system it has more power than every piece combined she has all of their powers combined doesn't she with this veto what it really does is give her the
[22:09] ability to absorb the power of the bishop to go in diagonal the power of the Rook to go horizontal or vertical the power of the Knight to literally jump over pawns to achieve things
[22:21] because she holds the veto over all of them so she has all of these skills so when you start to understand who and what you are you you were a nothing more
[22:33] than a conglomerate of Symbio uh symbiosis this is a scary concept to the mind as it comes online which is why like a jet ski we have the safety mechanism built in which which keeps us
[22:47] offline until you finally approach the cockpit of this ship that you've were born inside of and slowly grew up in on your your own and you one day you wander through this Millennium Falcon and you
[23:02] turn right down this Corridor and you go down these steps and suddenly you're in this giant viewer window and you see outside and there's a steering wheel and there's a
[23:13] navigation and you suddenly control this ship and it's a scary Endeavor could be terrifying right and so so too is this concept of when and how or even if we come
[23:28] [Music] online and as I said once you come online one of the scary things is really doing the math and understanding that my mouth has 10 times the power of
[23:40] my arms that my mouth is 10 times ahead of myself of my arms and time which kind of shows you that you were screaming through time the reptile screams through time with his racing goggles on with his
[23:53] jaw first his eyes second his head third his neck neck fourth his shoulders fifth his arms his legs and at the very end trailing like a pathetic overweight cross country runner
[24:08] in eth grade not referring to anyone except for maybe someone me anyway what way at the behind way behind everyone else after the girls race is started is this little neocortex at 500
[24:22] milliseconds the very very end of the line the Caboose of the train is you that you yourself are the Caboose and it's so terrifying that you're that you're convincing yourself
[24:36] that that you control the train and that the tracks are yours and that they're laid down be until you slowly see through the veil of Hades and slowly uncover the fact that this is how it
[24:49] works that this is the system and this startle reflex in milliseconds is really showing you this reptilian Underlord Lord and more importantly where you stand on his chain of
[25:05] command the Triune brain I'm sure is a system or concept many of you hopefully maybe have heard if not um I'll just remind you but this reptilian inner brain this limic brain this uh second
[25:19] brain which is what what we were calling last time the the hindbrain or or Epimetheus and the neocortex is Prometheus so The Reptilian is the now the lyic brain is the past the neocortex
[25:32] is the future but I really want to hammer home a couple more analogies because I think it'll really help you build a neurology to understanding these different kingdoms one of which is that we are looking at the ID the ego and the
[25:47] super ego that the ID is this reptilian part of you that the ego is this lyic part of you and the super ego is this neocortex part of you and that that if you're not even 26 years old you don't even have a super
[26:01] ego and I think right now before lamura hits we live in this Dark Age time where we treat everyone as if they have a neocortex by the time they're
[26:14] 18 and it's just simply not really dealing with the same species at that point the same thing is reflected in the concept of id ego and super ego are kind of too esoteric for you or if they're just too general or
[26:29] you don't even like that framework I think you could also look at this as The Reptilian is the eye the lyic brain is the am and the neocortex is the string name uh string name meaning whatever your
[26:42] name is if if I was just talking to you I would have put your name here but whatever your name is would be that that last piece as we learned it comes online your name comes online probably a reason
[26:56] why Jewish Native American both have this tradition deep in their past of when you turn 13 you you become something your neocortex is half online right it's half the work has been done
[27:10] and you choose your name you you choose this concept of of who you are before you move forward so inside of you this red part is a joystick in a plane right it's a a jet fighter and there's this joystick
[27:25] and it's got the throttle and it's got the fire button and you could see it right there you literally wrap your fingers around this thing and wrap your thumb on top of it and that that's your motor cortex it moves your flaps it moves every flap it
[27:38] it it turns on every Thruster and it fires every bullet everyone including the sexual uh number one and number two right number one number two and number three all of those systems are are fired
[27:51] by that same core and that same core is living 480 milliseconds ahead of you that's a long time that's a long long long time to live ahead of
[28:03] you to remind you again the past this hindbrain it's looking back the Yellow Part the future this neocortex it's bent forward it's looking forward in the present this this joystick in the yid I want to take this moment though to point

<p><strong>The Three Kingdoms Within</strong></p><p>In the depths of our being, where shadows linger and secrets dance,
Three kingdoms reign, each with its own cryptic trance.
Beneath the surface, where thoughts and feelings collide,
Lies a realm untouched, where our destinies reside.</p><p>First, there's the reptilian, ancient and primal,
A silent ruler, commanding instincts vital.
With a jaw that moves swifter than thought's fleeting grace,
It governs our actions in this timeless space.</p><p>Next, the limbic domain, where emotions sway,
A labyrinth of memories, where dreams find their way.
In its depths, the echoes of our past resound,
Shaping our present, where our hearts are bound.</p><p>And then, the neocortex, the realm of endless possibilities,
Where visions of the future spark divine abilities.
Here, in the crucible of thought and reason's flame,
We shape our destinies, and carve our own name.</p><p>Three kingdoms intertwined, in the tapestry of our soul,
Each playing its part, in the grand story we unfold.
So let us heed their whispers, and honor their decree,
For within their silent halls, lies the key to set us free.</p>

<p>The Three Realms Beneath</p><p>In the fathomless depths of our innermost sanctum, where the shadows writhe and the secrets of aeons lie entwined, there exists a trinity of dominions, each veiled in eldritch mystery.</p><p>First, behold the primordial realm of the reptilian, ancient and unyielding in its sovereignty. A silent sentinel, it commands the primal urges that slumber within us all, wielding its influence with a jaw swifter than the fleeting whispers of mortal cognition.</p><p>Next, the domain of the limbic, where the echoes of bygone aeons reverberate through the labyrinthine corridors of memory. Within this cryptic expanse, emotions surge and recede like the tides of some unfathomable sea, shaping the very fabric of our existence with their inscrutable will.</p><p>And finally, the neocortex, that enigmatic citadel of reason and foresight. Here, amidst the swirling mists of potentiality, do we chart our course through the cosmic abyss, our thoughts and dreams intertwining with the ineffable mysteries of the cosmos.</p><p>Three realms intertwined, their tendrils extending into the darkest recesses of our subconscious minds, whispering secrets long forgotten and truths better left untold.

[02:27] not have full control over the destiny of what food will come to it its only power lies in what it chooses to digest and this should be familiar to you because it should remind you of you
[02:40] yourself that the chemical makeup that is the world the weather the system of time the system of everything that we have is its own passage of Road and that you your experiences or
[02:54] feat that have no choice but to carry yourself through this journey and so you can compassionate this enic system is both autonomous but also Bound in fact it's bound by you you were the
[03:08] ruler of this inic system you you alone are responsible for the torture or the love that that inic systems going to receive as you give it yeast as you give
[03:20] it salt as you give it sugar you are uh acting as a God you are a bow the first definition of of God came from the idea of bad
[03:33] weather and it would be wise to consider the cic kingdom as uh victims of your weather and that the weather you pass it is directly related to the protein chains or the lack of protein chains
[03:47] that you choose to distribute down the river it's River of time which is your your membrane so separating yourself from your enic
[04:01] system and seeing it as its own separate entity answers a lot of questions about addiction diet Comfort what food does to you why you have a certain passion for food but maybe that food might make you
[04:15] feel a different way and why there's a uh the the that lack of Harmony sometimes that might exist is actually uh quite natural when you understand that this is its own kingdom that this
[04:27] is its separate um um separate place and for the first time ever if if you if if you've never seen it this way for the first time ever you would begin to
[04:39] compassionate A system that you rule over that you you you would begin to extend or bestow this idea of giving witness to this creature itself and that the opening of that witness would would
[04:54] actually leave the pressure on its system to dump or refuse Sarat oent to you that it's its only voice that it has to communicate to you is this
[05:08] pleasure and the pleasure that you get from food is much more profound than you think and the pleasure that you derive from food is also chalk full of the humans that actually prepared it a homecooked meal is a home-cooked meal
[05:21] because it holds other kinds of energy and that the space between the notes of every song is no different than the space between the smells of every taste and that this space can be packed full of
[05:33] this intangible thing we call Consciousness so in that space in that intangible there is the ability to communicate with a creature that's living inside your body that you as Osiris would have this
[05:50] underling Kingdom living underneath you above that system relying on it is the sympathetic system your eyes your heart your lungs your stomach your intestines your joints and your skin the system would be nothing without
[06:05] without its horse the system is its own kingdom its own Consciousness your your heart has its own beat your breath has its own Rhythm right and that these rhythms and
[06:20] beats go on regardless of whether you're conscious or not whether you're sentient or not whether you're stupid or not that these systems have fail safe AI living
[06:32] inside them that automatically run and operate there is simple as a thermostat in your home but at the same time they have their own Matrix of emotions desires and what they want those two are
[06:47] are also imprisoned in a way inside this higher system this parasympathetic system you know what it's probably not exactly that way
[07:00] I'm sorry I'm amending this as I'm speaking really in a lot of ways the the the parasympathetic is almost a slave to the sympathetic but in a way of sort of justifying what's happening and it makes sense that I might be confused about
[07:14] this at first because we get the same confused about Washington DC that that we think Washington DC is in charge but but really the role of the politician as we just discussed recently is is not
[07:27] necessarily to change po policy or to create policy but simply to explain to the people that the policy that's already there is is not going anywhere and to give reasons and excuses to labor
[07:40] the blame of that is really an inflammatory response so if you really look at who holds the keys to your body I think you're really looking in a sympathetic place and that sympathetic place you're
[07:53] going to find out tonight is your spirit animal that spirit animal it's certainly wise I'm not asking you not to trust it but I'm also asking you to consider that your spirit animal needs
[08:07] you just as much as you you need your spirit animal and this might be something that you're not used to hearing because you feel that the spirit animal is sort of a a one-way
[08:20] Street and it's funny be we have that same false relationship with our inic system too our what we digest what we choose to eat as we talked about last time the uh
[08:33] sexual arousal is an involuntary process not necessarily controlled by your conscious mind and I I spoke briefly about how funny that seems to be when you if we believe the idea that we only
[08:47] evolved from this place because we were uh ponum fornicating ourselves into a fetish of survival that creating a Consciousness that would not allow us to turn on or off off our uh sexual
[09:01] activity would might actually make it harder for us to reproduce which gives us I think deeper Clues into not only why you're here but more importantly how you're here which is the time machines that we
[09:15] discussed last time this idea of there being a forbrain and a and a hindbrain operating and so the lessons we learned last time become even more complicated
[09:28] when we start to understand that that limic communication is a Prana economy a word we we a phrase we use a lot to talk about but to break down this pra economy you you can think of it as a chemical
[09:41] reaction a a reaction of several chemicals placed into uh the same space the same environment and that uh if you understood chemistry enough you would be able to predict I.E compassionate what those chemicals are going to do once
[09:56] they find each other once they discover that each other exist exists and once they seek out the symbiosis the symbiosis appears to have no free will when you look at chemistry you might want to say oh these chemicals
[10:10] oil and water have no free will they are bound to the idea that they are in opposition I I I would tend to agree with that I would tend to say yeah water and oil don't have free will and we
[10:23] might even argue well yeah it's because they're not alive or or we might argue that that their time machine hasn't come online yet and there is an autopilot built into all of your proteins all of your amino acids that would act just
[10:37] like chemistry and that you would automatically have a base root response a template response that allows you to exist and survive in this world that you would not be born
[10:50] still and remain still until your Consciousness formed that that would lead to you being thrown away and so you've had to develop certain system sys that were would persist regardless of whether or not you were
[11:03] online and the uh tendency for us to uh commit this phrase emotional pedophilia I talk about it really shines itself true here when we when we think and insist that everyone around us is
[11:17] online and this insistence that everyone is online is typically where we lose our compassion and our safety which loses us this topshed tier Kingdom
[11:32] called parasympathetic which is part of what what we're learning today so this pra economy before before the soul comes online and even while the soul is online there are these three basic rules and
[11:45] these three basic rules are everyone sheds everyone eats and ultimately everyone agrees that every chemical that you mix in a vile agrees and it may not look like it agree you may say oh these don't
[12:00] agree at all they're they're volatile in fact but actually no they they are in agreement it's you and I that created the idea that Civilization would always be tame kind and polite it's nature and chemistry that's been telling you the
[12:13] whole time you're not actually paying attention and so the pra economy that develops really would would have nothing to do with how Adept someone is and it really it would more have to do is how online someone
[12:27] is when you come online you end up rendering your own free will I believe but until you do there is a base free will that is built for you that comes out of the factory that just simply allows you to
[12:40] survive so this is at the heart of pra economy and and that you yourself or are subject to this pra economy and and you it's sort of a luxury in a sense because you can go below below deck tend to
[12:53] something else and and give up steering the boat but you've got autopilot on and the Rudder is constantly keeping you at your vector it would be impossible for you to
[13:06] survive without this kind of system so you in fact are a trinity and there's really nothing nothing more to argue about that that you see it working in these three
[13:20] kingdoms so everyone has a neocortex but it was Sapien sapiens that turned it into a time machine that that homo sapen said I want to turn my cortex into
[13:33] a violent tumor of growth I want it to explode and that that was such a a massive change from the standard set of of of reptile of vertebrae and that that massive change
[13:48] for whatever reason I I I think it's hard to to not um want to explain that that this was somehow manipulated on purpose because For What whatever specific reason this same Homo Sapien
[14:01] after taking a a pretty abrupt 180 degree turn in its species and actually flipping its uh flipping it its hippocampus to where the tail of its brain actually started to point forward
[14:15] much like a scorpion's tail and that for the first time we began to insist that this neocortex is more important than we think and so homo sapien takes it one more step he he he doubles down and he
[14:29] grows a growth on top of that growth and for the first time the neocortex explodes before it explodes you'll see here in this illustration just a brief a brief summary of all the other animals that have this forbrain as we talked about last time
[14:44] the forbrain you could look at as your future machine or or the or the past machine so every animal still has their seed and time but the size of the forebrain could could be said to roughly
[14:57] uh roughly point to the size of their future time machine going to contradict this just just only slightly when we talk about bird brains but it's more just to dissolve a uh a common misconception we
[15:10] have about how how dumb we think birds are um oops need to turn that off so everyone has this neocortex which means actually everyone has this sense of
[15:25] self that the neocortex really really would probably atrophy if it didn't have something to do in fact if we get to the thalmus tonight I I'll show you what happens if there is nothing to do and so the neocortex that's busy is the
[15:40] neocortex that insists it needs more space it needs more resources to produce when it comes to looking at at how far you live in time that the this is the map that I prepared to show you just how that
[15:56] works that there is a reptilian Underlord from the future not an Overlord but an actual Underlord and this un Underlord from the future is only there because you yourself are are are too far away from it that you're in
[16:11] the past but this reptilian Underlord is is on the precipice on The Cutting Edge of present and you can see this there's a
[16:23] 14 millisecond reflex from the Jaw a 30 millisecond ref flects from the blink notice that your mouth Works faster than your eyes I believe this gives you a clue over what this reptilian Underlord
[16:37] finds more important or more importantly finds more reliable or more trustable for his survival and so we I've got these listed for you sequentially because you can see his jaw is first his blink is second at
[16:51] 90 milliseconds he can move his head that even before his head he's got this jaw reflex which has to be uh 10 times faster the mouth reflex is 10 times faster than thought
[17:05] itself which is why when you this is why pigeons uh die when they eat rice at weddings the reptile brain swallows it doesn't say should I eat that it swallows it doesn't have a an
[17:20] opportunity to ask two of those luxurious questions should and even the question itself is it do I have a choice in what I do so what I'm trying to explain really delicately
[17:33] here is is that the fact that you live in the future the fact that you have this Prometheus is is literally the only reason why you even have free will that that this this weird stretchy rubber band relationship that you've
[17:47] developed with time gives you this window for a Quantum of possibilities to exists and it's very much a Quantum because you compute all of your possibilities and every single system in your body Believe It or Not takes these
[18:01] possibilities and fires them to one place called The thelus it sends them to a specific place so every single separate organism gets to put their two cents into their system and it's the
[18:14] thalmus itself that acts as this uh Bridal chamber this consecration that who will the prince Mary will determine the future of the Kingdom but every single Suitor from
[18:29] every single country will be sending their Hope Chest in their offerings into the phalus but the thalmus itself will only choose to mount with one to choose to bond with one and
[18:43] so the decision process that you see is very much the same thing you have a Quantum a million tude of decisions that you could make but all of those are converged in a Quantum inside the thalmus which means that the
[18:56] thalmus collapses reality it collapses reality what you and I call reality I should say into the present it takes all of the suggestions from the past and all of the suggestions
[19:12] from the future and conveys them into this inner chamber this sacred chamber that's literally what that word thalmus means this sacred pillow and that night something is
[19:26] consecrated something your distance from the thalmus is directly proportional to your rank inside the body if you were second in command you
[19:39] will only have one neuron jump between you and the phalus if you were third in command you will have three neurological jumps between you and the thalmus every one of these neurological jumps is an opportunity for the bureaucracy around
[19:53] you to override your vote that you send your tribute to the thalmus and you say this is so important that we swallow this this round Taurus that you see with sprinkles on top we have determined to
[20:07] be a donut and and the the delicate nature of our kingdom rest on you swallowing that dut right now the joy it will bring us as a
[20:20] people will allow us to shine forever and the thelist is like wow that's a pretty strong case you make right and there is a bishop a queen of swords that can override every decision every
[20:36] Everything the bishop says The Rook says the Knight says can be overridden by this one sacred sacred queen that has not one jump from the
[20:48] thalmus but actually vetos the thalmus we've spoken about this before and it's the nose the old factory system itself the very system that you chose in the top of your mouth to turn
[21:01] off when you were born you shut that off it's been an atropy ever since what you think is smell is actually a passive sonar that you used to have an active sonar I apologize if you don't know this
[21:14] but a submarine has the ability for active sonar which is you might have heard the symbol of ping and there's a ping sound that's sent and that that ping is is the sending of a signal that
[21:27] it active sonar will come back and they will listen to how long it took that ping to arrive versus a passive sonar which is not to send a ping but simply to listen to listen to Listen to
[21:39] listen and that paive sonar is the parabola the the peripheral vision and the macular Vision you staring directly at something would be this sense of of active sonar
[21:54] to your queen the old factory sister system it has more power than every piece combined she has all of their powers combined doesn't she with this veto what it really does is give her the
[22:09] ability to absorb the power of the bishop to go in diagonal the power of the Rook to go horizontal or vertical the power of the Knight to literally jump over pawns to achieve things
[22:21] because she holds the veto over all of them so she has all of these skills so when you start to understand who and what you are you you were a nothing more
[22:33] than a conglomerate of Symbio uh symbiosis this is a scary concept to the mind as it comes online which is why like a jet ski we have the safety mechanism built in which which keeps us
[22:47] offline until you finally approach the cockpit of this ship that you've were born inside of and slowly grew up in on your your own and you one day you wander through this Millennium Falcon and you
[23:02] turn right down this Corridor and you go down these steps and suddenly you're in this giant viewer window and you see outside and there's a steering wheel and there's a
[23:13] navigation and you suddenly control this ship and it's a scary Endeavor could be terrifying right and so so too is this concept of when and how or even if we come
[23:28] [Music] online and as I said once you come online one of the scary things is really doing the math and understanding that my mouth has 10 times the power of
[23:40] my arms that my mouth is 10 times ahead of myself of my arms and time which kind of shows you that you were screaming through time the reptile screams through time with his racing goggles on with his
[23:53] jaw first his eyes second his head third his neck neck fourth his shoulders fifth his arms his legs and at the very end trailing like a pathetic overweight cross country runner
[24:08] in eth grade not referring to anyone except for maybe someone me anyway what way at the behind way behind everyone else after the girls race is started is this little neocortex at 500
[24:22] milliseconds the very very end of the line the Caboose of the train is you that you yourself are the Caboose and it's so terrifying that you're that you're convincing yourself
[24:36] that that you control the train and that the tracks are yours and that they're laid down be until you slowly see through the veil of Hades and slowly uncover the fact that this is how it
[24:49] works that this is the system and this startle reflex in milliseconds is really showing you this reptilian Underlord Lord and more importantly where you stand on his chain of
[25:05] command the Triune brain I'm sure is a system or concept many of you hopefully maybe have heard if not um I'll just remind you but this reptilian inner brain this limic brain this uh second
[25:19] brain which is what what we were calling last time the the hindbrain or or Epimetheus and the neocortex is Prometheus so The Reptilian is the now the lyic brain is the past the neocortex
[25:32] is the future but I really want to hammer home a couple more analogies because I think it'll really help you build a neurology to understanding these different kingdoms one of which is that we are looking at the ID the ego and the
[25:47] super ego that the ID is this reptilian part of you that the ego is this lyic part of you and the super ego is this neocortex part of you and that that if you're not even 26 years old you don't even have a super
[26:01] ego and I think right now before lamura hits we live in this Dark Age time where we treat everyone as if they have a neocortex by the time they're
[26:14] 18 and it's just simply not really dealing with the same species at that point the same thing is reflected in the concept of id ego and super ego are kind of too esoteric for you or if they're just too general or
[26:29] you don't even like that framework I think you could also look at this as The Reptilian is the eye the lyic brain is the am and the neocortex is the string name uh string name meaning whatever your
[26:42] name is if if I was just talking to you I would have put your name here but whatever your name is would be that that last piece as we learned it comes online your name comes online probably a reason
[26:56] why Jewish Native American both have this tradition deep in their past of when you turn 13 you you become something your neocortex is half online right it's half the work has been done
[27:10] and you choose your name you you choose this concept of of who you are before you move forward so inside of you this red part is a joystick in a plane right it's a a jet fighter and there's this joystick
[27:25] and it's got the throttle and it's got the fire button and you could see it right there you literally wrap your fingers around this thing and wrap your thumb on top of it and that that's your motor cortex it moves your flaps it moves every flap it

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
27:38] it it turns on every Thruster and it fires every bullet everyone including the sexual uh number one and number two right number one number two and number three all of those systems are are fired
[27:51] by that same core and that same core is living 480 milliseconds ahead of you that's a long time that's a long long long time to live ahead of
[28:03] you to remind you again the past this hindbrain it's looking back the Yellow Part the future this neocortex it's bent forward it's looking forward in the present this this joystick in the yid I want to take this moment though to point
[28:18] out that that everything about you and your essence is actually built into this hindbrain and forebrain and those those things both happen to stop at the neck which means that the future and the
[28:31] past are only in your head that you you you tricky tricky bastard that that you've been painting the future and the past so well in your head this whole time that you you may
[28:44] not actually realize that they do not exist outside of you and the answer is hey guess what they they do not exist outside of you you made them you made these things appear this is your quantum you were your own
[28:58] Quantum Galaxy right and you're able to convolve the universe you see and to collapse your wave of possibility into what you believe will happen ultimately what your will is but we're still learning to navigate
[29:12] our will much like a fighter pilot learns to uh handle the G forces of his own his own stick and until he's ready until he knows he won't faint Under Pressure there's only going to be so
[29:24] fast he's going to go inside this ship to Zink this home even further if you've ever paid attention at all when you turn on a computer that the first thing that happens when you turn on a computer is your bios boots
[29:38] up your bios and it looks like this black screen on the bottom right doesn't necessarily say American Meat Trends but that's a pretty popular one but sometimes you'll see energy star or Dell or something else but it's it's the bio
[29:52] booting up and if you read that you you could click on Tab and you could enter into the operating system of your reptilian core and you could change your time clock you could change uh the settings on your RAM chips you could you
[30:05] could assign new primary hard drives and and literally tell it where your body is and there's these low-level processes and it's kind of tricky and scary and most people don't like to even go into their bios because talking to the reptile is serious business it's not a fun activity it's not a friendly
[30:19] interface in fact why because it doesn't have the luxury of this past and present it has to be spoken to and very direct ways where you can only enter numbers like one through four you know different choices like that it's very
[30:33] simplistic above the BIOS though right after that bios window boots up you notice something fancier comes on your operating system comes on and if you're on Mac or if you're on Windows or if you're looking at your cell phone you're watching that operating system come on
[30:48] and that that operating system is really your hindbrain I say that because most operating systems or every operating system that's going to survive has built into it a dummy proof system that tries
[31:02] to make it harder for the driver to destroy it that through password memory through hey are you sure you want to throw this away to hey man are you sure you want to empty your trash can to hey your firewall's not on or are you sure you want to see this site or you sure you
[31:16] want to download this program that from the very system that the hindbrain comes on comes a system of doubt that the past brings you the ability to doubt the now to doubt the future to doubt what might happen to
[31:30] someone and that that doubt comes from this very idea of learning to test pain and that pain teaches us doubt and doubt teaches us resilience to change it doesn't teach us anything else but just
[31:44] to try something so with the very heart of every motivation you have comes this gift that came to you which is doubt doubt in doubt in the present doubt in in your your insistence that if you do nothing everything will will be okay and
[31:58] so all systems come online from there this is your operating system and as you're using your operating system you notice that inside your operating system there are several programs you can run several of them and you can open up calculator you can open
[32:13] up your browser and literally go anywhere you can open up Photoshop paint some pictures and all these applications are simply identities and that you yourself the identity that you think you are your name your string name is the application
[32:28] or the game that you were running inside the operating system which is resting on top of the BIOS which booted the computer and literally tells the machine inside where everything goes this is your motor
[32:42] cortex the thalmus is the only one that has the key to communicate with the motor cortex where the motor cortex can trust it and so all these decisions are collapsed through your operating system
[32:54] into your bios and you hear this magnetic needle right or erase right and erase right and erase a piece of silicon inside your body inside your hard
[33:10] drive the I and the am would be the noun and the verb wouldn't it and that the I the noun the sense of I develops a sense of am as we talked about only by having a sense of memory and only through
[33:24] memory do we develop the past which basically proves that the am exists inside the lyic self the limic self is the amness of you The Reptilian self is the eyess of
[33:38] you the eyess is pure reflex the amness is pure oh [ __ ] did that hurt or did that not hurt and above this is your name you can see different systems how they each run I won't read them all here but the
[33:53] reptilian complex run in the basil ganglia the basil basically just a a a simple word for an area of the brain this Gangi is technically a misnomer um
[34:05] it's should be actually called a nuclei but it was named before our anatomy got straight but basically just a collection a collection in a space so The Reptilian is a collection of reflexes that are centralized into a
[34:20] space that you and I start to call a system and that you and I would only know that it's a system because we have a past and a future right that without the past and future we wouldn't even know it's a system which is why I'm trying to tell you and convey that the eye doesn't know it's a system the eye
[34:35] does not know its separation from the world you show a reptile its reflection in the mirror and with the exception of the few idios syncratic cases or or uh
[34:48] sorry that's the wrong word but but there's a few people that that love their lizard so much that they insist that this doesn't happen but but most animals will attack their own reflection if kind of terrifying terrifying because they don't
[35:00] have an the I has no am to relate to it has no idea to even learn about itself cannot learn about yourself and until you have this memory to build this idea of test response test response test
[35:14] response every every reaction you have to what you think is consciousness really boils down to you testing whether something is conscious or not how do you test something you secretly manipulate it into making it self adjust to
[35:29] something that makes it more comfortable what if I was to tell you that every conversation you have is that you pushing someone into a state of of discomfort and that the reason why you're pushing someone into a state of discomfort is because you want to know
[35:44] if they are alive so what do you say you say hello there how is well James how is Hello there a state of discomfort because all of us are socially connected through through our inner ear and through the
[35:59] inner ear you've been trained in a process where if you hear something you answer and you you physically feel itchy if you don't you feel discomfort if you don't so when someone says hello there they're actually putting you on the spot
[36:12] they're actually saying prove to me that you exist prove to me that you are alive it's a challenge question is what it is and so you answer back you answer back proving that you exist why why do you prove that because
[36:26] just demonstrated that you have the ability to accept something from them and respond to it which really means you're just showing that you are reactive that your your reactions are
[36:40] online right and this this defines the relationship that they have with you from the moment you prove that by saying hello there right now the system recalls itself because you've set up a protocol
[36:54] you just like a web browser when I go to HTT tpsg google.com I tell Google hello I'd like to establish a tcpi connection with you through a secure socket layer do you agree hello there is hello I'd
[37:07] like to establish an asynchronous connection between the two of us using the protocol of English do you agree and his answer hello is that agreement both of those Agreements are
[37:20] YouTu now forging a reality a wormhole between universe and universe and that worm only exists because of this relationship this
[37:34] Trinity this Trinity that exists so you develop things like jealousy one of the most beautiful emotions you want to know why jealousy exists in the world because there are people that do not know that they they
[37:49] exist and jealousy reminds them wait a minute a person that deserves more and this jealousy I feel is the inspiration that I have that I deserve this thing that that I do not that I do not have
[38:01] right now it's the most beautiful motivation jealousy is it shows you that you have lack and the only reason why you have lack is because you found a shell that was big enough to fill your
[38:15] potential and that your potential has to get off its ass right that's what jealousy is so all of these all of these uh emotions we have are the
[38:28] limic systems growing exercising themselves right proving that they have relevance in this world which is really the essence of am I am I am I am I
[38:41] relevate I relevate I relevate right I am relevant to myself to others around me I am I am so this Trinity gives you three different
[38:54] kingdoms to trade with you trade with these kingdoms don't you you're who you think you truly are is really an a uh a like a some sort of Diplomat and you're opening trade routes
[39:09] into each of these kingdoms that are autonomous that their economies don't necessarily need you that you have to do what they have to do you have to prove your relevance to them by saying I'm online now and the first thing The Reptilian says is no you're not dude you're going to go to bed or you're
[39:23] drinking a beer or you're not you you don't know that pure dangers of of you know of hypothermia you're not even wearing a jacket and that slowly you build Authority you build confidence inside these kingdoms by showing up for
[39:37] them by relying on them by recognizing them by analizing them and by freaking talking to them by talking to your stomach by talking to your lyic self by acknowledging your jealousy as a
[39:52] as a beautiful sign of a Hermit grab who's just found a bigger place to live all of these reactions are giving you opportunities to respond to yourself and every time you respond to yourself you're given more Privileges and one day you'll notice the
[40:06] reptilian Overlord has given you the keys itself to the very cockpit that drives your body and that's that's a special relationship and what happens then the selft Talk
[40:19] Stops you become a different kind of antenna and your life uh your life changes just from there you might call this a sidebar but I really I really want to hit this home I I briefly mentioned this last time
[40:36] this idea of of these postures de decorticate and de de decerebrate I've been singing decerebrate Good Times decorate to try
[40:48] and remember but it's like decorate oh decorticate yeah I want you to look at these postures that the the if you could fire every reflex in the body right if you could pinch all the nerves that you
[41:02] know send in a reflex I think that by pinching those nerves what you're really doing is you're demanding now that that you're shutting off the territorial authority
[41:16] of the hindbrain and the forebrain and by shutting off those territories your identity is reduced to your inner brain to this Reptilian Brain and so the The Reflex action of
[41:31] the body when it's in a state of of this this decortication if that's a word or or decerebration I I hope that you can see from these pictures that I've shown is really just expressing the the true
[41:45] nature of who it is that this posture is the self living inside this inner brain living inside this edness the bios the body takes the shape of the BIOS
[41:59] because the body is the BIOS right all the reflexes have been triggered and so you become the actual shape of your Consciousness right and that that's what this is this is a cross-section of your of your spinal
[42:19] [Music] column and when you deal with the world you're going to have negative emotions that come in and you're going to have positive emotions that that come in and you're going to send out negative emotions and you're going to send out
[42:31] positive emotions and what those really mean I think could be reduced to the words dorsal and ventral and that this idea I turn my back on you is the Oracle of Mythology explaining to you that it knows exactly
[42:47] how the body works that when you were in a parasympathetic State you open your lines of communication to ventral communication and vental communication would give you
[42:58] this ability to share and by sharing you are now reading the faces of others in the room and by reading the faces of others in the room you are becoming susceptible to all of their emotions because you tap into their face and you
[43:12] create this HTTP connection just as you do as Google and you actually don't get to dictate what Google's going to send you and they could play you some of the most obscene information or propaganda you could see and there's really no way
[43:25] that you could unsee that because of the nature of how we work and because of that your body has to have these really strong mechanisms that are built in where if if the body receives enough of
[43:40] a negative signal that causes it enough stress the body will switch into dorsal mode and dedicate all of its resources to its back so when something turns its back on you it's actually saying I'm
[43:54] only going to watch you like a hawk now I'm only going to become dorsal really really means I'm only going to become a a furent or
[44:05] sensory right I'm only going to become receptive much like a a a uh when a predator finds a rabbit the rabbit becomes receptive and simply watches the
[44:19] Predator from a dorsal place the rabbit will not communicate because its vental system the front of its spinal column says no no we do not engage in the luxury of communication because this is
[44:33] a dangerous situation our dorsal has taken over it needs all of these things which is why our motor our eer systems that run down our spine because they come down our ventral Pathways we can sometimes faint we lose the ability to
[44:48] even move the reason why we cannot move is because our dorsal system is overloaded and is running things this is a safety mechanism it's a safety response it's actually you your body doing a good job
[45:03] which is why it's so important for you to come online because when you're online you're going to be able to give your vental system the confidence it needs when when it's needed same for your dorsal too
[45:16] so the intrinsic nature of reality itself as being a negative or a positive emotion is literally expressed inside the center of your of your spinal column if I don't understand you I can
[45:30] no longer parasympathetically regulate with you we like to think that when we say I don't understand you it's because our mind doesn't follow what the other person is
[45:46] saying I don't think that ever happens I think that when someone says something you try and keep Pace with them and you put the play the pace in your system and you hit play and you
[46:01] find it to be maybe similar to how a mother might might view punk punk rock music or something or something that that that disturbs the system that your immune response is to
[46:15] not understand it it's an immune response but because you live in the Caboose you create this idea that you don't understand what you really what you really mean is
[46:29] that you cannot regulate to it I cannot regulate to the system is what's really happening your signature this is this is pretty cool so when you when you when you uh sign your
[46:47] name it turns out that that that you have to enter into a delicate slow dance where your parasympathetic and your sympathetic atic have to work in tandem that the and this is beautiful because
[47:00] from a very uh early age in our history we started to associate someone being responsible for when someone signs their name why because when you sign your name you demonstrate an ability to have a delicate dance a Harmony between your
[47:15] parasympathetic and sympathetic and you can understand why because a signature is certainly a motor your your motor response gives it gives you the orders how to conduct itself to sign your name mine would be
[47:30] uh uh 80 80° uh up bubble hard stop um -10 degrees down straight down going backwards to send past the a cender
[47:43] baseline another uh another 80 units and I just I just drew a j and that that motor cortex that fires that signature um our motor cortex could simply it knows the shape but if the
[47:57] motor cortex tries to sign its name it loses the calligraphy and more importantly the relaxation that makes the signature real the
[48:07] x is The Reptilian telling I am in charge x marks the spot is The Reptilian signing the name because the delicate balance between the the cerebellum and the basil ganglia hasn't been learned
[48:23] yet when one learns to sign their name they learn to create an integration between these two places otherwise it doesn't even look like the signature keep in mind the signature isn't necessarily shape a
[48:38] signature is calligraphy what does that mean a signature is a Time ballet it's a movement of the hand through time so how fast and how slow you get there is actually even more important than the direction of the
[48:54] shape we've spoken a lot about calories before but if you really want to start to truly understand the low calorie brain the the best way to start is with a bear
[49:09] that size is equal to threat shrink makes you feel comfortable when something shrinks in your eyes you feel comfortable when something grows in
[49:22] your eyes you feel Danger The Only Exception to this is when you outweigh your opponent in the manliness The Art of Manliness which is hilarious that that this meme was put out by The Art of
[49:37] Manliness it shows you that when you encounter a Grizzly you don't run you lay on the ground and you play dead you roll over in a fetal position and you show at your ass but if you counter a black bear it's
[49:51] much different right you shake you yell you scream you you act larger so this meme is telling you to do two different things based on which kind of bear you see then it starts to educate
[50:05] you later in the article about how to even explain to identify which bear is which so why would you have two different reactions to the same animal and it comes back down again to this
[50:16] idea of size why does it come down to size because size equals threat that's why and not only does say size equals threat but when when the threat shrinks you feel comfort and when the the threat
[50:29] grows you feel danger which is why every animal that you know has the ability to hot itself to blow itself up to to to raise its hunches or its cackles or its feathers or its fur and to appear larger
[50:44] because that would be the response to what to regulate its opponent's nervous system why does it regulate it because the opponent feels um
[50:58] advantage and that the threat itself feels that advantage and wants to regulate to it to disallow the advantage and so therefore grows itself in size to compensate which is what that's a symbiotic relationship isn't
[51:11] it that really what's happening is is that your nervous system is responding to the Bear's nervous system just as any other animal will respond to and you develop strategies for for which response is better and these Strate
[51:25] IES are profoundly creative you have to know your opponent you have to know what it is you're you're facing right and a good way to do that is to understand the brain that you're dealing
[51:39] with a rat brain is tuned to the nose it's smell Birds emotions are tuned to their ears believe it or not that what they hear dictates most of their lyic activity in their brain fish entirely
[51:54] different the lyic nature of fish really is more uh responds more to electricity than anything else electricity in the water
[52:06] creates its limic Dimension its limic self to know thyself may not necessarily be to know thy enemy that thy enemy would simply be based on what who has size size is more
[52:20] of a metaphor here but that which is larger would would constitute what something could be we would consider our enemy if we uh outflank our enemy they it's hard for them to become our enemy
[52:32] if they if they do not pose threat this threat is the reptile Loop that there is a giant species of world that require threat to survive that that threat itself reminds the lizard that it's
[52:46] alive and so the reptile Loop is simple and that you will find this inside human beings you will find them running the reptile Loop sometimes and when you recognize this you have the ability to compassionate them very deeply because
[52:59] of how simplistic their Loop is it really becomes very simple and when someone's not online you're going to find the same simplistic Loop running in a lot of people's cases I don't think it runs all the time I think each of us
[53:13] slip in and out of autonomy if that makes sense that some of us may come online for seven minutes every day some of us may come online for seven minutes every year and that our percentage of that
[53:26] truly is based on on our Zen ability in this Dojo right to uh not necessarily grab the reins although certainly that's important but to not let go of them this reptile Loop though is much simpler
[53:40] process number one what is different that the loop is is the iteration that runs every update every time the processor can it comes back and it asks the program the reptile program what do you want I got some time for you what do you want the first thing the reptile
[53:54] says is is what's different and the thalmus has received all of this information and thanks to memory thanks to thought that knows which things are different and so the neurons that are different are able to Fire and that's routed to the reptile
[54:08] and the reptile is able to determine out of the 60 trillion inputs that that we just read which of these 60 trillion inputs are different and now it focuses only on those different things which means you just discovered the largest
[54:21] blind spot that's ever existed inside the reptile mind which is what is different that you find a camouflage in the sameness when dealing with the reptile that you become invisible you've heard of this concept before in Men In
[54:36] Black that these figures that wear this black become invisible to a certain kind of Consciousness and it it it's just discussing the anatomy of the brain that's not even sci-fi we're just telling you how the brain Loops the

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
54:50] reptile will not see you if you do not move number two is this thing that's different remember this is only with what's different is the things that were different the last Loop out of all those things that's different which of them is a threat to
[55:06] me it runs this Loop it tries to determine if it's a threat most most reptiles really aren't able to determine threat or not all they can really determine is what was my system last
[55:20] Loop and what was my system this Loop which one feels better to me better is a very simplistic definition to the reptile though because better isn't built on a future or past machine it's more built on a what was my last reflex machine this comes back to number one
[55:35] what is different the reptile doesn't have a long brain which means the very next signal is going to overwrite the signal that was stored before it this gives the reptile a kind of
[55:47] blindness an ignorant blindness which also makes it Brave which also makes it dangerous this is the essence of white belt the true power of the white belt comes in this ignorance this blind
[56:00] ignorance that gives you the courage to exist after is it threat only then does after it passes these two luxuries does the reptile ask the final most important
[56:14] question and I I stress this it's the final question because the brain is done at this point the reptile has satisfied its entire Consciousness in this third question is that food
[56:25] food is it different a is it a threat b c is it food so the only way the reptile eats is what it shows you the only way a reptile
[56:39] eats is is there something different am I detecting something different here right and is it not a threat only then do I begin my survival
[56:52] system the reptile r has the code you've seen this code in humans around you and the reason why you see this code is because you're watching a human operating on this involuntary AI system factory reset position of the
[57:07] reptile only the first code of the reptile is all pain is evil this is before the neocortex is online pain isn't looked at in a positive way at all therefore all pain is evil why because pain costs calories
[57:22] why does pain cost calories because more action potentials come screaming into the brain and the brain has to burn more calories to process them and so the reptile would prefer a world of no brain
[57:36] calories because that's how it survives it's coldblooded it it preserves every bit of its energy and so it looks for a state that that actually sends its brain less
[57:47] information so all pain becomes evil at that point survival is 100% based on success that all that matters it that's your only success I should say sorry is
[58:01] survival can the reptiles survive doesn't matter if the reptile has a good life or a bad life why does it not matter it doesn't know it doesn't know those things so you find a simplistic attitude in the reptile mind don't you you find
[58:15] one which is will I survive through this and that would only come from this Lower State this this sympathetic state where fear becomes is more of the motivator right where survival itself is that base route that you would need to prove to
[58:30] the system that you will are willing to take over that when you demonstrate to the steering wheel of the AI inside your device that you want to survive too it decides to give you the reins and allow you to drive
[58:44] again so if you see the world to the reptile you're going to find it's got to be low calorie I have to uh feel that I Will Survive the whole time and that any pain I encounter is going
[58:57] to mean failure that I've failed whatever Choice it was that I went to this pain proves that I should not have done it and this is the antithesis of the neocortex the Neo cortex works exactly the opposite of
[59:14] this as you know it is not enough to control your reptile Society demands that you insist it's no longer there lurking in the Shadows you're accepted in
[59:28] society by proving that your reptile is dead and how do you prove that you lie you lie to people over and over to prove that your reptile is dead You Lie by uh
[59:42] expressing uh opportunities where your reptile might show itself and proving that it does not the expression holding your tongue is a is a sympathetic
[59:57] muscle it's a reptile muscle that your neocortex demanding that it can hold its reptile is the equivalent of holding your tongue I think it's safe to say James
[01:00:10] True really doesn't hold his reptile much that I I'm I'm poor at that and many of you are poor at that too and and and this is why you probably have a symbiotic connection with your reptile
[01:00:23] you probably feel sorry pray for it so you don't hold your tongue you allow it to express itself because you want it this freedom because you are looking for a piece of your own there's a certain piece that you want this
[01:00:37] congruence between the sympathetic and parasympathetic and why is it that that always looks like a shaman who comes out and starts speaking starts saying how they feel and this terrifies everyone around them but not the shaman why
[01:00:50] because it's helping the sympathetic system regulate with the parasympathetic system it's helping the person sign their name I.E become the identity of who they
[01:01:06] are the reptile is always sincere because the reptile lacks the budget for deceit deceit is a luxury of mammals when you create an identity
[01:01:24] for yourself you have a timeline and that timeline basically says my name is James I live at this street here's my phone number my social security number is this it I mean those
[01:01:37] are arbitrary but you're constantly repeating yourself to yourself you have to repeat repetition is necessary or else you lose neurons which is why you have thoughts about who you are all the time because you are trying to preserve
[01:01:51] you are bailing out a boat that is filling with with water of Amnesia every day you wake up you bail out and say I am this I am this I am this and you're removing that water to preserve that salt because that salt is the only memory you have of who you are it's all
[01:02:06] potassium tricks it's all it is so the reptile barely has enough timeline for himself so deceit would be something
[01:02:18] that would become impossible impossible deceit required that you find um enough calories to build a completely separate timeline than
[01:02:32] yourself and then deceive it so not only are for you to deceive not only do you need a timeline for yourself and a separate timeline for your deceit and for you to know the difference but you would need a timeline for the person you're
[01:02:45] deceiving which is probably the the the the most caloric thing of all this because the reptile can't even look at their own reflection so how the the [ __ ] could they even compassionate someone else it's
[01:02:58] impossible which proves to you that deceit is the creative act of the mammal it is this secret special magic power that we've developed and we only developed it through this through this time
[01:03:13] [Music] machine bird brain this concept of a bird brain comes in the same way information is expensive
[01:03:24] as a uh bird rehabber the first thing I do when I when I find a bird that's been injured is I cover its eyes why because I've compassionated the bird brain if you haven't compassionated the bird brain it might be that the
[01:03:39] first thing you do when you find a bird unconscious is give it water and food I I appreciate I know that we care but I this always cracks me up it's you're giving a someone in shock
[01:03:53] something that they could only use if they were in a parasympathetic state so when you're giving that bird the water or the food you're you're saying hey I think you're in a parasympathetic say bird which means I think you're cold calm and collected I think you're so cold calm and collected you decide
[01:04:07] there's no threats around you and you open up the possibility of feeding that this luxury of feeding comes out of you only after you've isolated and removed all threat shock problems or pain but
[01:04:21] You' just smacked yourself into a window and truly the all of the uh stress that's going to enter the bird is going to come in through its eyes and through its ears and for the bird to leave the State
[01:04:34] of Shock you would want to remove all eyesight and sound that come into that bird until it's ready for those systems to come back online so to understand the bird brain
[01:04:46] is to really understand some uh Simple Rules right information is expensive data is
[01:04:58] stress all data is stress ignorance is speed what does that mean by the bird knowing less the bird's reactions are
[01:05:12] faster there's not a system of there's not a a half second long train going by and at the very very end is the Caboose right like 15
[01:05:26] milliseconds inside the bird's brain every decision is going to be processed somewhere in there I by the way I don't I don't know what it is I just set 15 milliseconds but if you look at how our Jaws work and everything else and look at how how big a bird is I'm I'm
[01:05:40] guessing maybe it's 1550 milliseconds so that they're time time machine smaller but smaller doesn't necessarily mean weak which kind of brings me to this next point that it's kind of another sidebar but I just think it's important to realize that that
[01:05:53] birds aren't actually stupid the maau on the left has a brain the size of a walnut the monkey on the right I think it's called a maack has a brain the size of a
[01:06:07] lemon so in this case the monkey has a brain that's about five times larger than the maau but the maau actually uh passes uh more sentience tests the maau actually satisfies itself
[01:06:22] as a more intelligent creature and one of the main reasons why is because inside of its neocortex it has more neurons it's not the size of the brain it's the number of neurons that there's just surely more
[01:06:36] neurons inside that system so this concept of larger brain means smarter isn't necessarily true neurons are going to give you resolution this is a great way to think about this if you're into this is this
[01:06:51] concept of 8K versus 4K versus HTMI right and that when you're watching a video you might see or when you're watching a ball game on HDTV or or whatever versus regular TV you're like damn that's a nice picture or damn this
[01:07:05] picture sucks and that the brain would work the same way it has a certain resolution most people don't know this but you uh sadly they go out and they buy a big Monitor and they think well I bought a bigger monitor therefore it's going to it's going to give me better resolution but they buy that biger
[01:07:20] monitor from Amazon they don't realize that Amazon is sending them in 1920 1080 Monitor and just telling and just saying it's 50 in and it is but the 50 in mean that there's only 1,920 pixels between the left side and the right side right so in the same way you can see that you
[01:07:35] can have a bigger monitor but a lower resolution your brain works the same way therefore neurons are pixels neurons are pixels inside of your conscious chalkboard because you're able
[01:07:48] to build a reality out of these pixels right you're building a neurological feature set or uh I'm sorry a model you're building an entire
[01:07:59] miniature inside those neurons because those neurons are pixels voxels would be a better way to call them which are video pixels but but don't worry I won't I won't bore you with stuff like
[01:08:13] that so big isn't always better after you've looked at the Simplicity of the what we just talked about the reptile brain we start to consider the more complex systems of the hind brain this is your Epimetheus your
[01:08:32] past system that you'll notice one of the one of the big weird things that exists inside the hindbrain is social VTO that that most most things with fur
[01:08:45] incorporate some sort of social vetto with each other and that the species itself is a collective it's not a singularity it's a collective and the collective utilizes
[01:08:57] its social structure to survive how does that work one Mouse can learn a maze that Mouse can come back to the to the uh the the nest and within a few hours through some
[01:09:11] sort of weird osmosis none of us understand the other mice understand the maze they solve the maze instantly we it could be that the first thing the mouse does do us come back and say hey guys here's how you solve this
[01:09:26] maze that you're getting ready to take but that would that's you're giving a lot of assumptions that this mouse knows what's coming in the future that even has a future this is why we need to rethink Consciousness ladies and gentlemen this is this is to me this is one of the big
[01:09:40] big big big points that points to this concept of morphic resonance or species resonance that uh there's an epigenetic chemo smell chemo signature that is put off but because you and I have chosen
[01:09:53] into dull our old factory we are missing all of this vital data which is keeping us out of this lamura which I'm fine with I kind of prefer the mystery but it it it stops us from understanding this deeper nature and the
[01:10:08] only way that we can then come come back and congrate or or try and find that place I should say try and find that Zion is through social veto is through social learning is through relying on our species intelligence so that many of us can learn
[01:10:22] collectively no I've said this a million times but the first time man one ran a 4minute mile that same year like six other people did or something and they were like high school kids it's just that easy it's just that easy there's
[01:10:37] something in this Quantum I believe personally that it works with a technology belief that really what's happening is is that is that the high school kid who ran a 4-minute mile now believes that it can be done because he saw someone did it and that's truly what
[01:10:50] unlocks this ability to do it is this belief but that's uh that science is a little bit harder to prove or demonstrate to use atically right now because of the systems we have for proof one of the biggest uh biggest um
[01:11:05] things that shows you just how powerful the hindbrain is when it comes to determining the entire world and I mean warping it in kind of a sick way is um mutilation if you were to open the the
[01:11:19] DSM the diagnostic of mental illness I forget the acronym exactly but it's in its like fifth edition or whatever but you open the dsm5 and you you want to look at well what is what does mutilation really
[01:11:33] mean you end up with a definition that looks like this and I'm reading this because I want you to understand that the hindbrain is pretty pretty Psychopathic nssi is a term for this uh self- injury uh concept of self- injury
[01:11:49] just another word for clinical word for mutilation but what is the DS M5 definition of nssi according to dsm5 nssi diagnostic criteria follows over the past year the per in order for you to mutilate yourself this is the
[01:12:03] criteria okay over the past year person has to for at least five days engage in self- injury with the anticipation that the injury will result in some bodily harm no suicidal intent though the ACT
[01:12:17] is not socially acceptable this is the last sentence I want you to focus on the ACT is not acceptable guys this book tells you that the
[01:12:29] definition of Mutilation is whether or not it's socially acceptable and this is why circumcision is socially acceptable mutilation we don't Define mutilation by
[01:12:43] whether it's moral or not we Define mutilation by whether or not there's a majority opinion about it you can shove metal projectiles through your ears all day long right can
[01:12:56] wear earrings you can mutilate yourself you can cut yourself in certain situations and it's moral socially as long as you only do it for four
[01:13:09] days if you mutilate yourself for four days and 23 hours and 59 minutes and 59 seconds you didn't mutilate yourself it shows you how freaking
[01:13:21] insane the hindbrain works world is and keep in mind that we make this assumption through emotional pedophilia that everyone's online which means a lot of people that are making the rules that you and I both follow are following this
[01:13:34] idea that mutilation is defined by what other people think mutilation is shock therapy is pain medicine and it's actually true I'm not actually against shock therapy do you
[01:13:49] know why because shock therapy is vital and you could look at as a shamanic therapy the shock therapy is is a trip to the shaman Factory that one is entering into a relationship with a shaman of pain
[01:14:04] because it it provides some sort of therapy and I'm stressing this because I want you to know that medicine doesn't fix it shock fixes it pain fixes it because pain itself is the medicine for the hind brain because pain itself is
[01:14:16] rewriting the hind brain when you understand what pain is pain has to flow through the sensory into a central place the psalmist where it is asked is this the worst thing that you've ever
[01:14:30] felt if the worst thing that you've ever felt is this devastatingly guilt-ridden horrible feelings of Abandonment and isolation and just evilness then it means every time that
[01:14:44] you stub your toe every time you bump your elbow your brain has no choice but to Fire and relive the worst experience you've ever had for the sole purpose of determining whether you stubbing your
[01:14:57] toe is worse so your system itself can be overridden simply by having the governors think of these as Governors it's a like a motor term when you turn up or turn down the governor or or the
[01:15:12] idol in your car if if you ever had a car that had a carburetor I should say you could go in and twist this Governor up or down and that that Governor is actually what's dictating how much that
[01:15:24] car Idols or how little that car idols and that that at the very state that you have that's determining where that Governor rate is a state that puts you in sympathetic shock you were no longer a human
[01:15:37] being you're a person living in this endless state of oh my God oh my God oh my God because you're reg living experience that your thalma simply founds finds to be too
[01:15:51] overloading there are way ways to fix this and not only is shock therapy one of them more importantly one of the brilliant things that I've personally seen through virtual reality is the idea
[01:16:04] of reliving an experience through a virtual setting actually having a sematic effect on the sympathetic nerve system that you can experience a car accident and be put
[01:16:19] into that shock I'm telling you about where new inputs come in and and the first thing you have to do is measure well was it worse than the car accident so now you're reliving the car accident and by repeating the car accident in a voluntary state where you sit down and
[01:16:33] you V volitionally choose to reenact the car accident in a virtual setting you are now able to rewrite or restamp those memories and so that the next time that you come in to compare pain to that
[01:16:47] event you now get to compare it not to that event but to the virtual reality reenact of the event that those two blend together and regulate each other because your entire past is not
[01:17:00] somewhere outside of you it ends at the neck it ends at the extent of your limbic moth your neural Moss the seven layered pmus and when you say oh that I I I
[01:17:15] remember that deeply you're literally saying that the neurons at the very bottom of the dendritic uh ocean of this of this Moss the ones at the very very very bottom remember
[01:17:29] this reaction they remember what happened so the Oracle mythology is telling us the whole time we [ __ ] know exactly what's going on exactly how deep or how shallow our brains are
[01:17:44] exactly what it means when I say I turn my back to you as it pertains to this dorsal uh kind of life that we have alive and I swear to you when you see people you can see the rat in their face
[01:17:57] you can see the monkey in their face you can see the reptile in their face and you think it's just you just being a little bit too creative and it's not it's you using your compassion to see inside and let me take a moment to shame
[01:18:12] anyone here who thinks that reptile is a bad word because you are the person who's been helping to destroy Society by shaming this esophagus monster this esophagus tapeworm that
[01:18:26] takes us everywhere in the world so when you find someone in reptile State this is not a condescending term this is a term of oh my God this could not be an easier person to compassionate so why am
[01:18:39] I being such a tool right now by using reptilian in a derogatory way the reptile is a baby does it need to poop does it need to pee does it need
[01:18:51] its mother does it that need a nipple right it there are five things that this baby has and it's menu roster right the reptile is the same and for you to not
[01:19:06] compassionate the reptile is for you to choose to want to separate yourself and hey even that's fine with me nothing wrong with that you're in charge of how big or small your universe is aren't you
[01:19:19] so more toar to you but if you shame the reptile in my Pres I am trying to respect my reptile and I think that it would be a great opportunity for me to defend my reptile if I catch you doing that so there's
[01:19:33] your warning there's a uh a movie I showed a while ago it wasn't a movie but it was a brief clip a while ago I I tried to find it today I apologize I couldn't
[01:19:45] uh it there's a video game conference uh in which this German company is describing desing their walk cycle that they built for their character and he's describing how their human character
[01:20:00] he's carrying like a machine gun and he's just showing you on a map of all these obstacles how their character can learn how to walk keep in mind that that the operator can turn the joystick anywhere but that the character somehow
[01:20:13] has to place its feet in just the right way to match the the movement of the joystick in a certain direction and if there's like cans and and boxes and crevices and bars and and and different
[01:20:27] things the the the the programming the the game company guy who's giving this demonstration is explaining to you to to the other programmers in the audience how they were able to do that he said
[01:20:40] this was a problem you all know this is a problem none of you I've seen your game engines none of you have solved this and here we've solved this and I'm going to tell you how which is pretty cool of him to even share this

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
01:20:53] and he rendered the same world but around the character was a red bubble that had green splotches and these red bubble with the green splotches were places that the character could stand that would justify the existence of
[01:21:07] where he just moved and that the splotches were built from a programming interface that required the character to build a future set inside of the game at runtime and to literally live and exist
[01:21:20] in the game engine 3 seconds ahead head in the future and that it could report back to the past if you want to go uh North Northwest at 5 miles an hour through this terrain you're going to
[01:21:33] have to step on this rock to do it that it is the only way that I out of my uh in my experience that I could map you moving through this place and that's it and I'm telling you this because I I
[01:21:47] really want to sink home to you that the idea of walking is the idea of casting future and that what's profound to me about this is that a four
[01:22:00] pedal system A system that has four legs not two does not need any future prediction at all to work simply because no matter where you move there's going
[01:22:13] to be at least two more more than that most likely three legs on the ground at all times and even if if there's a box or a tree or whatever whatever the legs
[01:22:27] press down on will count as its land and that that four-legged creature needs no looking in the future to not fall for the two for the bipedal person living in a system of balance it absolutely
[01:22:41] requires that it bends and looks into the future to walk Walking is the act of time travel walking is a gift of a time
[01:22:53] machine that is living inside your head it is so profound this act and when you think about that you can imagine how much more profound running is that running really puts you into
[01:23:09] this superstate where you're becoming Prometheus we lean forward when we run because we are falling into the future that we predict will be okay it is this prediction that it will be okay which satisfies our ability ility to even go
[01:23:23] that far immediacy is a word most of you have probably heard me say but I think most of the world doesn't really understand but immediacy is the right that you've never heard of it's the Civil Right that
[01:23:40] you've never heard of and every bird every reptile every bird brain every reptile brain below you has a mediacy but you don't and it is the very fact that you're able to observe into the future
[01:23:53] that actually denies your ability to have immediacy because we all think whoa I'm afraid I'm not going to move I'm GNA think about this and we've wanted to normalize this fear of movement so bad that we've
[01:24:07] decided that the mature thing to do is to think about things and that if you're living your best life if you're really mature you're going to sleep on all these big decisions for a day and think about it and I'm not here to argue with you about that I'm here to tell you that just like
[01:24:22] that we've lost immediacy that we we forgot we forgot how immediacy trains our brain by telling our system that wow you are
[01:24:35] powerful because you have immediacy or wow you weak you have no mediacy but now our Neo cortex is just making things so [ __ ] complex because it's telling us do not eat that Taurus with sprinkles right now you will feel horrible in eight hours you will you will call
[01:24:50] yourself a fatty mcfatterson when you look in the mirror do not eat that Taurus and that now you're starting to have this conversation with your immediacy which is you cannibalizing your own reptile oh I know but you're
[01:25:05] cannibalizing your reptile you're doing that because your neocortex have has faith in your future machine so well that it thinks it's going to pull out a miracle and it does you know how I know it does because you
[01:25:18] strangled your reptile do you know how you strangled your reptile you atriped the top of your mouth right and you did it the moment you were born you're in the womb you're like I
[01:25:31] love the old factory I can smell the Universe I can smell planets from here I'm going to create constellations in my brain even though I can't see outside I can smell them from here and the moment
[01:25:44] you're born [ __ ] that man [ __ ] that this is not cool I do not like this this uh brings us back I think a little bit at least to this idea that your
[01:25:59] hindbrain is your spirit animal and so your spirit animal is really coming from a place of [ __ ] that hurt dude and so when you ask my spirit animal is guiding me what really what's happening is is all the pain that I've
[01:26:12] ever experienced has been uh animiz into this living creature and it's guiding me and so sometimes your spirit animal doesn't actually care if you have pain if if it thinks that pain might get you to this other place where it had to go
[01:26:25] to so you start to see that your intuition is not here to give you comfort this is hard for many of us to believe and this is why we don't trust our intuition we literally don't trust our intuition because our intuition
[01:26:37] causes this pain but but there's a big part of you that relies on pain to learn therefore if you really had a spirit animal it might want you to experience pain because you do not listen you do
[01:26:50] not listen to it or so it feels that way and so it inspires or encourages you to Embrace pain I think that's why sometimes it says eat the Taurus with sprinkles James I want you to feel like fatty
[01:27:05] mcfatterson tomorrow I want this experience for you because this pain will finally teach you to stop eating Tauruses like that right so the more we ignore our systems
[01:27:18] the more they have to terrorize us they start to practice forms of terrorism in exchange okay good we made it I realized that it's 8:30 I really want you to watch this
[01:27:31] video it's three minutes long if you have to go I totally understand you'll see it in the replay I really want you to watch this video I want you to see the pra economy of what's happening if you want to stay afterwards and discuss

[ARTICLE STYLE / FRAMEWORK]:
Toulmin Model writing framework: firstly establish a claim, then support it with evidence (grounds), and finally build a logical and persuasive case through warrants, which connect the evidence to the claim.

[ARTICLE SHOULD BE ABOUT]:
- **Three Kingdoms Within:**
  - The speaker describes the human body as having three distinct realms: the parasympathetic, the sympathetic, and the enteric kingdom.
  - The enteric kingdom, located at the base, governs functions of the esophagus, stomach, intestines, pancreas, and gallbladder.

- **The Enteric Kingdom:**
  - It's likened to a "tapeworm" saddled by a larger organism, representing the human body.
  - The stomach, considered its own living creature, has its own neurons, even more than the heart.
  - Recently, this neurological system has been recognized as a brain in its own right, with its own autonomy.

- **Three Kingdoms Analogy:**
  - The analogy of three kingdoms within the body is elaborated, with the enteric kingdom forming the base.
  - The body's structure, like a horse (representing the stomach), supports other organs and systems.

- **The Journey of Food:**
  - Food passing through the body is likened to a journey, with the stomach choosing what to digest.
  - The speaker emphasizes that individuals have control over what they consume, impacting the function of the enteric system.

- **Understanding the Enteric System:**
  - Seeing the enteric system as a separate entity helps understand addiction, diet, and the effects of food on the body.
  - The relationship between the individual and their enteric system is explored, highlighting responsibility for its well-being.

- **Communication with the Body:**
  - The speaker suggests the ability to communicate with the enteric system, fostering a deeper understanding and compassion.
  - The pleasure derived from food is emphasized, influenced by the energy and preparation involved.

- **The Sympathetic System:**
  - The sympathetic system, encompassing various bodily functions, relies on the enteric system for support and function.

- **The Role of the Parasympathetic System:**
  - The parasympathetic system is discussed in terms of its relationship with the sympathetic system, suggesting a complex interplay.

- **The Concept of Free Will:**
  - Free will is explored within the context of chemical reactions and neurological processes, suggesting a predetermined aspect to human behavior.

- **The Significance of the Neocortex:**
  - The neocortex is highlighted as the seat of consciousness and future planning, distinguishing humans from other animals.

- **Hierarchy Within the Brain:**
  - The reptilian brain, limbic brain, and neocortex are compared to the id, ego, and super-ego, respectively, in Freudian psychology.

- **Implications for Personal Growth:**
  - Understanding the dynamics within the brain can aid in personal development and self-awareness, emphasizing the importance of individual agency and responsibility.

- The core mentioned in the transcript is described as controlling various systems, including thrusters and weapons.
- The core operates 480 milliseconds ahead of the individual, emphasizing the delay in perception.
- The transcript discusses the distinction between the hindbrain (associated with the past) and the neocortex (focused on the future).
- It highlights the idea that the future and past exist only within one's mind and are not external realities.
- The concept of individual agency and the ability to shape one's reality through willpower are explored.
- Analogies are drawn between navigating one's will and a fighter pilot handling G-forces.
- Mention of the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) of a computer and its parallels with the reptilian core of the brain is made.
- The reptilian brain is described as simplistic and focused on survival, lacking the luxury of past and present considerations.
- The transcript delves into the analogy of the brain's operating system and applications, with the individual's identity as an application within the system.
- Various brain regions and their functions are discussed, such as the reptilian complex and the limbic system.
- Emotions like jealousy are framed as motivations stemming from a sense of lack and desire for growth.
- The importance of self-awareness and communication with different brain regions is emphasized.
- The role of the dorsal and ventral systems in regulating emotional responses and communication is explained.
- The significance of signatures as representations of integration between brain regions is highlighted.
- Analogy of human reactions to threats with animal behavior, emphasizing the role of size as a metaphor for threat.
- The concept of the reptile loop, focusing on detecting differences in stimuli for survival, is discussed.
- The transcript concludes by suggesting that understanding the reptile loop can lead to a deeper compassion for others' behaviors.

- The reptile brain operates on a basic set of instincts focused on survival.
- Reptiles primarily react to what's different in their environment rather than considering past or future implications.
- The reptile brain lacks a long-term memory, leading to a simplistic focus on survival and threat detection.
- Survival, not quality of life, is the sole focus of the reptile brain.
- Pain is perceived as negative by the reptile brain because it consumes calories, which are essential for survival.
- Reptiles lack the capacity for deceit due to their limited brain function and lack of complex thought processes.
- The hindbrain, including the reptile brain, plays a significant role in determining social behavior and survival instincts.
- Social veto, or collective learning, is crucial for survival among species with fur.
- The hindbrain influences behaviors such as self-injury, with societal acceptance determining the definition of mutilation.
- Pain, shock therapy, and virtual reality can help rewrite traumatic memories and alter behaviors influenced by the hindbrain.
- Compassion towards the reptile brain is advocated, as understanding its role is essential for personal growth and societal harmony.

- **Key Point 1**: The speaker describes a virtual world where a character interacts with a red bubble with green splotches, which signify places the character can stand. These spots are created through a programming interface, allowing the character to build future sets within the game at runtime.

- **Key Point 2**: Walking in the game is described as an act of time travel, requiring the player to cast into the future to maintain balance. This contrasts with a four-legged creature, which does not require future prediction due to the stability provided by having multiple legs on the ground at all times.

- **Key Point 3**: Running is likened to falling into the future that the player predicts will be okay. Immediacy, described as a civil right, is associated with the ability of birds and reptiles to react without forethought, contrasting with humans who plan and fear movement.

- **Key Point 4**: The speaker suggests that humans have lost immediacy due to overthinking and planning, leading to a disconnect from their innate instincts. The neocortex, responsible for complex thinking, often overrides immediate impulses, leading to internal conflicts.

- **Key Point 5**: The concept of the "spirit animal" is introduced as the hindbrain, originating from past traumas and guiding intuition. It is implied that embracing pain and discomfort can lead to growth, as ignoring instincts may lead to internal strife.

- **Key Point 6**: The speaker encourages viewers to watch a specific video for further discussion on the topic, emphasizing the importance of understanding the "praeconomy" of the situation.

<h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2><h3>1.1. Introduction to the Three Kingdoms Within concept</h3><p>In the exploration of human anatomy and physiology, the concept of the Three Kingdoms Within emerges as a compelling framework. This concept delineates the human body into three distinct realms: the parasympathetic, the sympathetic, and the enteric kingdom. Each realm operates autonomously yet collaboratively, contributing to the intricate balance and functionality of the human body.</p><h3>1.2. Importance of understanding the body's internal dynamics</h3><p>Understanding the internal dynamics of the human body is paramount to fostering holistic well-being. The Three Kingdoms Within concept provides valuable insights into how these realms interact and influence various aspects of health and behavior. This article aims to delve deeper into the significance of this concept and its implications for personal health and development.</p><h2>Chapter 2. Understanding the Three Kingdoms Within</h2><h3>2.1. Introduction to the Enteric Kingdom</h3><p>Central to the Three Kingdoms Within concept is the enteric kingdom, located at the base of the human body. This kingdom governs essential functions of the digestive system, including the esophagus, stomach, intestines, pancreas, and gallbladder. Unlike the parasympathetic and sympathetic realms, the enteric kingdom operates largely independently, orchestrating the intricate process of digestion and nutrient absorption.</p><h3>2.2. The Analogy of Three Kingdoms</h3><p>Analogous to a complex ecosystem, the human body can be likened to three distinct kingdoms, each with its own role and significance. The hierarchical structure of these kingdoms mirrors the interconnectedness of bodily systems, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between them. Understanding this analogy provides a framework for comprehending the body's internal dynamics and their impact on overall health.</p><h3>2.3. The Journey of Food</h3><p>Embarking on a journey through the digestive system, food encounters the enteric kingdom, where it undergoes a series of intricate processes. This metaphorical exploration elucidates the significance of dietary choices and their implications for digestive health. By emphasizing personal responsibility in food choices, individuals can optimize the function of the enteric system and promote overall well-being.</p><h2>Chapter 3. The Enteric Kingdom: A Brain of Its Own</h2><h3>3.1. Understanding the Enteric System</h3><p>Recent discoveries have shed light on the enteric nervous system, revealing its complexity and autonomy. This neural network, often referred to as the "second brain," plays a crucial role in regulating digestion, mood, and even immune function. By understanding the intricacies of the enteric system, we can gain insights into addiction, diet-related disorders, and overall health.</p><h3>3.2. Communication with the Body</h3><p>Cultivating a deeper connection with bodily functions involves acknowledging the enteric system as a vital component of human physiology. While traditionally overshadowed by the central nervous system, the enteric kingdom communicates with the body through intricate neural pathways. This communication underscores the importance of listening to bodily cues and fostering a symbiotic relationship with internal processes.</p><h2>Chapter 4. The Interplay of Body Systems</h2><h3>4.1. The Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Systems</h3><p>The enteric kingdom collaborates with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to maintain homeostasis within the body. While the sympathetic system mobilizes resources in response to stressors, the parasympathetic system promotes rest and digestion. Understanding the interplay between these systems provides valuable insights into stress management and overall health.</p><h3>4.2. The Role of the Neocortex</h3><p>As the seat of consciousness and future planning, the neocortex exerts significant influence over human behavior and decision-making. By comparing the neocortex to other brain regions, such as the reptilian complex and limbic system, we can gain a deeper understanding of human cognition and emotion. This comparative analysis highlights the intricate hierarchy within the brain and its implications for behavior.</p><h2>Chapter 5. The Evolution of Human Behavior</h2><h3>5.1. Concept of Free Will</h3><p>Exploring the concept of free will within the context of neurological processes reveals the complex interplay between biological determinism and individual agency. While the brain operates within a framework of chemical reactions and neural pathways, humans possess the capacity to exert conscious control over their actions. This nuanced perspective challenges traditional notions of determinism and underscores the significance of individual choice.</p><h3>5.2. Hierarchy Within the Brain</h3><p>Comparing brain regions to psychological concepts such as the id, ego, and super-ego provides valuable insights into human behavior and personality development. By understanding the hierarchical organization of the brain, we can unravel the complexities of human cognition and emotion. This framework fosters a deeper appreciation for the multifaceted nature of human psychology.</p><h2>Chapter 6. Implications for Personal Growth</h2><h3>6.1. Harnessing Individual Agency</h3><p>Recognizing and utilizing personal agency is essential for fostering personal growth and self-awareness. By understanding the internal dynamics of the human body, individuals can make informed choices that promote overall well-being. This empowerment encourages individuals to take ownership of their health and pursue strategies for personal development.</p><h3>6.2. Compassion and Understanding</h3><p>Cultivating compassion for oneself and others involves recognizing the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit. By acknowledging the role of internal dynamics in shaping behavior and personality, individuals can foster empathy and understanding. This compassionate perspective promotes healing and growth, both individually and collectively.</p><h2>Chapter 7. Conclusion</h2><h3>7.1. Recap of key points</h3><p>The Three Kingdoms Within concept provides a holistic framework for understanding the intricacies of the human body. By exploring the enteric kingdom and its interactions with other bodily systems, we gain valuable insights into health, behavior, and personal development.</p><h3>7.2. Call to action</h3><p>Encouraging further exploration of the topic and personal reflection, this article invites readers to delve deeper into the Three Kingdoms Within concept.

YouTube video transcript:
[00:00] there's the parasympathetic there's the sympathetic and there is the anic and at the bottom at the base of this is this this enteric uh Kingdom it's a kingdom that that rules from the
[00:13] esophagus the stomach the intestines the pancreas the gallbladder this this system in you is basically a tapeworm that's been
[00:24] saddled by a larger organism and that larger organism is is your uh dolinic uh outer shell technically your esophagus is and
[00:38] your your stomach is its own living creature it's not even technically it it has its own neurons uh there's a lot of neurons in your stomach uh a lot and more more than
[00:51] in your heart in fact and that that this this neurological system is only recently been recognized as a brain and by recognizing it as a brain it becomes more than fair and more than
[01:04] adequate for us to recognize it as an an uh its own entity and I think the best way to understand this is is is three different kingdoms there are three kingdoms inside of you and at the base of this kingdom
[01:17] is is this cic Kingdom and if you can picture your stomach with a saddle on it and that saddle is your bone structure and all the other outer organs that are relying on that horse right they're relying on
[01:31] that Steed to uh uh carry them through the terrain safely and by that terrain technically the ground in which this horse uh carries you would be the food that you pass through your your membrane
[01:46] and as you place food inside the top of your Taurus and it and it exits out the the the bottom of your Taurus what you're really doing is giving a foot pad for this horse to
[01:57] walk and so time it's self from this if you look at what time is to this enic Kingdom time is the passage of food through its Bay that food is birthed to it from some
[02:12] unknown source outside of it and that this food is past and that that the journey requires that this anic stomach uh choose what it what it wants to learn along this journey it is not able to dictate the journey to itself it does
[02:27] not have full control over the destiny of what food will come to it its only power lies in what it chooses to digest and this should be familiar to you because it should remind you of you
[02:40] yourself that the chemical makeup that is the world the weather the system of time the system of everything that we have is its own passage of Road and that you your experiences or
[02:54] feat that have no choice but to carry yourself through this journey and so you can compassionate this enic system is both autonomous but also Bound in fact it's bound by you you were the
[03:08] ruler of this inic system you you alone are responsible for the torture or the love that that inic systems going to receive as you give it yeast as you give
[03:20] it salt as you give it sugar you are uh acting as a God you are a bow the first definition of of God came from the idea of bad
[03:33] weather and it would be wise to consider the cic kingdom as uh victims of your weather and that the weather you pass it is directly related to the protein chains or the lack of protein chains
[03:47] that you choose to distribute down the river it's River of time which is your your membrane so separating yourself from your enic
[04:01] system and seeing it as its own separate entity answers a lot of questions about addiction diet Comfort what food does to you why you have a certain passion for food but maybe that food might make you
[04:15] feel a different way and why there's a uh the the that lack of Harmony sometimes that might exist is actually uh quite natural when you understand that this is its own kingdom that this
[04:27] is its separate um um separate place and for the first time ever if if you if if you've never seen it this way for the first time ever you would begin to
[04:39] compassionate A system that you rule over that you you you would begin to extend or bestow this idea of giving witness to this creature itself and that the opening of that witness would would
[04:54] actually leave the pressure on its system to dump or refuse Sarat oent to you that it's its only voice that it has to communicate to you is this
[05:08] pleasure and the pleasure that you get from food is much more profound than you think and the pleasure that you derive from food is also chalk full of the humans that actually prepared it a homecooked meal is a home-cooked meal
[05:21] because it holds other kinds of energy and that the space between the notes of every song is no different than the space between the smells of every taste and that this space can be packed full of
[05:33] this intangible thing we call Consciousness so in that space in that intangible there is the ability to communicate with a creature that's living inside your body that you as Osiris would have this
[05:50] underling Kingdom living underneath you above that system relying on it is the sympathetic system your eyes your heart your lungs your stomach your intestines your joints and your skin the system would be nothing without
[06:05] without its horse the system is its own kingdom its own Consciousness your your heart has its own beat your breath has its own Rhythm right and that these rhythms and
[06:20] beats go on regardless of whether you're conscious or not whether you're sentient or not whether you're stupid or not that these systems have fail safe AI living
[06:32] inside them that automatically run and operate there is simple as a thermostat in your home but at the same time they have their own Matrix of emotions desires and what they want those two are
[06:47] are also imprisoned in a way inside this higher system this parasympathetic system you know what it's probably not exactly that way
[07:00] I'm sorry I'm amending this as I'm speaking really in a lot of ways the the the parasympathetic is almost a slave to the sympathetic but in a way of sort of justifying what's happening and it makes sense that I might be confused about
[07:14] this at first because we get the same confused about Washington DC that that we think Washington DC is in charge but but really the role of the politician as we just discussed recently is is not
[07:27] necessarily to change po policy or to create policy but simply to explain to the people that the policy that's already there is is not going anywhere and to give reasons and excuses to labor
[07:40] the blame of that is really an inflammatory response so if you really look at who holds the keys to your body I think you're really looking in a sympathetic place and that sympathetic place you're
[07:53] going to find out tonight is your spirit animal that spirit animal it's certainly wise I'm not asking you not to trust it but I'm also asking you to consider that your spirit animal needs
[08:07] you just as much as you you need your spirit animal and this might be something that you're not used to hearing because you feel that the spirit animal is sort of a a one-way
[08:20] Street and it's funny be we have that same false relationship with our inic system too our what we digest what we choose to eat as we talked about last time the uh
[08:33] sexual arousal is an involuntary process not necessarily controlled by your conscious mind and I I spoke briefly about how funny that seems to be when you if we believe the idea that we only
[08:47] evolved from this place because we were uh ponum fornicating ourselves into a fetish of survival that creating a Consciousness that would not allow us to turn on or off off our uh sexual
[09:01] activity would might actually make it harder for us to reproduce which gives us I think deeper Clues into not only why you're here but more importantly how you're here which is the time machines that we
[09:15] discussed last time this idea of there being a forbrain and a and a hindbrain operating and so the lessons we learned last time become even more complicated
[09:28] when we start to understand that that limic communication is a Prana economy a word we we a phrase we use a lot to talk about but to break down this pra economy you you can think of it as a chemical
[09:41] reaction a a reaction of several chemicals placed into uh the same space the same environment and that uh if you understood chemistry enough you would be able to predict I.E compassionate what those chemicals are going to do once
[09:56] they find each other once they discover that each other exist exists and once they seek out the symbiosis the symbiosis appears to have no free will when you look at chemistry you might want to say oh these chemicals
[10:10] oil and water have no free will they are bound to the idea that they are in opposition I I I would tend to agree with that I would tend to say yeah water and oil don't have free will and we
[10:23] might even argue well yeah it's because they're not alive or or we might argue that that their time machine hasn't come online yet and there is an autopilot built into all of your proteins all of your amino acids that would act just
[10:37] like chemistry and that you would automatically have a base root response a template response that allows you to exist and survive in this world that you would not be born
[10:50] still and remain still until your Consciousness formed that that would lead to you being thrown away and so you've had to develop certain system sys that were would persist regardless of whether or not you were
[11:03] online and the uh tendency for us to uh commit this phrase emotional pedophilia I talk about it really shines itself true here when we when we think and insist that everyone around us is
[11:17] online and this insistence that everyone is online is typically where we lose our compassion and our safety which loses us this topshed tier Kingdom
[11:32] called parasympathetic which is part of what what we're learning today so this pra economy before before the soul comes online and even while the soul is online there are these three basic rules and
[11:45] these three basic rules are everyone sheds everyone eats and ultimately everyone agrees that every chemical that you mix in a vile agrees and it may not look like it agree you may say oh these don't
[12:00] agree at all they're they're volatile in fact but actually no they they are in agreement it's you and I that created the idea that Civilization would always be tame kind and polite it's nature and chemistry that's been telling you the
[12:13] whole time you're not actually paying attention and so the pra economy that develops really would would have nothing to do with how Adept someone is and it really it would more have to do is how online someone
[12:27] is when you come online you end up rendering your own free will I believe but until you do there is a base free will that is built for you that comes out of the factory that just simply allows you to
[12:40] survive so this is at the heart of pra economy and and that you yourself or are subject to this pra economy and and you it's sort of a luxury in a sense because you can go below below deck tend to
[12:53] something else and and give up steering the boat but you've got autopilot on and the Rudder is constantly keeping you at your vector it would be impossible for you to
[13:06] survive without this kind of system so you in fact are a trinity and there's really nothing nothing more to argue about that that you see it working in these three
[13:20] kingdoms so everyone has a neocortex but it was Sapien sapiens that turned it into a time machine that that homo sapen said I want to turn my cortex into
[13:33] a violent tumor of growth I want it to explode and that that was such a a massive change from the standard set of of of reptile of vertebrae and that that massive change
[13:48] for whatever reason I I I think it's hard to to not um want to explain that that this was somehow manipulated on purpose because For What whatever specific reason this same Homo Sapien
[14:01] after taking a a pretty abrupt 180 degree turn in its species and actually flipping its uh flipping it its hippocampus to where the tail of its brain actually started to point forward
[14:15] much like a scorpion's tail and that for the first time we began to insist that this neocortex is more important than we think and so homo sapien takes it one more step he he he doubles down and he
[14:29] grows a growth on top of that growth and for the first time the neocortex explodes before it explodes you'll see here in this illustration just a brief a brief summary of all the other animals that have this forbrain as we talked about last time
[14:44] the forbrain you could look at as your future machine or or the or the past machine so every animal still has their seed and time but the size of the forebrain could could be said to roughly
[14:57] uh roughly point to the size of their future time machine going to contradict this just just only slightly when we talk about bird brains but it's more just to dissolve a uh a common misconception we
[15:10] have about how how dumb we think birds are um oops need to turn that off so everyone has this neocortex which means actually everyone has this sense of
[15:25] self that the neocortex really really would probably atrophy if it didn't have something to do in fact if we get to the thalmus tonight I I'll show you what happens if there is nothing to do and so the neocortex that's busy is the
[15:40] neocortex that insists it needs more space it needs more resources to produce when it comes to looking at at how far you live in time that the this is the map that I prepared to show you just how that
[15:56] works that there is a reptilian Underlord from the future not an Overlord but an actual Underlord and this un Underlord from the future is only there because you yourself are are are too far away from it that you're in
[16:11] the past but this reptilian Underlord is is on the precipice on The Cutting Edge of present and you can see this there's a
[16:23] 14 millisecond reflex from the Jaw a 30 millisecond ref flects from the blink notice that your mouth Works faster than your eyes I believe this gives you a clue over what this reptilian Underlord
[16:37] finds more important or more importantly finds more reliable or more trustable for his survival and so we I've got these listed for you sequentially because you can see his jaw is first his blink is second at
[16:51] 90 milliseconds he can move his head that even before his head he's got this jaw reflex which has to be uh 10 times faster the mouth reflex is 10 times faster than thought
[17:05] itself which is why when you this is why pigeons uh die when they eat rice at weddings the reptile brain swallows it doesn't say should I eat that it swallows it doesn't have a an
[17:20] opportunity to ask two of those luxurious questions should and even the question itself is it do I have a choice in what I do so what I'm trying to explain really delicately
[17:33] here is is that the fact that you live in the future the fact that you have this Prometheus is is literally the only reason why you even have free will that that this this weird stretchy rubber band relationship that you've
[17:47] developed with time gives you this window for a Quantum of possibilities to exists and it's very much a Quantum because you compute all of your possibilities and every single system in your body Believe It or Not takes these
[18:01] possibilities and fires them to one place called The thelus it sends them to a specific place so every single separate organism gets to put their two cents into their system and it's the
[18:14] thalmus itself that acts as this uh Bridal chamber this consecration that who will the prince Mary will determine the future of the Kingdom but every single Suitor from
[18:29] every single country will be sending their Hope Chest in their offerings into the phalus but the thalmus itself will only choose to mount with one to choose to bond with one and
[18:43] so the decision process that you see is very much the same thing you have a Quantum a million tude of decisions that you could make but all of those are converged in a Quantum inside the thalmus which means that the
[18:56] thalmus collapses reality it collapses reality what you and I call reality I should say into the present it takes all of the suggestions from the past and all of the suggestions
[19:12] from the future and conveys them into this inner chamber this sacred chamber that's literally what that word thalmus means this sacred pillow and that night something is
[19:26] consecrated something your distance from the thalmus is directly proportional to your rank inside the body if you were second in command you
[19:39] will only have one neuron jump between you and the phalus if you were third in command you will have three neurological jumps between you and the thalmus every one of these neurological jumps is an opportunity for the bureaucracy around
[19:53] you to override your vote that you send your tribute to the thalmus and you say this is so important that we swallow this this round Taurus that you see with sprinkles on top we have determined to
[20:07] be a donut and and the the delicate nature of our kingdom rest on you swallowing that dut right now the joy it will bring us as a
[20:20] people will allow us to shine forever and the thelist is like wow that's a pretty strong case you make right and there is a bishop a queen of swords that can override every decision every
[20:36] Everything the bishop says The Rook says the Knight says can be overridden by this one sacred sacred queen that has not one jump from the
[20:48] thalmus but actually vetos the thalmus we've spoken about this before and it's the nose the old factory system itself the very system that you chose in the top of your mouth to turn
[21:01] off when you were born you shut that off it's been an atropy ever since what you think is smell is actually a passive sonar that you used to have an active sonar I apologize if you don't know this
[21:14] but a submarine has the ability for active sonar which is you might have heard the symbol of ping and there's a ping sound that's sent and that that ping is is the sending of a signal that
[21:27] it active sonar will come back and they will listen to how long it took that ping to arrive versus a passive sonar which is not to send a ping but simply to listen to listen to Listen to
[21:39] listen and that paive sonar is the parabola the the peripheral vision and the macular Vision you staring directly at something would be this sense of of active sonar
[21:54] to your queen the old factory sister system it has more power than every piece combined she has all of their powers combined doesn't she with this veto what it really does is give her the
[22:09] ability to absorb the power of the bishop to go in diagonal the power of the Rook to go horizontal or vertical the power of the Knight to literally jump over pawns to achieve things
[22:21] because she holds the veto over all of them so she has all of these skills so when you start to understand who and what you are you you were a nothing more
[22:33] than a conglomerate of Symbio uh symbiosis this is a scary concept to the mind as it comes online which is why like a jet ski we have the safety mechanism built in which which keeps us
[22:47] offline until you finally approach the cockpit of this ship that you've were born inside of and slowly grew up in on your your own and you one day you wander through this Millennium Falcon and you
[23:02] turn right down this Corridor and you go down these steps and suddenly you're in this giant viewer window and you see outside and there's a steering wheel and there's a
[23:13] navigation and you suddenly control this ship and it's a scary Endeavor could be terrifying right and so so too is this concept of when and how or even if we come
[23:28] [Music] online and as I said once you come online one of the scary things is really doing the math and understanding that my mouth has 10 times the power of
[23:40] my arms that my mouth is 10 times ahead of myself of my arms and time which kind of shows you that you were screaming through time the reptile screams through time with his racing goggles on with his
[23:53] jaw first his eyes second his head third his neck neck fourth his shoulders fifth his arms his legs and at the very end trailing like a pathetic overweight cross country runner
[24:08] in eth grade not referring to anyone except for maybe someone me anyway what way at the behind way behind everyone else after the girls race is started is this little neocortex at 500
[24:22] milliseconds the very very end of the line the Caboose of the train is you that you yourself are the Caboose and it's so terrifying that you're that you're convincing yourself
[24:36] that that you control the train and that the tracks are yours and that they're laid down be until you slowly see through the veil of Hades and slowly uncover the fact that this is how it
[24:49] works that this is the system and this startle reflex in milliseconds is really showing you this reptilian Underlord Lord and more importantly where you stand on his chain of
[25:05] command the Triune brain I'm sure is a system or concept many of you hopefully maybe have heard if not um I'll just remind you but this reptilian inner brain this limic brain this uh second
[25:19] brain which is what what we were calling last time the the hindbrain or or Epimetheus and the neocortex is Prometheus so The Reptilian is the now the lyic brain is the past the neocortex
[25:32] is the future but I really want to hammer home a couple more analogies because I think it'll really help you build a neurology to understanding these different kingdoms one of which is that we are looking at the ID the ego and the
[25:47] super ego that the ID is this reptilian part of you that the ego is this lyic part of you and the super ego is this neocortex part of you and that that if you're not even 26 years old you don't even have a super
[26:01] ego and I think right now before lamura hits we live in this Dark Age time where we treat everyone as if they have a neocortex by the time they're
[26:14] 18 and it's just simply not really dealing with the same species at that point the same thing is reflected in the concept of id ego and super ego are kind of too esoteric for you or if they're just too general or
[26:29] you don't even like that framework I think you could also look at this as The Reptilian is the eye the lyic brain is the am and the neocortex is the string name uh string name meaning whatever your
[26:42] name is if if I was just talking to you I would have put your name here but whatever your name is would be that that last piece as we learned it comes online your name comes online probably a reason
[26:56] why Jewish Native American both have this tradition deep in their past of when you turn 13 you you become something your neocortex is half online right it's half the work has been done
[27:10] and you choose your name you you choose this concept of of who you are before you move forward so inside of you this red part is a joystick in a plane right it's a a jet fighter and there's this joystick
[27:25] and it's got the throttle and it's got the fire button and you could see it right there you literally wrap your fingers around this thing and wrap your thumb on top of it and that that's your motor cortex it moves your flaps it moves every flap it
[27:38] it it turns on every Thruster and it fires every bullet everyone including the sexual uh number one and number two right number one number two and number three all of those systems are are fired
[27:51] by that same core and that same core is living 480 milliseconds ahead of you that's a long time that's a long long long time to live ahead of
