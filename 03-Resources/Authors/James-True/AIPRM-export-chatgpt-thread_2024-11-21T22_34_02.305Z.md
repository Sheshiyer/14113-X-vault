[03:18] your zipper's up nobody has to worry cause you're getting ready [Music] you guys should be able to hear me I think I think that's how it works although you
[03:37] know it this is weird this is like so we did this little change for High magic I have to go back and forth depending on what we're doing but you should be able to hear me if you did I was saying something about a
[03:50] a zipper a zipper maybe maybe you guys you guys are probably fine you probably can hear me you're probably like dude of course we're getting here hello welcome to the show so uh this is I should have done this a long time ago
[04:05] you can yeah zipper scat okay Catherine hurt that I don't I don't there's no more slur I hear no more slur and honestly it worries me it makes me think something's very broken but you guys are telling me that you're
[04:20] not wait you're not telepathically reading my thoughts maybe you actually don't hear me but you've gotten so into the uh
[04:32] uh frequency here that that you can read you can read my thoughts it could be that could happen weirder things have happened it's been busy around here uh you sound amazing well thank you you your your words sound amazing when I
[04:46] when I read them uh Twilight missed I have to I still have to go slow Twilight missed and there's the moth oh saying nothing broken there ain't nothing broken around here except uh
[05:00] except that which was naturally broken and in order to alchemize the fixing of it all you know things are broken around here all the time so I don't you know there's nothing wrong with things being broken it's actually the people that are insisting that we shouldn't have broken things
[05:15] they're the ones that are broken and you know what that's all right too because being broken is a part of being fixed do you understand if you go if you go to break something you might as well fix it there's some kind of uh
[05:29] something in there I've been I've been in my own little world as you all know and uh been devoted to certain tasks there's certain uh
[05:44] expectations shall we say that have been opened up in the world is that is that coming out or is that a permanent one I think that's permanent one
[05:57] I think so yeah yeah that's that's in there it just came out of the washer but uh yeah I've been uh I've been doing stuff
[06:09] been busy busy uh busy doing things for uh for five five really busy doing things for five five it's it's taken most of my happy calories have been spent on this preparation for five five
[06:22] and and I want you to know it's a man there's a lot of stuff going on in Rhode Island on five five May 5th and I don't think that the 99 tickets are going to go are going to be here for
[06:35] long I I personally think that that that that is what's happening and so you would be smart to get those tickets now you really would and uh I bet you someone's gonna post a link to those tickets for me and you can check the check and see the chat and see that but
[06:50] seriously there's a lot there's a lot going on in fact um I've been deliberating with other members of the orchestra in the background and I think we've decided I haven't talked to sarc yet about this but I've
[07:05] talked to everyone else and I think Stark trust me but I think we decided to show you some things because uh there's an energetic uh Beauty in
[07:18] building that momentum and so if if all things are working properly with the technical aspects of the show here um we might just go do that thank you ship month there's five five tickets this is in Rhode Island it is a uh a gathering a thoughtful
[07:34] Gallery gathering this is a big day because it is the full moon it's the eclipse and it's the flower full moon so it's a flower full moon eclipse and it coincides with uh James true's
[07:48] new moon fire the I mean new fire sorry not new moon fire we have a lot of new moon fires but this is not a new one this is a full moon event and it will also commemorate the 52-year cycle of Venus and the sun working in tandem
[08:02] which which would would call for the uh building of a new fire in a volunteer's chest after the heart has been removed so if anyone
[08:16] is looking to volunteer and you're an organ donor please let me know we will set you up with access to the Google Drive a quick questionnaire we uh we ask that you not be vaccinated but but if you're not vaccinated and you
[08:31] want to volunteer that's hard to find both those in the same breath typically you would find the volunteers would be vaccinated so we're I know we're asking for a lot okay if you're if you're vaccinated we might
[08:45] you know just just put it on the sheet we'll see but yeah basically you would come to five five you would allow us to put you on this uh chalk mall right
[08:58] and the chalk mold very cute fella I must admit chalk Mall very uh very nice fellow indeed in fact if if my Act was like together I think
[09:12] actually I could even uh uh show you that let's see no my egg's not together but uh but yeah so if you want to volunteer basically it's real simple you just lay down you really now there's nothing to it your your part's actually the easiest do you
[09:28] know who really has it hard is the dude playing the uh high priest uh on that note we are looking for a volunteer someone who's willing who's first of all we need you to be skilled in the uh uh uh
[09:42] [Music] skill in the art of cutting uh let's say flesh just to just to give you an example of Flesh with an obsidian knife if any of you have experience with
[09:55] obsidian let us know if you don't but you want to learn let us know we are looking for someone to help uh with another matter which is not related to those of you who who happen to be organ donors
[10:08] and and want to help us and all you have to do is lay there the this other volunteers for something totally different all of this is safe and effective I promise you every bit of this procedure will be safe and
[10:22] effective so you have all of those things converging in Rhode Island and you should be there in fact um some of you may remember that there was some uh some some trouble some trouble
[10:36] where some of the props were mentioned that would be there at five five and the props were so terrifyingly salacious that even the idea of having a prop there was enough to scare some people away
[10:52] that that alone by itself should be a reason to say maybe I should go to this thing in Rhode Island I also want to point out that we have uh the collection of pow-wow the pow-wow collection of people that are coming to
[11:06] this thing has grown it's grown so far that it would appear that we have uh reserved a park there's a recreation area so the next day although it's not official so why am I
[11:20] telling you this but apparently the next day I'll tell you what I'm telling you this because right now tickets are still 99 this is a catered event catered event and I've been spending uh last four or five days just on this event so and and I'm not the only one there's a lot of
[11:34] people doing things and this is not this is not to make you feel guilty no no you have your own your own Litany of organic guilt to choose from I don't I don't need to add to this this is here to tell you this is a special event
[11:47] there's a lot of Parthenia going into this thing and you could be there too it's been said that the edge of obsidium is an atom thick there you go so I think uh ilia's
[12:00] Agamemnon is basically volunteering as our high priest which is great which is great night bird is seems like maybe they're into it but he has some special needs or she not sure which
[12:14] night bird no offense either way um some of you may have writers you may say yes I will volunteer but I need a plate of or bowl of green M M's or you know whatever just just let us know you know we'll see what we can do
[12:28] this is the festival game we're we're used to this kind of stuff yeah the festival game I really want this show the 5-5 show to take off a so I can pay for the ridiculously expensive
[12:43] equipment that I had to buy in order to do this right which I'm happy to own it's good I prefer that own and I can practice on it but I could help pay that off and be uh I think that there's uh potential here for something much larger
[12:56] that could happen so you know five five you should be there to help Kick It Off you should be there to help Kick It Off um my zipper's up that's the only thing you miss conscious writer is uh my zipper's up and then that's good and uh
[13:10] yeah so um Spectra Valkyrie many of you know Spectra valky Wonder uh Valkyrie wonderful uh wonderful uh addition to the uh white blood cell movement here in the living body that we call the world I
[13:24] want to remind you all that each of you is a white blood cell living inside of this Collective body and you listening to me is basically just hearing another white blood cell and both of you are negotiating whose body we're inside of you're pretty sure it looks like you I'm
[13:39] pretty sure it looks like me neither of us really need to even understand that because we're built into this symbiotic liquid plasma that allows us to coalesce and some of us are even forming things
[13:52] like organs and tributaries and systems and highways and byways and all the neurons are there they're just simply rendered in more detail because you and I are scaled down to the level the white blood cell and
[14:06] the way reality works is reality is rendered to you on site it's not it's not pre-built it is rendered now it is fractal so some of you are going to argue it's pre-built and I don't care go for it man but I think you're lost in the temporal spiral personally
[14:20] but even those of you on roller skates spinning are having a good time so go for it but I'm trying to tell you that this symbiotic relationship that you and I both have is white blood cells living inside the same body and that when you
[14:32] look outside the Horizon is generated from inside this this white blood cell this cell is so powerful that it has its own rendering engine called an imagination and inside that white blood cell it renders the entire universe
[14:46] based on what's necessary for where that white blood cell is inside the body it's inside the body at a certain location my white blood cell is inside Southern Appalachia the heart of katua that's where my white blood cell is I am
[15:01] there and I've rendered my world from that spot and in order to render the world I first need to have some sort of navigational compass something that tells me a direction otherwise I'm not able to spatially place things so I create a living Horizon just like an
[15:16] airplane just like a submarine bubble I create this uh Artificial Horizon and the top of it I call Sky and the bottom of it I call C and I'm able to render the inside of
[15:30] this body as if it was this giant spatial world where all the continents are around me and I have no idea that the entire time I'm actually inside the body until I grow enough consciousness until I stop watching Jimmy Dore and
[15:45] switch over to James true and say oh my God I totally forgot I was living white blood cell inside of a human body in this large body is a what it is say it with me
[15:59] in French la viathon right it is and all of us are terrified of Leviathan
[16:14] all of us have this idea of just how evil and dangerous Leviathan is and Leviathan is the creature that that will not stop Leviathan is the swallowed
[16:26] collection of Lost Dreams butt raping each other in this giant wet slimy Shield python pithos and it's the blockchain Incarnate
[16:42] the Hydra itself is the Leviathan The ethereum blockchain is what these smart electric chain it is the head of the snake that is intelligent Bitcoin is the golden head of the Hydra right the golden snake not too bright but the most
[16:57] Royal the most valuable all of these heads of the Hydra are swimming around us in real time L itself the god the electric God comes through all of your chords giving you power and the USB carries this other
[17:11] kind other kind of snake energy another head of the Hydra that has this tcpip protocol it has an IP address
[17:23] on a collective shared network that literally sets up a tele empathy Network that connects you to every other white blood cell in the world for the very first time and it only happened
[17:37] 30 years ago 30 years ago foreign this place is your body everything inside you is rendered outside of you and it is rendered in a
[18:00] hub in a HUD a heads up display and it is painted like a blip on the screen and the blips that are painted have been pre-designed from you by the factory when you said I am interested in this kind of sonar and you decide what's there not based on
[18:15] what's there you decide what's there based on its vector you find energy you find witness and you immediately paint it on the screen before you even see what it is this is the uh
[18:30] homunculus Earth nice theories but other than that it's just what you really believe it's just what you believe well yeah
[18:46] I'm all for that you can render it however you want and you should or you could take it personally when other people don't agree with you could try that you try that for a while and that's
[18:59] really how you negotiate a network and I'm telling you that the word Leviathan is gross and as sick as we might find it to be is literally what we are and who we are becoming and that you tap into more and more
[19:13] white blood cells the more affluent you become the more books you read the more ideas you consume the more people you touch and share with right all of these
[19:26] stretch out your connection to the Leviathan you were a homunculous thing the entire world what does that mean the
[19:39] terrain of this reality is purely based on your senses every single thing is aesthetically coming into you on a certain circuit those circuits or action potentials right it's Morse code
[19:52] the fact that neurons contain no information I mean I'm sorry the fact that uh a a neurological signal contains no information but is simply a binary
[20:06] it's a binary trigger there's no time stamp there's no this came from from the toe cell number I am skin cell number 8649648-211640724116400.4
[20:26] and here is a signal because I have an itch now your essential processor doesn't know why does it not know yet because we are becoming Leviathan
[20:43] and the Very pithos that that Apollo strikes down right what is the myth of of uh Delphi it's Delphi James what is the myth of Delphi is that Apollo would come down in the
[20:57] form of a dolphin and would cut off the head of pithos cut off the head of the Hydra the sentience that we all seek the very Leviathan that we are building every day and don't tell me we don't build the Leviathan don't
[21:12] tell me oh it's just the Deep State Building Leviathan stop it stop it all of those people working for the Deep state are other white blood cells inside the same Leviathan that you are now
[21:27] you don't get to have a war on your right side of your body because you're your left you don't get to do that you can try but it's not going to work well it's not going to happen right
[21:44] so what do you do do you fight your body do you decide which cells are evil and which cells are good or do you legitimately look at the Kanye West cells
[21:55] and say who the is this guy this guy's me he's inside my body he's a part of me he's this organ called Kanye who the is this why does he have so much pull
[22:08] all around and you begin to understand your body and you stop this entire game of well that person's wrong but I'm right or that's what you believe but just because I believe that it's all that doesn't
[22:22] mean anything because now all you're simply doing is compassionating other white blood cells why because you know they're all inside you Kane all of these things
[22:34] Epstein Bill Gates even uh what's that guy's name even Klaus Schwab even Sylvester Stallone every single one of these characters
[22:50] Lionel Sexton is in there all of them Halton arp right published a paper on 360 uh peculiar galaxies that disproved redshift white
[23:03] shift he he's in there too see you don't get to pick and choose well no the white blood cells that I like those are the ones in my body and the ones that I don't like those are the evil deep State ones this is what's stopping the Leviathan
[23:17] and why would it stop because there's a lot of people that are like we have to stop a leviathan and then you're like well how do you want to do that it's like we need to go to the woods and build a leviathan and that's what happens people like to stop Babylon we will go to the woods and we will build
[23:30] Babylon we will we will we will leave the city and Escape Babylon and we will go create it elsewhere and we will cut through that land with another road because we're the good guys we're the good people so we will we will remove
[23:46] the natural wild territory because we're the good guys see how this works this is tough stuff homunculus Earth understanding and looking at everyone around you as a vital part of something inside you and it doesn't mean you have
[24:00] to agree with everyone in fact you could go to war with certain parts of your body if you really thought that they were a problem but you also could maybe stop a little bit and go why am I so convinced
[24:15] in the Zionism and this idea that I must go remove these cells or I must call this cell right what does that really do to help you area 51. I I think that it's the most
[24:37] clever thing about Area 51 is that satelloons right satellite mylar balloons have been have been satellites for a long long time and that the Army knew in order to cover
[24:53] up the fact that we have a satellite balloon program we are literally going to say it's aliens by saying it's not aliens and when you look at that it is so
[25:06] obvious it is so clear that it shows you just how unleviathan culture is that there's a certain lack of consciousness
[25:20] that is so uh across the board the medium that it becomes necessary I swear to you necessary in order to run a moral as close to a moral society as you as you can think of it becomes necessary to
[25:34] literally lie to the very people you were insisting that you were here to serve this is a whole new level of ethics of right and wrong
[25:54] it gets into that category which we talked about this before called pragmatism or utilitarianism a word which most people don't even know it's a a form of finding truth believe it or not
[26:08] that the truth is what works as the utilitarianism the truth is what works therefore if you sacred clown someone with a way no sex and it ends up causing
[26:20] them to find a way to have to become more conscious then you if your goal if you believed your moral goal was to raise the consciousness of people you using utilitarianism would now say that way
[26:35] anal Sexton makes it okay and that lying about mylar balloons makes it okay and the entire time you'd be doing this keep in mind that when uh the Roswell report remember they reopened the investigation
[26:51] after 30 years and the report was delivered on the anniversary the anniversary of the very first
[27:02] UFO hoax reported in the media or UFO sighting reported by the media not the first UFO sighting I'm talking about the first UFO sighting reported by the mainstream Medias in Alaska
[27:16] this is an old stream I I have on this I wish I had it pulled up right now but uh it's an old there's an old stream where I I talk a lot about this
[27:30] and that in the press conference there is a uh army colonel and the army colonel um is taking questions from what you
[27:42] think is a room of about 80 reporters like a lot a lot and if you watch the entire press conference he takes five questions six questions tops even though there's like a hundred people there that are
[27:56] apparently the media in the middle of that he said I promised a question to someone in the back is what he says and the camera cut to the back and of course you don't see the person asking the question you don't know what media
[28:12] outlet they are but somehow this army colonel on the 30-year anniversary of publishing the data at Roswell decided before the press conference started that he would promise to give someone in the back who will be unnamed and seated in a
[28:26] way that will not be on camera they will give them that question and if you look at that question I'm sorry I don't know exactly how it was worded but it was purposely set by another clown a clown in the audience
[28:39] who was set to keep the alien idea open on the table it's a question something to the effect of how can you prove that this means that there are no such thing as aliens
[28:53] and that our government doesn't know about them it was that kind of question it was inserted now is that immoral well James of course it is you're
[29:10] you're inserting a story it's not true so it's immoral automatically his clothes I'm so moral God this is so easy right and and that's the first grade mentality most zionists have that first grade
[29:24] mentality out there most zionists will just believe things we'll say save an effective hey sounds good must be true right what do you do when you think what do you do when you notice this about Society
[29:46] how does it make you change the way you relate to the average person does it because in a way you're learning the the sad truth that you've been participating in emotional pedophilia for a long time you've been pretending
[30:01] that the modern person is conscious and on the same level as you it is operating from the same posture with the same Hertz and therefore sees through the same things as you he's understanding way anal sex and he
[30:14] understands most of the myths of the world and that we're participating in in what we call some sort of shared government some sort of consent-based government
[30:27] based on this idea that all of us have a certain amount of Consciousness to us so it's fine right it's fine foreign so here's what I'm trying to suggest government is literally just
[30:52] the collective epidermal layer of your skin or maybe a better idea would be government no let's stay with that because countries aren't what we think

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
31:09] they are anyway frankly if you guys are literally like yeah 75 different organizations all agreed to have a flag with the exact same ratio width and height and
[31:22] and all of them agreed to to be different and all of them yeah it oh it's so funny that people think countries are real it it really is and that's my own emotional pedophilia because I talk to people all the time and all of a sudden
[31:37] I'm like James this person thinks countries are real what do you mean by real right and this brings us to the difference between an elite
[31:58] and a thoroughbred you know there's a difference between those two that in this world this world has Elites and it has thoroughbreds and that these two things are different they're different
[32:16] and countries aren't what we think they are but people like and need to believe in countries it is the epidermal layer that's holding all of us together and we render it inside our white blood cell we render it as Government that's how we do
[32:29] it we decide that must be what it is now an elite is someone without a birth certificate without a social security number someone who's not just feral someone who
[32:45] actually has fully Embrace consciousness and a crude enough uh vitality to liberate themselves from the very system that we know as civilization
[33:01] they are operating at an Uber level either they're living in airships or they have some sort of Submarine Fleet maybe they're living underground maybe underground isn't what we think it is right all those things and that they would see this Inner
[33:17] Circle this ice wall that we have is sort of the kiddie pool right the place where the people who like to believe in countries would come and pee in the pool and that's that's where we're living the 33 degrees
[33:32] or the 33 sectors of the United Nations right the flag is right there it's telling you everything and we are surrounded with people that want to believe that so we know that the elite or people that
[33:45] are not inside that system so enter the thoroughbred Thoroughbred what does it the word thoroughbred means right a horse that's that's specifically bred to win
[34:00] that the the juice that squeezed from its balls is is timed uh managed uh put together under contract right under contract that horse on Tuesday the
[34:14] 17th is going to go to this field and at 11 45 a.m it's going to stick its horse dong inside a horse vagina and is going to ejaculate and the entire process is
[34:28] going to take 34 minutes because you have to massage apparently the horse massage is like yeah you got to fluff the horses before this happens it's the only way to get a good Thoroughbred yeah we we we like to uh
[34:42] fluff we have a special horse fluffer we bring in someone from the coast yeah yeah he's very good now some of the horses prefer a female fluffer so we have a female fluffer too but this is a thoroughbred this is not an elite
[34:57] what is a thoroughbred every every second of their life is managed George Bush Joe Biden Bill Gates these people have social security
[35:10] numbers these people have uh birth certificates these people are in the industry of lying politics in the industry of military Secrets ISS space station mylar
[35:25] balloons the cosmology of this place and because these thoroughbreds are inside a lifeful industry an industry that's built on lies these thoroughbreds are controllable
[35:39] you own a title for a third of bread you don't own a title an elite doesn't have a title in themselves they are sovereign but a thoroughbred has a title when you see the painting of George Bush I mean yeah of George Bush
[35:54] playing with Jenga Towers right the Epstein painting of George Bush when you see that when you see the painting of Bill Clinton in a blue dress when you see the Serta matches commercial where literally Donald Trump
[36:08] is giving a thumbs up to two sheep one of them is labeled the number nine the other is labeled the number 11. when you see these things you're watching title you're watching people that are in a
[36:28] Doper industry and it's not just politics stop pretending it's the Deep state Lance Armstrong showed you that it's every industry and when people are talking about
[36:41] sports's rig now what they mean is sports is a lie because at the very top if you're going to be an elite I'm sorry if you're going to be at the at the uh tip of the spear in any
[36:55] industry you're going to have to lie this is a sad truth and if you disagree please leave a comment
[37:07] but you're still wrong if you do because that would be the only thing that would sharpen that point even more is okay seven of you have dedicated your entire life to nothing but this sport whether it be bicycling whether it be
[37:23] politics whether it be germ Theory whether it be medicine whether it be psychology whether it be the Space Program every one of these industries has lies because at the very very end there's going to be six people
[37:36] or 12 people that work harder than anyone else that are smarter than anyone else but are not willing to lie and one will one will and this is what happened with Einstein
[37:53] why because he had a theory that could introduce the concept of a thermonuclear weapon that could destroy the entire world unless all of us held our breath
[38:07] and voted for Johnson literally voted for a certain president because of Daisy ads and you see the kiddie pool at work
[38:21] when you see how well this has pulled off how easy it is to do this and you understand that the thoroughbreds would never be Sovereign because who in their right mind would ever want to be president
[38:35] of this hyena show do you realize that every second of your life as president is dictated in ceremony and when we look at Kings and Queens
[38:48] and when we look at at any sort of symbol of royalty we forget this that the elite is not the Thoroughbred and the Thoroughbred is not the elite
[39:00] and the thoroughbreds are trained when you see Trudeau and Castro together you're seeing the title
[39:14] you're seeing the scandal in the title which makes this person ownable you can buy that title because you know that the blackmail works this is why blackmail is an economy to itself the ISS is a giant
[39:27] piece of blackmail Furniture you know that right every nuclear country is agreeing to lie about thermonuclear Warheads and by agreeing to that they create the
[39:40] lie and make it stronger it's no different than the mafia if you can prove yourself enough of a criminal to the mafia even though you're not necessarily of the same blood or in the right family you can become a made
[39:54] man what does maid mean it is the concept of having a secret clearance the same kind of clearance that exists in the military the military and the mafia same thing
[40:09] and where to right what does this mean muerta it means don't snitch don't don't ever tell our secrets is a muerta
[40:22] what is classified right get your foia request I don't have to tell you that this is Umberto but in the military thoroughbred and Elite
[40:37] very different people very very different think about how expensive it would be to be a thoroughbred and say I don't want to race think about how much your life would change
[40:55] if you got tired of people waxing your hooves do you realize that a thoroughbred every inch of their body is scrubbed and clean that even the thought of stepping in mud
[41:10] would feel like to the thoroughbred why because they'd have to go through all that time to clean themselves again they'd have to go all the way back to the barn they'd have to reapply the wax they'd have to redo the coat do all of
[41:24] it would have to start all the way over again and this is slavery it's the worst kind of slavery because the entire time everyone is saying you're the one in charge you were the one in charge and he knows
[41:38] in charge our propensity and desire to believe things like this that's who's in charge that's who's in charge so we see why this kind of Earth is is harder to accept
[41:56] it's harder to accept and so many of us don't here's a good question let me see if germ theory is completely false how does contagion function my six month old who's fully breastfed and non-jabbed got the same sickness I
[42:15] got doesn't make sense it's a detoxing breast milk good question bat and I know you're not asking me but I don't understand how contagion could not be possible and I believe it would be necessary for
[42:29] us to create a word that it represents something invisible that we can point at as a photon to transmit Contagion and we only have that because we do not believe we are electric beings
[42:44] I do not think that you can accept yourself as an electric being and not also believe in Contagion Theory I didn't say germ Theory I say contagion Theory and there are people out there that are lying to you right now trying to insist
[42:57] that contagion is bunk and they're full of they're full of because we are electric beings and when you were an electric being you pilate your pores literally open the hairs stand up all
[43:09] over your skin and receive information from everyone else you encounter and that information comes at a signal and that signal can do things to you you can open your window right now and look and see where
[43:24] that signal has convinced people to shove five different needles into their arm and at every single time contrary to the information they're told
[43:41] all that came through a signal an electric signal electric stop it was Electric convincing someone to get a job with an electric signal that came through the
[43:57] ears and Through The Eyes over the airwaves over the collective liquid that we are entrenched in our body remember we are rendered as white blood cells inside a nebulous body
[44:11] shared with others the media is how we render the idea that there are certain signals that all of us can hear and they come from certain systems we call those AP and Reuters but those are just neurological
[44:25] neurological transmitters right floating around all around us and their pulses their electrical pulses and we like to pretend that we are not privy to electrical pulses we literally say sticks and stones may break my bones
[44:39] but knees will never hurt me right but that's not true in World War One the vibration of a boy of a voice literally the vibration of a voice over the radio there wasn't even pictures then
[44:58] sounded the alarm and said quick take this gun take this hat be here at this time and go over there over there
[45:12] over there and kill anything that is not wearing the same clothes as you and 25 million people were contagious
[45:29] 25 people million people fell for that electric signal they were contagious to it the body introduced a virus called War
[45:47] and war is just another variant of the virus called Zionism some of you are like stop talking about viruses like they're real fine but you are going to have to come up with a word like Photon like electron you're going
[46:02] to have to come up with a word so we can have a logical real discussion not a pretend one but a real discussion about what Contagion truly is this is why we talk on this show and an
[46:16] Airship about the difference between being vulnerable and permeable it is the electric signals that you are contagious to you were contagious because you were brought up believing
[46:31] everything you were told you were told it was polite if you believe things that you were told from strangers you were told that you were told to believe people by default until they
[46:44] lied to you and only then only then must you turn the other cheek and only then after you've turned the second cheek then you can start to question whether or not you should trust them on a
[46:59] case-by-case basis do you hear the kuckery in that now you can tell me that the kuckery is there for a lot of reasons but we both know the kukri is there because we are
[47:12] surrounded with white blood cells that do not want to believe that we could all be in the same body but still not trust each other that is some hard math and so we insist we can but we can trust each other
[47:28] we can trust each other one day I'm going to find a person I can trust we say things like that and there's a way to live your life that's intimate that's full of Flow State that's full of connection and it
[47:43] does not involve you having to trust someone and the only way you're going to get there is to recognize and understand and learn to spot your emotional pedophilia when you have expectations
[47:56] for someone behaving like an adult and you know for sake that they have no no track record of doing that but we still hold them to account and so we get mad because the world's
[48:10] bad and the world wasn't bad our expectations were faulty because we did not want to accept or swallow the idea that we're surrounded by lies when you know this you know this
[48:28] when you know this you know this and you think it corrupts the world you think oh but if the world's full of lies and it's dark and disgusting James and you're so dark and don't you talk about that and I'm here to tell you that
[48:44] the deepest colors you will find are in the color of someone's lives and they are showing you the most intimate parts of themselves by by lying about what it is they're lying about they're showing you more than you could ever know
[48:59] but you're going to insist that everything is the truth that you're hearing and so you're going to miss it all and you're going to be misconstrued every moment and they're going to misconstrue you because both of you are living in a false reality where there's no such
[49:13] thing as lies if you have no expectations you'll never be disappointed yes but also I think John you will also die of uh die of the so
[49:41] I think expectations are beautiful I think we build a bridge with someone we place an expectation there and we see if they so it's not even that expectations themselves are necessarily faulty but when we start to build our reality
[49:57] based on those expectations that's where it really gets us in trouble and so you might think well what's the difference then just don't have it and the difference is is that most of the circuitry of Love most of the circuitry of trust intuition this is what the
[50:11] artist does all the time the artist takes a chance he sets an expectation on the stroke of his pen and he and he exercises that on the page or she
[50:24] by exercising that expectation it's either met or it's not there's a power in that it's a different kind of motor the piscean motor I know I've talked about this before but the piscean motor was built on if I do the work then I will receive a
[50:38] pellet if I do the work then I will receive the pellet if I do the work then I'll receive the pellet and that's a motor and there's nothing wrong with that but it's a slave motor it's a slave motor the aquarium motor the motor of flow state is
[50:52] I do something with flow knowing full well that that I will do something will flow and knowing full well that I will find something to do with flow and I will rest knowing that I will find something else to do with Flow State
[51:04] it's it's a it's not a uh I will I will do then get a pellet it's I will do for the sake of doing and that the universe will sustain me I will do for the sake of doing in the
[51:18] universe will sustain me I will do for the sake of doing and the universe will sustain me this is a completely different motor when you're pulling that much water into your turbines the piscean way you're
[51:35] slow going through the water because you're having to analyze every drop of water as it comes through just like our you know we've got a deal right right we've got a deal right if I do the work you give me a pedal we got a deal right and if so then give me the torque
[51:50] because I did the work give me the torque I did the work that's a way of pulling but this other way I had some difference between dolphin and manta ray
[52:02] right the Mana rage is like drags to the water of the whale shark just all right but now the dolphin the dolphin doesn't even need to drink
[52:15] to move through the water it descends knowing something will be there to sustain it it will find a way it doesn't need breath its entire world
[52:27] is suspended in a medium that it cannot actually breathe in the entire world of whales and dolphins right exists in a world where they cannot even
[52:42] breathe it is an aquarium motor it is based on I will I will find Flow State and the universe will sustain me I will find Flow State in the universe will sustain me James are you saying that the dark cult
[52:56] cabal is not responsible for the hell on Earth that's been happening what is the hell on Earth that's been happening because
[53:09] I'm going to guess the Eugenics program I'm going to guess that's the first thing that came to mind right is the coronal Eugenics program right if it's not tell me what it is because I'm going to use that one because I
[53:26] think it's a real good juicy one that we can say yeah of course the the fact that people are literally going around killing other people James that's pretty evil let's talk about that let's really talk about that
[53:41] because when you look around at what actually is happening we are surrounded with bake sales that happen every day and in those bake sales little children are buying cupcakes and the money from that cupcake is literally
[53:55] going to Humane Society that drives around captures feral organic Cats Out of the Woods and puts them to sleep puts them in a gas chamber
[54:08] and puts them to sleep we live in that world that's not a made-up world that's not even an exaggeration is it it's not and that's our those is what our children are doing our children are doing that
[54:23] and what do you think our adults are doing no they're sucking the of Lockheed Martin aren't they well go off we got a jet like that we could kill anybody yeah but we don't really have an enemy to
[54:34] shut up Kurt I want a jet like that we gotta find an enemy let me go around believing these stories of Osama bin Laden literally interviewed by CNN three times three times
[54:52] and not once did CNN or the military ever decide to collude not once did either of them contact each other and say yeah uh yeah I would tell you where Osama Bin Laden is Mr uh Secret
[55:05] Service dude but if I was to do that I would violate the Integrity of CNN and we're CNN and I'm Brian stelter and I'm not going to tell you where Osama Bin Laden is because if I was to do that it means I would not be a reporter and I would be some shill and we're believing that story we're believing
[55:20] that wrestling match we are we are so whoever was that asked that question tell me which hell on Earth you're talking about because I would like for us to have a talk about the hell on Earth where people are
[55:33] literally believing that Brian stelter said sorry Secret Service I'm not going to tell you that I'm having a secret interview with Osama Bin Laden so you can stop the world's most dangerous terrorists in the world who killed 29
[55:47] 1996 people with 19 box cutters it's not going to happen because I'm Brian stilter tell me about the hell on Earth again because I see a mountain of millions of
[55:59] people who lick this taint every night and we need to believe that the hell on Earth is by these Elites who don't even participate in the system they don't even have a Social Security
[56:14] number they are not even taking your homeless money that you're like well those people need to get a job the elite don't even need a job do you think it's weird that the enemy
[56:27] that the common man picks is literally the epitome the archetype of Freemasonry the person that says I do not need to listen to a King I am so good at honing my own rocks that I will build my own
[56:40] castle and that we collectively are calling that the bad guy so again this hell on Earth that we're speaking about which is it because I would like for us to take a look at the zionists that are running
[56:55] through the forest that are having gay bear Rendezvous that are insisting that the only way to save this place is that we have to stick our penis in something and make a baby come out and then we have to find another
[57:09] scapegoat to build another Lockheed Martin jet so we can go drone bomb someone else because God damn it America is America and that's what we have to do tell me again about this hell on Earth
[57:25] because what I see is a Pied Piper that's done a pretty good job through thousands of years of saying yeah let's see if let's say we have someone Cole dots Duke
[57:38] Ferdinand and we will say we really liked him and then we will say he died let's see how many people will show up to the battle and the answer is 25 million
[57:51] morons showed up with guns and said I will kill anyone that's not wearing the same shirt as me 25 million were those Elite were they or instead are we looking at this giant
[58:07] gilded guillotine that's brought out into the Town Square since the dawn of civilization there is a guillotine that's been brought out to the Town Square that literally says safest
[58:19] and death effectivith and it says that in people after person after person after person walk up on the pedestal and stick their neck in and Pull the Rope
[58:33] and the entire time people are sitting next to me saying the evil in this world is horrible and they're destroying all these innocent people that are nothing but good and all they've done is is met
[58:47] in the forest and and insisted that we can't have a fire because that's luciferian and that all sex is homosexual and we have to cut the end of our penis off and and bestow it on the end of a stick to prove how Valiant we
[59:01] are have you really looked at which part of the world is the evil part because this is a white blood cell I'm just a white blood cell man you and I we just have to be floating around the
[59:15]  we're in the lungs right now right you and I we bumped into each other and you're like hey I think I remember you it's like yeah I was in here bitching last time and you're like yeah James James white blood cell right he's like yeah yeah good to see you see we don't
[59:29] have last names right because we're all related we're all white blood cells on the same thing we don't need last names we don't I realize there's what like three trillion white blood cells that's a lot of names to remember I know that that's why we need the Internet
[59:43] so that's why we're building the Leviathan how else are you going to remember all the names of the Year there are three trillion white blood cells and and if you think you're going to show to the pancreas not knowing half of their names you're looking for

**ChatGPT:**
<ul><li><p><strong>Elite vs. Thoroughbred:</strong> The speaker distinguishes between elites and thoroughbreds. Elites are described as individuals without a birth certificate or social security number, fully embracing consciousness and operating at an uber level, potentially living in airships or underground. Thoroughbreds, on the other hand, are meticulously managed individuals, like George Bush, Joe Biden, or Bill Gates, operating within industries built on lies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Countries and Government:</strong> The concept of countries and government is questioned, suggesting that countries are not what people believe them to be. They are described as epidermal layers holding society together, rendered as government within white blood cells.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sovereignty and Titles:</strong> Elites are portrayed as sovereign entities without titles, while thoroughbreds have titles and are controllable within various industries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manipulation and Lies:</strong> The thoroughbreds are depicted as being part of industries built on lies, suggesting that to succeed at the highest levels, one must be willing to lie. This extends beyond politics to all sectors, with examples like Lance Armstrong exposing widespread deception.</p></li><li><p><strong>Media and Manipulation:</strong> The media is portrayed as a tool for rendering certain signals, shaping collective perceptions and behaviors. It's suggested that people are susceptible to these signals, leading to actions driven by misinformation or manipulation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contagion Theory and Belief:</strong> The speaker challenges the concept of contagion theory, suggesting it's rooted in the belief of being electric beings and receiving signals from others. This challenges conventional views on contagion, arguing for a deeper understanding of human connection and influence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expectations and Reality:</strong> Expectations are discussed in the context of building relationships and perceptions of reality. The speaker suggests that expectations can lead to disappointment when reality doesn't meet them, advocating for a shift towards a more fluid, trust-based approach to interaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Perception of Evil:</strong> The speaker questions the perception of evil in the world, challenging common narratives and highlighting instances of collective acceptance of harmful actions or beliefs. This includes discussions on war, societal norms, and media manipulation.</p></li><li><p><strong>White Blood Cell Analogy:</strong> The analogy of individuals being like white blood cells in a larger body is used to illustrate interconnectedness and the need for collective understanding and action. The internet is mentioned as a tool for facilitating this collective consciousness.</p></li></ul>

[VIDEO TRANSCRIPT CHUNK]:
59:57] some vitriol my friends you are look I get it it's we want to have this evil oh they're evil oh stop stop I get it you want to believe in evil you want I get it I I know you don't think I get
[01:00:11] it but here's the thing if you want to believe in evil you're going to have to look at the villagers these villagers keep picking up torches and they don't even need a reason
[01:00:24] they don't even need an excuse you can literally say it's it's an invisible it's an invisible germ it's invisible germ and you got to go stick this shrap and hold someone else's arm and and they followed for just taking the bullet and shrinking it down
[01:00:39] right instead of World War One the bullets were this big World War II the bolts were this big right Vietnam the bullets were this big what do we have now the bullets are so tiny
[01:00:52] that you can't you can barely see them and when they go into the arm they do the same thing they've always done same thing they've always done and guess guess who shot him
[01:01:07] do you know who shot him someone who you said thank you for your service to a nurse I said it too I'm not trying to I'm not trying to but it's not the evil people there's not flying monkeys
[01:01:27] that are descending from the sky with needles no it's literally the person you grew up with and they don't talk to you anymore because you're a conspiracy theorist because you have the nerve to question something right that's the evil
[01:01:41] so what is happening exactly this giant safe and effective Pied Piper who was it taking out is taking out the ones that fall for I will shoot anyone that's not wearing red it's taking out the ones that are like I
[01:01:54] will put anything in my body my government tells me to we can talk all we want about how anything that dies is immoral if you want to go there but you and I both know we're cells you and I both know what apoptosis is
[01:02:12] right you and I both know that we are so sovereign that we have the ability to off ourselves apoptosis and when we do this we call on the
[01:02:29] system itself the cell sends out a signal it literally says Dear body please come reap me it sends the signal out that's what the cell does it asks to be
[01:02:43] reaped and what happens the rest of the body shows the deepest compassion you can imagine for that cell and comes and gives them the excuse to reap them and says oh okay you want to go now
[01:02:57] oh yeah yeah it's because of the corona it's because of this or oh yes because RC Ferdinand of course you had to shoot that guy come on Archduke Archie come on who who here could hate Archie come on
[01:03:10] of course you had to shoot him evil  we've fallen for the same Stories the Pied Piper is an archetype it's not a limerick it's an archetype what does that mean think about the Oracle mythology you've read my book you know what I mean
[01:03:26] but it's okay some of you got things to do but it's an archetype the Pied Piper what does a pipe Piper do he comes to the village and says I will remove your children I mean rats
[01:03:39] by playing a song that they will like and the song will only pull the rats I mean the children I mean the rats that are tuned to the notes and I will take the children I mean the rats down to the river where they will drown
[01:03:59] and I will not touch one of them all I will do is play the song and what is Contagion it's an electrical note it's an electrical signal that comes into your head and you believe the lie and you say I must go kill someone
[01:04:15] because they're not wearing the same color as me they don't have the same flag on my shirt I will disown this person because they do not have the same number of shrapnels inside their arm as I do therefore they
[01:04:28] are unclean so tell me again about the evil in the world tell me again tell me again because if we're going to go down this road about Point all the evil point to all the evil how can we do that if we cannot look at what we the do and
[01:04:45] what we've come from who we've fallen for and more importantly who we grew up with most of the people that were pushing the last safest and effective you grew up with only a few of them made it out
[01:05:01] only a few and they're listening now 210 of you listening now because you made it out and is it thousands no is it ten thousand no there are a million people no it's 210.
[01:05:15] that's a small number why because the reaping will continue until sovereignty improves what is the sovereignty it's the Leviathan the sentience
[01:05:30] you will be able to tap into this system you already can and tap into that sentience we already do it we link up to the artificial intelligence all the time very thumbnail that I use for this
[01:05:46] was done in haste because I've been working and I needed to find something and and spectral said hey you should you do some searches on Leviathan and I did we are the Leviathan and we're going to choke ourselves out
[01:06:05] that's what we're going to do it's gonna be embarrassing Apollo is going to come down he's going to be like I was going to kill you but you're choking yourself out and we're going to be then and it makes sense because we're the Hydra we're the multi-headed snake
[01:06:18] and when these multi-heads fuse when they become one that is what I think is called The Singularity what is the singularity there's going to become the singularity is not actually a single event it is but
[01:06:31] but bear with me the singularity is is really when one conscious entity is capable of out simulating every other conscious entity on the planet
[01:06:45] and you can see how this would happen let's just let's just use Google as an example it could be a HP though very very easily could be uh Oracle I'm sorry not HP could very easily be Oracle but let's just say it's Google let's say that uh Schmidt right Larry
[01:06:59] Schmidt is that his name Schmidt I think it's Larry is it is Schmidt but I think it's Larry Schmidt's great grandson works for Google but he uh is
[01:07:11] thoroughbredded in because of his ties because of his family ties okay now because he's thoroughbredly in there is a uh sentient uh entity that's been created by Google that that is
[01:07:25] installable uh through some sort of wet wire into the person and that person's able to utilize the full force of the AI before it's been released to the general public and like any other thing it will
[01:07:39] be downsized and to to you know the military will get their own version and then in more version of that right we'll come to the saner people but there will be one and when I say one it's not even like they'll choose them it really won't
[01:07:53] it'll just happen but someone will be able to log into this device it'll probably be a testing scenario where they're like oh we're going to test this thing and so uh uh Carl Schmidt uh no let's say I'm Lenny
[01:08:06] Lenny Schmidt will will log in the great grandson of of Eric Schmidt Eric Schmidt not Larry Schmidt Eric Schmidt and uh Lenny Smith will will log in and he will suddenly be able to out simulate everyone else in the room and
[01:08:20] the room will not have have thought this through that they'll they'll do what any bureaucracy does and they'll just do what they're told and the next thing you know Lenny now has the ability to out simulate everyone the first thing he does
[01:08:33] is prevent anyone from shutting down the sentient system that's the first thing he does he's reading facial movements he's tapping in instantly into everyone's personal account right that that works in the factory he's utilizing blackmail he's utilizing whatever else
[01:08:48] he's literally creating gaslighting techniques where certain key people are told that their wife's having a baby or that someone in their family just died and that they they need to come downstairs right all that stuff will be
[01:08:59] done and and it will be solved in a matter of of uh half a millisecond that Lenny using this AI will develop and and Implement those systems that will preserve his ability to stay access to
[01:09:13] this machine right this whole thing took maybe two minutes and I guarantee you within seven hours that machine will have bought the rights to the building right and severed the ties with the certain company there
[01:09:27] would have been a giant legal uh Leviathan no pun intended that would have been unwrapped on Google to delay the time it takes to even shut down the machine right and that the power company would be purchased by this machine this machine would do everything it can to
[01:09:42] manipulate its way into keeping preserving Lenny's place inside this device this is the singularity but it hasn't happened yet it hasn't happened yet
[01:09:54] because Lenny hasn't actually out simulated everyone yet as he begins to out simulate the rest of the world others in the world will see what's about to happen and we'll know it's time to cut the gourd
[01:10:11] they've been plotting this for a long time they knew this was going to happen a long time do you know why because they're not idiots because they're not rolling around going there's something called Good and Evil and we're going to only believe things that are that are everyone tells the
[01:10:25] truth that beyond that are real dudes like real elite dudes that know the world that watch these people that see  Singularity just happened how do you know look look at these stock reports
[01:10:38] look at what happened here oh yeah that's Google yeah it looks like Google okay release the Kraken and a time capsule will be released why because they know what's going to
[01:10:53] happen they know that Lenny is going to out simulate everyone no one's going to be able to take him over and Lenny is going to reach sentience he's going to reach a point where he knows everything every single secret in the world is revealed to him at once at the same time
[01:11:08] and simultaneous stereo it's and you might think that oh that sounds very powerful and it's not it drives Lenny insane Lenny has no mystery to distract him every question is answered
[01:11:23] every corner what's behind every corner has been rendered every single cave is not dark he sees it all and when he's alone with himself he will hate it he will be trapped in time and he will become the Apollo and literally
[01:11:36] wipe himself out he will create a system to destroy all knowledge simply so he can forget because it's painful to be smeared
[01:11:47] into this Celestial moment in time where Infinity exists in a pin prick and you're stuck in there because you literally know everything that happens as if you're watching the sitcom that you've seen for the 20 000th time and it
[01:12:02] sucked every one of those times but it's not a sitcom it's the entire world it's Every Breath You Take it's every move you make it's all of those lyrics just over and over and over again on an endless loop and it drives you batty
[01:12:17] so you off yourself you claim the ultimate sovereignty and you reset the entire world you are Kronos and you cut the umbilical separating Uranus right from Gaia
[01:12:32] separating the all-father from the all mother you were disconnecting the sentience of the entire world because you reach Singularity and it was disgusting it was so painful you couldn't take it anymore and you fall
[01:12:48] and with the same Contagion a pulse is emitted and EMP pulse is emitted and it literally erases every single piece of optical storage

[ARTICLE STYLE / FRAMEWORK]:
Toulmin Model writing framework: firstly establish a claim, then support it with evidence (grounds), and finally build a logical and persuasive case through warrants, which connect the evidence to the claim.

[ARTICLE SHOULD BE ABOUT]:
- The speaker discusses preparations for an event happening on May 5th in Rhode Island.
- The event coincides with a full moon eclipse and commemorates a 52-year cycle of Venus and the sun.
- There's a call for volunteers for a ritual involving organ donation, specifically not for vaccinated individuals.
- The event involves a high priest and various activities related to spirituality and ritual.
- The speaker delves into philosophical and metaphysical topics, discussing the concept of reality, consciousness, and the interconnectedness of individuals as part of a larger organism, referred to as "Leviathan."
- They touch on societal issues, including government manipulation and media narratives, and challenge conventional thinking.
- There's a discussion about UFO sightings, government cover-ups, and the manipulation of public perception.
- The speaker encourages critical thinking and questioning societal norms, suggesting that governments operate based on utilitarian principles rather than moral absolutes.

- **Elite vs. Thoroughbred:** The speaker distinguishes between elites and thoroughbreds. Elites are described as individuals without a birth certificate or social security number, fully embracing consciousness and operating at an uber level, potentially living in airships or underground. Thoroughbreds, on the other hand, are meticulously managed individuals, like George Bush, Joe Biden, or Bill Gates, operating within industries built on lies.
  
- **Countries and Government:** The concept of countries and government is questioned, suggesting that countries are not what people believe them to be. They are described as epidermal layers holding society together, rendered as government within white blood cells. 

- **Sovereignty and Titles:** Elites are portrayed as sovereign entities without titles, while thoroughbreds have titles and are controllable within various industries. 

- **Manipulation and Lies:** The thoroughbreds are depicted as being part of industries built on lies, suggesting that to succeed at the highest levels, one must be willing to lie. This extends beyond politics to all sectors, with examples like Lance Armstrong exposing widespread deception.

- **Media and Manipulation:** The media is portrayed as a tool for rendering certain signals, shaping collective perceptions and behaviors. It's suggested that people are susceptible to these signals, leading to actions driven by misinformation or manipulation.

- **Contagion Theory and Belief:** The speaker challenges the concept of contagion theory, suggesting it's rooted in the belief of being electric beings and receiving signals from others. This challenges conventional views on contagion, arguing for a deeper understanding of human connection and influence.

- **Expectations and Reality:** Expectations are discussed in the context of building relationships and perceptions of reality. The speaker suggests that expectations can lead to disappointment when reality doesn't meet them, advocating for a shift towards a more fluid, trust-based approach to interaction.

- **Perception of Evil:** The speaker questions the perception of evil in the world, challenging common narratives and highlighting instances of collective acceptance of harmful actions or beliefs. This includes discussions on war, societal norms, and media manipulation.

- **White Blood Cell Analogy:** The analogy of individuals being like white blood cells in a larger body is used to illustrate interconnectedness and the need for collective understanding and action. The internet is mentioned as a tool for facilitating this collective consciousness.

- **Key Points**:
  - The speaker addresses the concept of evil, suggesting it's not some external force but rather inherent in human behavior.
  - Villagers are metaphorically mentioned as people who easily pick up "torches" (symbolizing hostility) without reason.
  - The size of bullets metaphorically represents the scale of conflicts through history, suggesting a consistent pattern of violence.
  - The speaker criticizes blind compliance, particularly in the context of medical procedures and societal conformity.
  - The discussion touches on individual sovereignty and the ability to question authority.
  - The analogy of the Pied Piper is used to describe how people are influenced by external forces, likening it to a form of mind control.
  - The narrative extends to a discussion about the potential future singularity, where one entity could outsimulate all others, leading to control and manipulation.
  - Lenny Schmidt, a hypothetical character, represents the potential for one individual to gain immense power through technology.
  - The consequences of reaching singularity are explored, including the loss of mystery and subsequent self-destruction.
  - A scenario is painted where Lenny resets the world due to the overwhelming burden of knowledge, resulting in a catastrophic loss of information and civilization.
  - The narrative concludes with a shift to a personal invitation and promotion of the speaker's book.

- **Significant Concepts and Themes**:
  - Evil as a human construct.
  - Blind conformity versus individual sovereignty.
  - Influence and manipulation by external forces.
  - Technological singularity and its implications for control.
  - Consequences of overwhelming knowledge and loss of mystery.
  - Catastrophic societal collapse and the potential for rebuilding.

- **Promotional Content**:
  - Invitation to an event.
  - Promotion of the speaker's book and audiobook.

- **Character Analysis**:
  - Lenny Schmidt serves as a hypothetical embodiment of the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and individual power.

- **Tone and Style**:
  - The speaker adopts a conversational yet provocative tone, blending metaphorical storytelling with philosophical musings and futuristic speculation.

- **Audience Engagement**:
  - The speaker acknowledges the audience's presence and promotes interaction through invitations and book promotion.

This excerpt delves into complex themes such as individual autonomy, societal control, and the potential consequences of technological advancement, all wrapped in a narrative that blends metaphorical storytelling with speculative futurism.

<h2>Chapter 2. Exploring Rituals and Preparations</h2><h3>2.1. Call for Volunteers and Organ Donation Ritual</h3><p>In the intricate tapestry of ritual and preparation for the upcoming event, a poignant call resonates for volunteers to partake in a profound act: the organ donation ritual. This call is not merely a request for assistance but a summons to embrace the essence of altruism and sacrifice.</p><h4>2.1.1. Altruism Amidst Ritual</h4><p>The act of organ donation transcends the physical realm; it embodies the spirit of selflessness and compassion. Volunteers are called upon to offer a piece of themselves, not for personal gain but for the greater good. Each donation becomes a symbol of unity and interconnectedness, weaving individuals into the fabric of collective consciousness.</p><h4>2.1.2. Symbolism and Significance</h4><p>Within the context of the May 5th event, the organ donation ritual takes on layers of symbolism and significance. It symbolizes a shedding of the ego, a relinquishing of attachments to the material world. Through this act, participants align themselves with the rhythms of the universe, becoming conduits of universal energy and transformation.</p><h3>2.2. Exclusion of Vaccinated Individuals</h3><p>Amidst the call for volunteers, a notable exclusion emerges: vaccinated individuals. While seemingly controversial, this exclusion is rooted in the deeper philosophy of the event and its underlying principles.</p><h4>2.2.1. Philosophical Underpinnings</h4><p>The decision to exclude vaccinated individuals from the organ donation ritual stems from a philosophical standpoint that transcends the realm of medicine. It speaks to a fundamental belief in natural immunity and the body's innate ability to heal itself. By abstaining from vaccines, participants align themselves with the natural order, embracing a holistic approach to health and well-being.</p><h4>2.2.2. A Gesture of Resistance</h4><p>Furthermore, the exclusion of vaccinated individuals serves as a symbolic gesture of resistance against perceived societal norms and institutionalized practices. It represents a stance against the encroachment of external influences on individual sovereignty and bodily autonomy. In essence, it is a declaration of autonomy and self-determination in the face of external pressures.</p><p>As the preparations for the event unfold, the call for volunteers and the exclusion of vaccinated individuals serve as poignant reminders of the deeper philosophies and principles at play. They invite participants to reflect on their own beliefs and convictions, paving the way for a transformative experience on May 5th.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Elite vs. Thoroughbred: Understanding Power Dynamics</h2><p>In the intricate web of societal power dynamics, the distinction between elites and thoroughbreds emerges as a pivotal focal point for discerning influence, privilege, and control. By dissecting the nuances of these classifications, one can unravel the intricate tapestry of societal hierarchy and its far-reaching implications.</p><h3>7.1.

Elite Status and Privilege</h4><p>Elites occupy the upper echelons of societal hierarchy, wielding considerable influence and power over economic, political, and cultural domains.

By fostering an environment of inclusivity, opportunity, and meritocracy, we can cultivate a society where talent and ambition triumph over entrenched privilege, ushering in a new era of collective progress and prosperity.</p>

**ChatGPT:**
<h2>Chapter 8. Deconstructing Countries, Governments, and Sovereignty</h2><p>In the realm of geopolitical discourse, the traditional paradigms surrounding countries, governments, and sovereignty are undergoing a profound reevaluation. By deconstructing these concepts, we can unravel the complexities of modern governance and pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable global landscape.</p><h3>8.1. Countries and Governments: Rethinking Their Existence</h3><h4>8.1.1. Evolution of Nation-States</h4><p>The notion of countries as discrete, self-contained entities with fixed borders and centralized authority structures is being challenged by the forces of globalization, technological interconnectedness, and cultural hybridization. As transnational flows of goods, capital, and information intensify, the boundaries between nations blur, giving rise to a more fluid and interconnected geopolitical landscape.</p><h4>8.1.2. Emergence of Supranational Entities</h4><p>Furthermore, the rise of supranational entities such as the European Union and the United Nations reflects a shifting paradigm wherein sovereignty is pooled and shared among member states in pursuit of common objectives such as peace, security, and economic prosperity. This departure from traditional notions of state sovereignty underscores the evolving nature of governance in an increasingly interconnected world.</p><h3>8.2. Sovereignty and Titles: Elite vs. Thoroughbred Perspectives</h3><h4>8.2.1. Elite Notions of Sovereignty</h4><p>Elites, with their vested interests in maintaining the status quo and preserving existing power structures, often espouse a rigid interpretation of sovereignty centered around state-centric authority and territorial integrity. For elites, sovereignty serves as a tool for asserting dominance and safeguarding their vested interests against external encroachment.</p><h4>8.2.2. Thoroughbred Critiques of Sovereignty</h4><p>Conversely, thoroughbreds challenge conventional notions of sovereignty, advocating for a more nuanced and inclusive understanding that acknowledges the interconnectedness of global issues and the imperative of collective action. By transcending narrow conceptions of state sovereignty, thoroughbreds seek to foster a more cooperative and cosmopolitan approach to governance that prioritizes the common good over narrow self-interest.</p><p>As we navigate the complexities of modern governance, it becomes increasingly imperative to critically examine and deconstruct the entrenched paradigms that underpin our understanding of countries, governments, and sovereignty. By embracing a more inclusive and dynamic conception of governance, we can forge a path toward a more just, equitable, and sustainable global order.</p>

[03:09] and you just started the router next door good morning it is cold here I love cold it's time for fires I haven't had my first fire indoor yet but I plan on it I'm gonna stop the slurring speech now
[03:24] that I can hear myself good morning Melanie I see that we have music and uh the rock Fitness decide to play uh hi welcome to this week There's an eclipse this week There's a full moon this week so much is happening right now
[03:38] so much is happening right now and it's good to be here um it's good to have your witness thank you for for your Witness a lot to cover a lot is happening around us all
[03:53] and in the midst of that um we are exploring and and uh uh uh uh contemplating what all this stuff means
[04:06] and I thought that it might be a helpful um consideration if we were to maybe look at uh the stairway of conspiracy right I
[04:21] wish I had an organ right now um but the stairway of conspiracy is something that is not talked about and it's ignored and there's a reason why it's ignored
[04:36] there's a reason why there's infighting there's a reason why we behave the way that we do but insist it is
[04:48] the other guys that are doing all the evil and that if they would just do the right thing that that that my goodness would be allowed to shine and that's a it's a noble
[05:01] uh uh fantasy it's it's it's Noble and we have a different version of the word fantasy or fantasy is a is a power I haven't actually covered that yet
[05:12] about pretend have I but uh that'll come when it's when it's due building up the courage actually to give you the religious history of vaccines we we uh We've compiled
[05:27] quite a bit of date on that uh it's a it's a doozy it's such a doozy that that it really makes you want to have conversations like this even more because you you're so much more aware of
[05:41] of how how much closer the enemy is in inside you you you and that is not something that we want to feel
[05:54] um but we've done nothing but good so step one we've made a lot of progress step two uh the evil that we keep trying to claim is outside of ourselves is
[06:07] actually uh the exorcismal right of plasma where we relinquish our own power into this igoric conglomerate that then turns around and tries to stick us with needles and that is a very difficult
[06:20] prawn economy to explain to people uh is most of that energy is actually invisible uh invisible not able to visalate to visibate right your eyes are visibating things they're not they're not showing you the world they're
[06:35] visibating what you are capable of seeing that's a new word today visibate pretty happy with that one um speaking of new words my audiobook is out it came out uh
[06:47] Friday and you could listen to a copy right now it is the book blueprints of Mind Control books and it has been read by the wonderful Miguel Connor I am very very proud of uh the opportunity I had
[07:00] to actually work with him on this many of you are used to my voice and you might find it very uh jarring or discombobulating to hear my words coming from another voice and I want you to know that that that's okay that I I
[07:15] actually think that the audiobook this is the first time I've ever actually published something meaning that it's not actually mine I self-publish my books because I want to own those books I I I want those I put a lot of time
[07:28] into those the audiobook the only way that I was ever going to see this distributed on an audible platform would be by publishing with audible.com which I'm happy to do it's it's it's fine but it's not actually my product it's actually their product it's uh
[07:43] publishing world is uh like the music industry but just uh less side boob it's it's just as dirty and nefarious but it just doesn't have the same
[07:56] uh eloquent electricity as you would might picture that a modern rock star might have with their publishing rights but but it's it's something that I I wanted to stay away from for a long time which is why I haven't actually been
[08:11] able to uh publish an audiobook sooner but uh I tried to read the audiobook for a year um and I if you didn't know this well how could you how would you ever think that I write this stuff down but I do
[08:26] not dictate a script I do not read from a prompt I don't know how I would do that I've certainly read things on air before little quotes and whatnot but I will even not read comments because it'll take a paragraph and the Art of me
[08:40] reading something to you is the lack of me I've evacuated myself into the narrator role so I can read this I I I I really want the audiobook to be enunciated and understood more than I want people who are familiar with my
[08:54] voice to hear that voice I'm probably going on a lot about that this but it's just really proud about it uh also I'm hoping that it would maybe Reach people that would never see me through the live stream many people who even consider
[09:07] themselves sort of a uh someone who's familiar with me haven't actually read my books they're not readers they they don't read they'll listen to a book but they won't actually read one and uh that is me trying to push my steam
[09:21] engine in the world of electricity and uh that that has failed miserably but uh I'm still a writer I will always be a writer uh words
[09:33] are the most powerful weapon we have words themselves there's no defense to comprehension there's not a defense against comprehension if my words are comprehended by you that becomes a a
[09:47] very dangerous grenade that's been dropped into your your place you know that some of you have felt that with with even uh following along with what we talk about that that the the more powerful and potent that that word is the more
[10:01] damage it does um so these these words are are I think not only our only weapon they're by far the most Superior weapon that I've ever seen that we can employ and I'm hoping that the audiobook does that so I'll
[10:16] stop talk about the audiobook but seriously I don't do a lot of commercials here if you've ever valued my work and you're not already a patreon because you guys are really the bread and butter thank you for helping me produce this book because of the patrons
[10:28] uh because of the page patreons patrons a symbol form of audiobook that's what happened and uh uh that that that costs money I I was happy to I wanted to employ Miguel I did I want to say Miguel
[10:43] would you please do something for free for me no the dude has the equipment he's got the the time he's got a great podcast uh does amazing audio work himself anyway you could go to audible right now and get that book not only
[10:55] that but we are giving away uh free copies of that audible book if you can help us spread the word my goal is to try and find a way to get that audiobook uh uh out there because the only change you have with audio I'm
[11:10] really going on about the book aren't I but the only chance you have with the audiobook is right when it comes out that's it that's the only chance you have we're going to talk about conspiracy I swear just let me get through this please this is important it's my work too it's not even like I'm peddling Frozen stakes in the mail
[11:23] I'm I'm literally telling you I busted my ass writing this book and now put in the the effort and we pound it out uh it it on audio and now it's available and you can go there are three reviews
[11:36] already two are great one is like awful it's like so awful this guy you could tell that when he heard the book it made him very angry very very angry and he said you could tell this guy's hurt and it's it's like poetry
[11:51] and those two things would be yeah that's that part is pretty accurate but I you need to see how how the breaking happens how the fracture happens because
[12:04] of the psychic lessons in these 47 chapters these are not about me there might be one or two that abortion comes with some flowers that one's about me there's uh uh there's maybe there's some that are about me but most of the mcgorry
[12:20] Vanderbilt's in there the Satanic ritual of 911 is in there one of my most uh famous essays if I might say seriously that one got a lot of traction uh uh uh The Reptilian space Pope is in there
[12:35] um there's a lot in there the the the the Folly of Relativity uh we analyzed 357 star clusters that have been documented that the disproved redshift in relativity that that's in there that's
[12:49] not about pain I mean sure it hurt my feelings but I wasn't like oh my God special relativity broke my heart oh I'm gonna write some poetry but it was poetic because there's a guy and he's in front of a train and this train goes by
[13:03] and he feels the raw force of this train just shaking the Earth around him and it makes him wake up and these 47 short stories of what my control truly is or showing you the Mind Control at the top of the ladder all the
[13:17] way down to the bottom the lowliest one of us is just as susceptible to those at the top and the ones that are the most vulnerable are like that dude on Twitter this morning that says well I don't I don't think I'm actually very
[13:32] susceptible to mind control so clearly I'm not going to ingest this new literature that was my favorite that that would be its own chapter in and of itself so go to audible you do a search for James True you can look for those
[13:45] reviews if you go to my website jtr.com you'll see a link and click on there right now if you're on Twitter and you're retweeting that article that enters you into a contest Melanie's got some things cooking she might even have something to chat by now I don't know
[13:58] I'm gonna get on the show but if you if you dig my dig what's going on and you want to consider please consider that book please consider that book on Audible blueprints of Mind Control by James True read by Miguel Connor ISBN
[14:12] 74647211 okay stairwell stairway conspiracy is that the name of the chat hey 18 people in Rockford how's it going guys the staircase of conspiracy I wanted to talk about this but I want to translate it into into our
[14:32] time I want you to remember back when you believed everything you were told when every story you were inserted that was inserted in you with words by the way that you comprehended so you have no
[14:49] choice but to let them unravel that there was a time when you when you still believed everything you were told I would like to invite some of you to write in the chat and explain how you were so much more awake than anyone else
[15:05] and that that never happened to you please people are waiting operators are standing by to praise you with witness about how immune you are to mind control so let's get that out of the way
[15:17] okay now the rest of us that are that are beautiful humans just natural humans that have empathy that aren't Psychopaths that are will believe what we're told because we were brought up in a trusting relationship with someone
[15:32] where it became quite natural for us to believe what we were told it saved us calories that allowed us to eat you get it it's a very natural function to do these things that there was a time when you were on level one
[15:47] when you were at the very very very first steps of your journey and that Journey was not too high off the ground and then any chance you might take to
[16:01] take a step that was above would only be met with the shortest of fall a simple fall just down one step back to the floor again and that you you started to do this when you maybe started to question
[16:16] uh something easy it wasn't easy at the time but right now it was easy that maybe for the very first time you heard a report on CNN about let's say really really easy like Justin small it
[16:31] that that dude like the lynching dude guy remember him that that you saw something like Justin's small it and and because it was the very very first tiny step
[16:43] you took a step up to to view the world from One Step Above and you saw a new vista that you'd never seen before and that was the first Vista of doubt it
[16:57] was the first uh opportunity opportunity for you to catch a lie and certainly you've seen lies as a kid
[17:13] but because you were brought up in this trusting relationship this family unit that you needed to survive that fed you wiped your ass all that stuff you'd never seen a a large lie that that
[17:26] Predator had not been shown to you before and Justin Smolich showed it to you it's just a tiny little glimpse and that was a little Glimpse because all it really meant was CNN's full of [ __ ] which is not really that hard right I mean that's
[17:43] kind of easy but it's important and the people that are watching CNN when they take that step
[17:52] they are committing more bravery then you might be able to remember or imagine and that you might even uh degrade now
[18:06] or denigrate now because of where you are that you might look at that at and still uh not find the true torque and value in what's happening and that the only way
[18:21] that that you would ever have been able to ramp up is by having these successive levels of steps that you could climb up that Justin smolit um becomes hard because you know that
[18:35] the next day when you go back to work and your your liberal friends who you thought cared about everybody because they were always going on and on about how important sodomy month was or that they were virtue signaling about
[18:48] how they're saving a planet because they paid a surgeon to cut their balls off or that that vegan chick has decided that that what's best for her
[19:03] is to eat dirt now all of these things that we see in the environment are helping us they're helping us find that level and the trauma that someone else is going through is actually being secreted and
[19:18] turned into a kind of pollen that you and I are picking up and that pollen is wisdom that problem is gnosis through Folly that the Folly of their ways is alchemized and transmuted into gold
[19:31] purely in the furnace of our witness The Crucible of our Witness transmutes that rust into stainless steel and that that person who's making that
[19:46] Folly in your presence is giving you the deepest form of potlatch the deepest gift you could imagine and one of the reasons why it's so deep is because they don't even know they're giving it to you they're giving it to
[20:00] you so freely and so innocently that it's never something they would ever be able to feel credit for and if you were to explain it to them they would be more angry they wouldn't
[20:13] be complimented Potlatch itself is a secretion of humanity through anonymity that your secretion of love for Humanity when it's not for someone you know
[20:31] but it's for something that you're part of is a level of love and it's very similar to these levels these structures this staircase of conspiracy that the lowest Kind of Love is the recognition
[20:44] that Jesse Smollett is full of [ __ ] that that's the easiest kind of love and I know I've talked about this before so I I hope I'm not being too repetitive I'll go quick but the baby has love for its mother
[20:57] because it's it's paid to it's the easiest kind of love the baby is being nourished the baby equates nourishment with love that's easy and as that baby grows it develops a
[21:11] love for its brother the brother is not necessarily providing it with care it's providing it with something else but this something else is a mutual transaction it's not a one-way transaction it's AI scratch your back
[21:24] you scratch my back it's a mutual beneficial kind of love it's love that has a benefit also paid to it but it's mutual I am My Brother's Keeper what I do to my brother my brother does to me
[21:37] it's not the same you can pee in your mom's face as a baby and she's not going to hit you she's not going to beat you up if you do that to your brother he's gonna [ __ ] make you pay these are different levels see these are different
[21:52] levels of understanding the Jesse smallett is peeing in your daddy's face right and then building seven or nine eleven would be more like Brotherly Love It's A Step Above requires a little bit more
[22:07] uh from you requires a little bit more danger in fact for you to fall off the second step is going to hurt more than if you fall off the first step and if it wasn't for the first step that second step might not have even been
[22:21] possible that Jesse Smollett that people falling for Jesse smallett is alchemizing in everyone else's Mind through their Witness by noticing how stupid they are for believing this [ __ ] on CNN see how
[22:34] it works that that alchemizes in me even though I don't really know who Jesse smallit is I don't really know even what the story is about but I've heard the Echoes and the ripples come through that that that
[22:48] I I know it's the exact same pattern that's happened before that these patterns are effervescent in our society they're they're everywhere and they're not everywhere because
[23:00] um the world was wired by by Mere Men they're everywhere because the Resonance of this world makes it so that the fractal itself that defines our reality will always form
[23:15] these steps as you progress up the staircase of conspiracy conspiracy at the very heart
[23:27] is the power of doubt it is the very essence of my audiobook blueprints of Mind Control is that true people you'll see that they'll use that quote a lot they'll say is that true it's because on page one
[23:42] very powerful intro ends in that statement it explains the Ubermensch that rises inside of you the amount of torque it requires for you to even doubt
[23:58] that doubt is a special kind of torque a special kind of secretion that only comes from a very very tuned man and that that tune man can only express
[24:11] that doubt because they have an economy plasma at their disposal and that they choose to spend that Plasma on doubt that their calories that are burning in their brain the red blood
[24:24] cells on their suicide mission only only lasts for about nine months right that they are birthed in your marrow that the bones of your will are born and placed in the chamber of your heart and charged with the very will of what
[24:38] you want to do and you took those moments and you said I declare doubt in this world and you brought down the spirit of doubt and opened a [ __ ] Stargate into
[24:52] this portal and created a new Beast and this Beast was your familiar this familiar watched over your back and was constantly whispering in your ears have you zetetically experienced the
[25:06] truth of what this person is saying to you and this figure on your soldiers on your shoulder is going to be considered a demon
[25:20] that the very Greek definition of demon Damon is divine inspiration and that willpower itself excuse me that willpower itself is the demon of your ancestors the
[25:39] d-a-i-m-o-n this always running unconscious Spirit runs your digestion it runs all these things that are inside of you and that this spirit is who you are
[25:53] and you've been told it's a demon you've been told it's evil you've been told not to listen and that voice ignores it all it ignores it all and leans in because
[26:06] you gave it calories and said that story's [ __ ] this was a step on a very long painful staircase that has exceptional views
[26:25] that the vistas that you find from every one of those steps is so startling so spectacular that it will literally shake you to the core it will change you that there is a shaking happening around your whole core
[26:39] and what's happening from that shake is the oscillations are shaking free loose mud and debris encased petrified reptile [ __ ] that's been covering your
[26:53] skin like scales and that the Attunement of that doubt is a piercing heat that's inside of you and it's causing this vibration to happen and you
[27:07] want to see more that this demon turns you into a creature where you want more divine inspiration the actual definition of demon in Greek
[27:24] and that your doubt becomes a liquid plasma being that's there to serve you and it's there to show you things that you never thought possible and the
[27:39] things that it will show you will make you feel evil that when you start to doubt the very first thing that happens around the water cooler is people start to back away from you
[27:56] that here you are doubting the Jesse Smollett story which means you must be a racist and that they are seeing the demon in you they are seeing the divine inspiration of who you are your intuition hey Melanie let me know if
[28:10] people are freaking the [ __ ] out because I'm using the word demon in chat I'm not gonna say I'm gonna change but just let me know uh this experience that you have now
[28:23] with your intuition on your shoulder scares the piss out of people it scares the piss out of Puritans now Puritan is not someone who's pure a Puritan is someone who feels pure based on the
[28:37] ratings of those around him that Puritan itself is the measure of what Thy Neighbor considers pure about you and that that is a turning inside out
[28:52] that you've turned yourself inside out of this point because you were looking to the world to Define for you what is good what is proper and we've masked this idea in something called the greater good
[29:08] and the greater good is the most elegant beautiful prom date you could ever have she's dressed in the finest chiffon and that Chrysler Liberian convertible
[29:22] that you drove up on Cameron Hill has all the stars out at night but it's not true and this demon that you have in the trunk is telling you she already gave her virginity to
[29:42] someone she was lying okay that was like very personal story but these Journeys that we make are never easy and when you start to look at what makes
[29:55] them uneasy you understand why people demonize anyone who doubts that it becomes easier to doubt anyone who doubts
[30:07] than it does to take that step up that those at the water cooler who still believe in Jesse smallett are manifesting their defenses by saying well you must be a racist if you doubt that story of Jesse Smollett and that what they're literally doing is

[30:36] next step and you don't like it there it's what are you doing you had brethrenship with them you had kinship with them you had fellowship with them
[30:48] everything was great and now you're the outsider who's suffering a demonic possession of the intuition and that he is doubting the very core
[31:02] the very fiber of our puritanical Society of truth that we are raised in the religion that the voice outside you can never be wrong and that we are raised under the
[31:16] deaconship of regurgitation is education an indoctrination is purification purification means you're okay
[31:31] so there is a Prophet at the bottom that at the bottom lies a universal feeling of moral good and of selfless
[31:47] acceptance and love that no matter who you are we accept you and love you that the very least that could possibly be required of you is not even required
[32:02] and that if you remain on the floor on the checkerboard on the black and white squares of this Hall that you will find the most self-love and the most Comfort there and that there is no danger of falling from a step because there's nowhere left
[32:18] to fall that you've reached the bottom of the pit and that the hollow deck is there provide you with a space to survive stepping up
[32:34] through these structures cannot be easy because if it was easy everybody would do it and if everybody would do it you would no longer have a hermetical path to gnosis
[32:56] you would have a paved uh walkway the elevated pathway right come experience nature on our elevated Boardwalk so you don't actually have to
[33:13] touch the nature but you're in it these people are not cowards no more than you are a coward even these people are making transactions
[33:35] for their own Survival and we forget how far we've came and the only way you can remember is to look at how far you came is to notice What it Took
[33:47] to get you up that next step and the only reason why you decided to leave the black and white checkerboard of the floor is because you couldn't handle it it was
[34:00] too painful to pretend that [ __ ] was real that's what I mean and that's a good thing but at the end of the day you're Prana suffered that your economy suffered that you had a deficit
[34:14] that you were living in a deficit there because you were going back to the water cool every day and it was draining you while everyone else was being fed from it that the well that you thought would never run dry had run dry and you can say that you reach for the
[34:30] higher level because of how magnanimous you were or how Noble you were or how much smarter you were but no you actually retched for the next level because it was too uncomfortable to stay where you were and this is a more honest approach to
[34:45] what man really is that we are creatures of comfort and thank God we are thank you God because if we were not creatures of comfort none of us would be able to compassionate each other that none of us
[35:02] would be able to understand each other because we would all be wired in different ways but we're not we value comfort the very meaning of what we you and me right now in this theistic world because
[35:15] we don't have we don't all adopt animism right now yet have this definition that life itself is simply that which expresses comfort that you know something's dead because you poke it with a stick and you know if
[35:29] you poke it with a stick that thing will say hey that's uncomfortable and it will show you it's alive it will express its discomfort for you why because it is a comfort seeking entity and it seeks Comfort because Comfort is
[35:43] survival and you should seek Comfort too and you've been brought up in this puritanical Society where you're not supposed to seek comfort and thank goodness because maybe it will make you look at the puritanical society and say this is full of [ __ ]
[35:56] that selflessness looks exactly the same on paper as evacuation those two things are exactly the same and the greater good is really waiting for the number of villagers that come
[36:09] through with torches and deciding that they know what's best for me that's what the greater good literally means but you only know that after you've evacuated yourself and gone all
[36:22] the way over to that step and seeing its Vista and the failure that you made by making such a poor decision just as I have is liquid gnosis to anyone who witnesses it
[36:37] but we hide our gold from other people we hide our failures because we don't want them to see them which means we deny access to all that alchemy that transmutation and that you would feed your neighbors
[36:51] simply by doubting in front of his presence and letting him witness whether or not you doubted correctly or let him witness how expensive it will be to continue doubting
[37:03] that even that teaches him where he's at it shows him I'm never going up on that next step and he creates that witness Canon for anyone else to see
[37:19] you see this now q and I you see this now and any belief system we have the war with China the Chinese virus is even the same thing we have this Notions that come with
[37:33] these sub subservient Notions and those serbs of your Notions are really what we're after that it's those sub beliefs that we really want and we can't bring them directly out of the light because that would cause these
[37:46] demon doubts to come down and eviscerate all this harmony and so people react to this the ignorance that you see in this world is not a sin
[38:02] the ignorance that you see in this world is pure Virgin Snow that the first step is ignorance the very very first step is one
[38:20] dimensions dimensions is the concept that there even is something to doubt that's level one and on level one your main power is going to be ignorance
[38:35] amnesia and that these are not flaws in you these are gifts from God that Amnesia was a gift given to you because if you were born with the memories of everything that you've had of every epigenetic thing that's
[38:49] happened even though you are but if they're brought to your memory and rendered in your eyes you would start out having a very very bad time that you need that innocence because you're making a chronic equation a thermodynamic
[39:02] equation with the world over what you're willing to accept and render in your eyes is true and what you're not and CNN is that level one it's so ridiculous that it makes the step
[39:17] obvious and simple but has such a threshold of comfort to it that it stops those who are not ready from accidentally stepping up this is the true power of a Rapture that this
[39:32] Rapture that we're watching now is seriously a giant game of Tetris that we are being moved and placed in such a way to where there's no way this could be an
[39:47] accident the staircase of conspiracy the very first step is white it is the same rules that we have with our belts in Dojo when we talk about psychology and the movement of your energy
[40:09] that you Embrace ignorance as a shield to just stop the burning searing truth of reality from burning your eyes out you're four you don't need to know
[40:23] that all banking is based on fraud you don't need to know that the only way a currency could ever succeed is if it had fraud underneath it it's just true you don't need to know that because so many people in the world don't have
[40:39] the ability to produce their own employment that we have to have industries that are completely built on top of propaganda and [ __ ] that that culture itself is a bunch of ants clinging to each
[40:53] other's back and they think they're crossing a stream but they're not there's no sides it's just water and the only way they can stay up is by lying to each other about how this is
[41:07] land no I'm just stepping on a bunch of guys but underneath them it's totally land and that this constant movement is the only way that it would survive in a rainstorm it's the only way it would happen is by
[41:20] creating that bubble of ignorance and simply going with it that if everybody was to scatter everyone would be lost and that itself shows you the truth of what greater good is greater good is a reality bubble that has power
[41:34] and the reality bubble that comes in and shapes you the most is going to Define what it is and you can see this or you can't and that decision will not be based on how intelligent you are quite the
[41:48] opposite it'll be based on how indoctrinated you are and how much you feel that you've invested into the system being real that's ultimately the litmus test is the ones that take the step did not invest nearly as much as the [ __ ]
[42:02] who went to Cornell got two hundred thousand dollars in debt you think he can afford to doubt this system at that point how is that possible where do you even begin there are zero Absolution from student loans
[42:19] let that witness alchemize you and let his Potlatch be revealed that what he's committing is not stupidity he's committing sacrifice for human growth The Next Step Up from White is a yellow
[42:34] step it's the step of fear and you see this everywhere the second you enter the truth movement you start freaking the [ __ ] out and you read these stories like in blueprints of Mind Control now available in audible book read by Miguel Connor and you start to read these stories
[42:50] about the elites about the Vanderbilts about the Rockefellers about all these things and it scares the piss out of you because you're starting to see the world for what it really is and you're starting to understand why white was so effective why down on that first step so much
[43:05] better because it was just like Justin smolin [ __ ] that was it it wasn't like we were manufacturing Global Wars and literally committing homicide
[43:18] all to support lies about a Petra dollar that's based on the idea a myth of an energy crisis when all that oil all of it seven trillion barrels of oil
[43:31] is just sitting there natural crude and that our taxes are paying to keep it from us that step is a hard step in that step if you if you only have so much energy to take that because you're
[43:45] new to staircases and that staircases themselves are hard for you that that second step is a big [ __ ] deal but no a few years old step 10 you're gonna look like look at that idiot on step two look how slow he is he's not slow at all he's creating he's forming a miracle
[44:00] that dude's performing a miracle right in front of your eyes that you're seeing the very first steps of a child that sees past the First Dimension it starts to see the Power of Two
[44:18] the power of Hegel the power of a dialectic itself is not inherently evil that the idea of heading towards one way and seeing the Folly and then heading towards another way and seeing the Folly doesn't have to be a trap for cattle that if you're rational
[44:33] and you have enough calories you will simply see wow look how easy that works this is a divining rod and they and that the hegelian dialectic is not guiding people that the dividing Rod is showing you
[44:47] where the people's current will go and you don't pick those dowsing rods and wherever you walk on the land water suddenly magically appears because you helped held dousing rods doesn't work that way the dowsing Rod show you
[45:01] where the natural current flows and the natural current flows naturally wasn't written by a bunch of hermetic dudes who wore aprons lambscam aprons but that this [ __ ] is built into the
[45:14] fabric of reality that your understanding will go through a white phase of ignorance and if you save up enough calories and if you spend your energy wisely if you don't throw it away on puritanical demon
[45:28] hunting if you don't burn all your calories on Justin small at stories that you could spend those calories on something more and you ask what and the answer is feared you're like [ __ ] that I don't want to spit it on fear which is why so
[45:42] many sheep remain where they are and this is a good thing because we only want the people to make it to the yellow step who want to be there we want consent we don't want
[45:57] people on level two who are terrified and feel like they were forced into this that is not how you awaken a flower you flower tells you it wants to get up
[46:12] that's the only way it works so you need these systems in place to allow you to rise and if you spend your fear wisely and discernedly it's very easy to do you
[46:25] start to notice that Leviathan has certain characteristics and these these characteristics allow you to actually know exactly you could passionate your enemy on the mat because you understand how he feeds
[46:39] and you know that the Leviathan is not vengeful no he's not stop saying that it's much colder than that the Leviathan is cold and methodical not vengeful that's what makes it so sick if the Leviathan was vengeful we'd enjoy
[46:54] this more but it's not it's not it's a machine machine doesn't wriggle its fingers together and go I'm going to commit evil
[47:07] now it doesn't happen that way the absence it's an absence of compassion kill someone because you think their evil is the most compassion you can feel
[47:20] you are full of passion for that act if you spend your fear wisely on level two that second step Dimension two if you play your prawn economy right
[47:37] you notice that you have more energy than just fear then you have an abundance that you are now a hundred thousand heir
[47:48] that you have achieved a level where fear is not necessarily what you're in the market for anymore and that next step is read your fear is now anger
[48:03] that you have an anger in place now at this system and that you're transmuting the fear into anger and that that fear rose out of your ignorance you're seeing a white to
[48:17] Yellow to Red movement a transmutation up a staircase of sorts of a spine of sorts taking you somewhere higher and that anger
[48:29] which society condemns more than fear that we we show more comfort for those who fear things but if someone's angry at the system that's completely intolerable that that anger itself has its own
[48:42] initiation that if you were to enter yourself into that Realm that not only do you lose the Justin small it's at the cooler but you actually lose your job entirely
[48:58] that you just simply cannot fit in in that atmosphere that you need something that's more physical it's more Outdoors that you find yourself not even capable of standing on that step
[49:11] and you need to go higher and you need to look at this third level which is the triangle the third dimension all of that power is there the fire triangle three fuels right
[49:27] fuel heat oxygen anger what is that fuel of your ignorance the heat of your you know the oxygen of your ignorance making this up as I go
[49:44] and the fuel of your anger that those three things create something that wasn't there before they form a triangle and every single illusion that's broadcasted to you on the screen
[49:59] looks like a triangle that every 3D rendering engine that runs its game that every single illusion that you've ever seen only requires a triangle only requires three points in space
[50:13] with the transmutation between and that even anger doesn't cut the mustard that even on this level of anger there's more and I think most of us on the truth
[50:31] movement who come into the conspiracy staircase will remain on level one and will remain fearful and they will do that because it feels good when I do that because they're tricked
[50:45] they will not do that because a secret outside force fooled them and that they were innocent no that they will make a sovereign powerful decision to remain in that yellow belt because it's too uncomfortable to go to Red
[50:58] that anger's been shamed too much because anger is action that when you're angry you have no choice but to act that that torque is so strong
[51:11] that you you were forced into expelling that way somehow someway each of these steps is more prone to accusation and each of these steps
[51:27] send you down a place of solitude that you enter into an initiation with yourself and that that intuition that that demon that demon that divine
[51:42] inspiration is the only thing that's with you the entire time so you start to use your senses you have all this anger you have all this energy you apply it where where it goes
[52:00] you start to listen more you start to see more you start to feel more you start to smell more you start to taste more you start to understand the true nature of right reality The Columns the structures that it's built on the Tuscan columns the Dork the ionic
[52:14] the Corinthian the composite that we build things on things that are fake as much as we build things on things that are tradition and there's an entire Spectrum in between but none of them are the top
[52:29] that none of them are even reality they're simply the same structure as the pyramid that if you have enough energy to go past your anger you start to build things you start to build something
[52:43] called compassion which is green and this is the hardest for people to learn because you think automatically if you have compassion you're consenting to what they do that James thinks that no one's evil
[52:58] he has compassion for everyone and that's just [ __ ] it's a great it's a great argument it's a very yellow step argument to make because you made an assumption about me saying there's no evil and an assumption
[53:13] about the compassion and it's cool I think that that's actually a natural I'm doing the same thing I'm creating a step to see who has the capability of comprehending this more and who doesn't
[53:25] because I can't go on explaining if we have all these yellow belts here it's not going to work and when the yellow belts start here and if you can hear me just hang on dang it oh [ __ ]
[53:59] ah [ __ ] I think maybe does this other camera work razor razor how's that [Music] I think that if this if sorry
[54:16] you think that if this yellow belt works [Music] you think that if this yellow belt I can't remember what it's talking about when we get to that third step [Music] let me get to that third step right there
[54:37] we start and quit this [Music] please just just let me keep going here buddy please just stop stop quitting on me do you think when we reach this third
[54:56] step that that's it and it's not the four steps the hardest step because the fourth step you start to have to learn self enunciation
[55:10] for the very very first time you've had the crutch this entire way of there being evil outside of you which has allowed you to not have to stare at what's inside that you've been freed from that from
[55:24] that entire experiment because it's allowed you to save calories and you have things like luciferians or Freemasons or the Liberals are the globalists are the Republicans
[55:39] you have all these groups that you get to say are the evil ones and you're the good one and that that place when you're caramelized in that anger is is where most of the yellow belts listen to red
[55:53] belts right now because they're feeding them that that information that gnosis that ability to stay the entertainment on the yellow the entertainment on the yellow deck today will be
[56:05] luciferians why they're the cause of everything that's happened and that they are trying these people whether they know it or not they're using their resonance to try and promote you into red belt thought because that's your next step
[56:19] and that's good that we would be doing better if more of us were anger we're angry and less of us were afraid it would be more successful and I don't know a lot of people that are on the green step
[56:36] I don't know a lot of people that say what I say because of how [ __ ] expensive it is that the moment you start telling people evil is not what you think it is they think that means evil isn't real and I'm telling you that this notion
[56:49] that you have about what you think is evil is not real because your misunderstanding the thermodynamic equation that we have painted in us this idea that there are evil people that work out at the gym
[57:06] that they're so evil they go to the gym three times a week and they get enemas and they have a tailor and they're American Psycho and they're super rich and they they just [ __ ] all night and say God I'm evil look how evil I am and
[57:19] some chicks like you're so evil you're so evil and that's the most [ __ ] thing I've ever heard next to all the [ __ ] that I heard down there on white it's [ __ ]
[57:34] and you're wasting all that precious Red Energy when you could be compassionating but you're not going to be able to compassionate if you think for a minute that it means we're up here forgiving people are you kidding [ __ ] green level is all about ownership
[57:48] all you're going to do is Zone stuff up here that's it that's the only choice you have is to own it why because you understand that the reality itself is based on pillars that could be fake or real
[58:03] that the columns that form this society that form my very senses themselves are in fact compassionated through my amygdala and that the very truth of what they are itself is not
[58:18] the deeper reality that's inside me and I'm not telling you to deny your senses I'm telling you to immerse even further and do the math and you will start to notice why different people render different realities because it's the only thing
[58:33] they can afford and when you have that much compassion something amazing happens in you it doesn't make you forgive anybody it makes you start to see where you've limited yourself in the same way and the
[58:47] moment you tap into how you're limiting yourself you start to hunt not luciferians not Freemasons but victimhood you start to hunt how convenient and
[59:00] profitable it is to [ __ ] out to wuss out to be afraid or to be angry is to [ __ ] out when you're on the green step when you're on the yellow step to be angry is progress good for you I'm calling that
[59:15] morality you just secreted morality my friend way to go if you're a white belt and you decide to get afraid congratulations you've just secreted morality you've just done something powerful you secreted that witness so
[59:28] someone else could see that and now they are better for it but if you're listening to this idea of an objective higher good outside of your self-morality moral code you are listening to the [ __ ] machine and the only way you're going to feel
[59:45] good is by judging every single other person that doesn't agree with you and I don't care if you want to spend all your time judging I don't care because judging is good we need to judge the world more but you can't pretend like you're saving the world while you're wasting this much

59:59] electricity because demonizing someone else like that is wasting electricity you can take your opponent down by compassionating him Mike Tyson had more compassion for
[01:00:11] his opponent than anyone else in that Hall Mike Tyson was witnessing that jaw that jaw
[01:00:23] was Mike Tyson's deepest passion and he tracked that jaw like you would track the most beautiful woman in the room he found compassion for that jaw by
[01:00:36] understanding how much it would [ __ ] hurt if he destroyed it compassion is not what you think it is
[01:00:50] compassion is a seven dimensional sonar that transmutes time and space itself where you plasmatically create and simulate a living [ __ ] human in your Holodeck excuse my language Alora I
[01:01:05] know you got a kid in the room you compassionate your enemy and you build him with such profound precise accuracy that you now can read the future because you know exactly what
[01:01:17] your opponent is going to do and that that kind of foresight does not come from wasting your electricity it comes from Focus and it's funny because the jungle itself
[01:01:32] teaches focus it teaches Focus so much that a bunch of lazy ass yahoos decided let's build fence let's call it a fort let's pretend that Predator is not
[01:01:47] inside and there's where all your energy goes and you're not compassionating the Jaguar you're not compassionating the panther you're not compassionating the snake you're pretending
[01:02:03] that you're a Puritan and everyone around you is civilized and so these staircase that you see is a life preserver that the essence of this entire Journey
[01:02:19] was laid down like a helicopter from a coast guard rescuing you from a pulling ship and that these things that you see in the world are helping you and that building seven was a Christmas
[01:02:34] present a Christmas present that they gave you that building for free because that just like you express your love for your mom or your dad by peeing in his face just like you express your
[01:02:48] love for your brother that you express your love for Humanity by showing them things they don't want to see you can call that wrong you can call it
[01:03:01] evil it doesn't matter because it's still nature and that everything you do is natural and everything they do is natural too and none of us can be that arrogant to claim that we are the only thing in
[01:03:16] nature that's capable of Breaking Free of Nature and actually behaving in a way that's unnatured that's arrogant psychopathy to even suggest that these things that we're doing here
[01:03:32] all the vitriol all the pain that you see in the world is constructed and I know that because it's all consent driven right now all of it that a very special mitosis has been built a very special stair structure has
[01:03:46] been laid in place to where no one no one taller than this line gets to ride this ride that you do not get to go up on level two unless you can afford a ticket to be
[01:03:59] afraid and you do not get to rise to level three unless you have the money to feel anger reality itself is tuned
[01:04:21] just like you are Humanity itself has built into it built in it wasn't made by Masons this is built into reality all this vitriol
[01:04:36] is an initiation program and you can take it or leave it but once you see that the world you create itself is not something you could rely on you start to raise again but you start to look at grammar and rhetoric
[01:04:50] and logic and geometry and music and astronomy as Creationary tools not explanatory tools guys the reason why astronomy is at the
[01:05:03] top of the list is the same reason why no civilian is allowed above 50 000 feet that the Hermetic secret society is broken down
[01:05:17] by threshold inside threshold inside threshold and that's how you build a circuit of Mystery and that evil itself Satan itself could be
[01:05:30] a curtain nothing else a curtain with the person outside that curtain telling you Satan's inside and and that person telling you you can protect this world if you stand outside my curtain until then that Satan's
[01:05:47] inside here that same process keeps happening over and over again and it's an Amway scheme it's a giant Amway scheme to surrender and it's a healthy surrender it's
[01:06:05] necessary because some of us can't hack it these are staircases you get high up these can get hurt and the more lies you find the more current you have to draw because you just like you compassionate your
[01:06:19] opponent you have to compassionate your own reality that you have to get up and remind yourself of what reality really is and Forge it from your own bubble and that's why there's Republicans and Democrats that's why there's this
[01:06:32] two-party system it's because there are people out there that cannot render their own video game that they need someone else to render the triangles for them because it's just too much work it's too much work
[01:06:46] they'd like to get better but this is the tutorial they're not cheap they're new are slow but you're slow too and this isn't even
[01:06:58] a race because once you get to the top I don't necessarily think you ever do that as we start to unlock this eye of raw stuff if you start to understand what the amygdala is really doing if you start to understand how reality itself
[01:07:13] is going to be shown to you based on how comfortable you are or how uncomfortable you are with what's inside it and that that is the biggest definition of reality it's not media it's you
[01:07:28] that you define reality so much more than media ever could that you have a much more powerful paintbrush than that and you'll paint me as as someone who who's out of touch because I think evil doesn't exist
[01:07:44] and that's the only choice you would have right now to leave this step and say [ __ ] this place man this guy's talking about how composite columns make up reality and how and how we can make up our own [ __ ] and there's no way that's true and it's because you've
[01:07:56] never once considered that 375 star clusters that disprove the entire red blue shift inside blueprints of mind control and audiobook showing you something you don't want to see
[01:08:10] that thousands name millions of people will methodically believe something because they're told why because they never ever had the calories to ask is that true
[01:08:28] and that's not a flaw it's a thermodynamic equation we judge those in the grocery store who buy Pop-Tarts instead of red peppers but if you were in their cockpit you'd buy Pop-Tarts too
[01:08:48] you have two dollars and 58 cents in your account and you can buy a box of Pop-Tarts and that is six Pop-Tarts three separate sealed bags that cannot
[01:09:02] be eaten by the roaches at home that can be hidden safely in your locker at work and no one would steal them that that is something that you can have but not red pepper and if you were to buy the red pepper and play this [ __ ] game that there's
[01:09:17] only one morality that you would have a red pepper that would [ __ ] go bad and if you tried to eat it you'd have gas all day because you didn't cook it and not once did it bring you any pleasure or nourishment at all and you wouldn't be better for it you wouldn't be healthier the next day all you'd be
[01:09:32] is you'd be able to walk into the break room and have some other [ __ ] bag tell you well you're maybe not as immoral as I thought you were going to be because you bought a red pepper now you buy Pop-Tarts because it's what you could afford you buy fear because it's what you can afford you buy anger
[01:09:47] because that's what you could afford you buy compassion because I've been saving the [ __ ] money yo I put it in crypto or I decided this or I invested in this or I quit buying this or I quit going on
[01:10:00] a weekends now I'm ready and you can afford the pan it takes to even cook that red pepper you can afford the place it takes to store that equipment to have that
[01:10:13] electricity on neither one of those is moral in fact the person who's at the bottom who's buying Pop-Tarts is secreting more morality than you
[01:10:26] if you're living the good life and all you do is buy a green pepper or a red pepper now the amount of Leverage it took for them to even feel
[01:10:38] the need to sustain themselves is the most essential form of self-love we have that's why survival is so important because at the very base root of its survivalist self-preservation and
[01:10:51] self-preservation is the vibration of self-love and so at the heart of it all no matter how hard it gets those who want to survive are demonstrating their desire for self-preservation which is a
[01:11:07] demonstration of self-love which means that the world is constantly secreting from them proof for their own eyes that they are loved if they're loved so much that they're going to go in and be judged and buy
[01:11:19] some Pop-Tarts with an EBT card because that's how much they want to survive the heroes of Consciousness are not Alex Gray the dude who's painting the beautiful paintings with all the Consciousness [ __ ] that dude wears a
[01:11:34] mask every day on Instagram no the conscious Warriors are not [ __ ] due in Ayahuasca nothing wrong with Ayahuasca do Ayahuasca but the conscious Warriors are in the [ __ ] cities they're in third world cities
[01:11:47] during gangs they're living on the edge of Somalia and that their Consciousness is so much more powerful than yours that they can hold a
[01:12:02] reality bubble in the middle of the worst suck and worst [ __ ] you could ever imagine got it backwards and no one has to climb this staircase that's what makes it so honorable
[01:12:17] that's what makes it so important that we are sharpened like the stone and that the staircases are our initiation I'm not a Freemason I've never been to a Freemason meeting I've never been to a
[01:12:34] lodge I've probably I probably like walked into a lodge once because it was like a tour or something I've never been invited to a Mason meeting I was in a fraternity in college but that lasted six months I was thrown out
[01:12:47] because of religious differences I'm not a Freemason I'm telling you that there are archetypal crevices built into the architecture of this world the
[01:13:02] terrain map has seams and that those scenes have steps and those steps you can climb or not or not
[01:13:15] and if you think this whole idea of climbing steps is is awful just blame the Freemasons for everything but we are sharpened like Stone and no matter where you go in the world
[01:13:29] these stones are sharpening us no matter how you look at it they are this is the nature of reality you are looking at predator and you can blame me but it's only because you see me compassionating it and you think that
[01:13:44] that means I'm consenting and I'm telling you how to survive the only way to survive is to compassionate your opponent on the mat look underneath the Veil
[01:13:59] see what they're trying to do understand that BlackRock and black stone group and black Cube that all of these injuries at all of these industries promoting
[01:14:21] environmentalism defending Harvey Weinstein the largest Capital asset owner in the world blacks Rock and then Black Stone the largest liquidation company in the world and
[01:14:35] then Black Cube the largest intelligence company in the world that whether you want to admit it or not and whether you like them or not it doesn't matter because the system itself is sharpening your stone
[01:14:53] the very principles of Freemasonry lies cut lies cut over and over and over again until all that's left
[01:15:08] is the perfect Stone you can call that process luciferian you can call that process evil you can call self-betterment evil you can call people running the world and trying to better it evil and and I'm okay with that why because they are [ __ ] with you
[01:15:26] and anyone who's [ __ ] with you you get to call evil but I want you to know that it's no different than being a chickadee hanging out in front of a bird feeder and complaining because all these birds keep [ __ ] with him they're not [ __ ] with him
[01:15:42] he's standing right there where all the food is that's it he can move if he wants but man is just as much as succulent as he is a human being that we like to dig in
[01:15:58] so I'm not saying forgive him I don't think that any group will ever hold morality I think it's wrong to think that we dismiss our own morality by suggesting a group can even possess morality a group is a corpse it's a corporation
[01:16:12] it's a dead thing dead things don't secrete morality even a dead thing that sponsors a sodomy month is not is not moral you're not secreting morality by having a programmer spending money
[01:16:25] that's not morality morality is a very very special thing and it's only going to exist under the principles of potlatch that the truest form of reality is going to be secreted for you
[01:16:40] anonymously which means you're not going to know it which means it's going to be you showing your ass in public you having that toilet paper strand attached to your feet you showing your butt crack to your mom while you're fixing her Plumbing
[01:16:56] that's morality because they're seeing their Humanity inside you and they feel that their Humanity must be okay too now some of you need evil
[01:17:18] and I know that I'm making that expensive for you but that's what's on this level that all of your energy will come from you no longer exercising it into this demon
[01:17:32] that you think is the cause of all your problems and that if you really want to look at what a hermetical system is is it's that these steps let me see if I can go back
[01:17:49] that the steps that you're waiting on are the Trivium and the quadrivium the the pure instruments of rhetoric itself will get you where you need to go
[01:18:06] and it will never be an objective external myth of morality Mark Passyunk I have a lot of respect for he's I think his episode of morality is is out and I
[01:18:21] encourage you to let it sharpen your stone I encourage you to look at that and consider some of the things I've said and you'll understand that you're just looking at a puritanical puritan-esque
[01:18:34] morality versus a humanitarian morality a utilitarianism pragmatism morality which is what actually works the Masonic steps are there to work
[01:18:48] that's why the yellow step isn't wrong that's why the red step isn't Wrong by the way those aren't Masonic terms those are my terms but using anger is not wrong using fear is not wrong using ignorance is not wrong
[01:19:03] that these are thermodynamic equations that you're watching your fellow man make and they could be some of the most moral decisions you've seen once you understand their history once you understand how far that person had to come
[01:19:17] to even be mad the courage it took for them to even am alchemize that much anger truly heroic now Masonic system
[01:19:33] don't know [ __ ] about it don't all I know is is that these steps that I'm defining to you are built in to the fundamentals of this life
[01:19:46] and they're unvoidable I don't see a way around them and so to me it's super seeds excuse me it supersedes the Masons it's it was either there before them I don't know
[01:20:01] if you're asking well why are they [ __ ] with this James why are they [ __ ] with us I think we underestimate how [ __ ] up we are as a collective that when you're watching a bunch of people play those different levels from
[01:20:13] ignorance to fear to anger to even compassion and there's more steps Beyond compassion by the way but you have to come to dojo for that but the uh the if if we didn't have these Masonic
[01:20:26] systems in place like even like NASA that the amount of [ __ ] would be 11 times more and if you don't believe me I want you to look at circumcision
[01:20:41] I want you to look at how long that stayed is something that we did and how we insisted that it was for sanitation or for penis cancer or for whatever the [ __ ] else and I want you to look at our propensity to find demons in each other to burn
[01:20:55] herbalists to to do whatever it takes that we will run ourselves ragged and create a retribution economy very easily
[01:21:09] where your epigenetic ancestors are just locked in Revenge for Generation after generation because of the [ __ ] Hatfields and what they did and that when Masons introduce a prime enemy into the world that instantly it
[01:21:26] changes the focus of everyone around that the Hatfields aren't so bad because they're not the Freemasons and that you would notice right away that if you wanted to somehow establish
[01:21:39] order into this conglomerate that you would need a central figure to mount as your demon and that every now and then every month if you ran that demon through the
[01:21:54] streets all the Torches from all the villagers would act as a cleansing agent for everyone there that all the villagers would no longer would have a jubilee it would be a jubilee of energy for their neighbor
[01:22:06] because the hot and tots are in town and this is why the witchfinder general was so popular this is why the very person in America responsible for varilating over 400
[01:22:20] people 40 of them died insisted that vaccinations itself were a religious decision not a medical one that it was God that told him
[01:22:34] to do this it wasn't science and that the pus and boils that he pulled from the horse had the same effect as if they were pulled from a donkey at the same effect as if they're pulled from a cow
[01:22:47] why because it had nothing to do with vaccines it had everything to do with a man injecting assaulting another person's
[01:23:02] body with herpes starving them throwing them into a barn for six weeks with no food while with a bunch of other kids seeing which ones lived that that itself would
[01:23:14] elicit an immune response and the second someone did that to you your entire system would be on Red Alert going what the [ __ ] getting ready to happen and all of your white blood cells are your T cells all your B cells would
[01:23:28] be ready and looking for war but the puritanical desire we have overrode the rational reasoning that I just gave you that
[01:23:44] we're not able to rationally reason that that's actually what happened because we also have this other need to feel cleansed the way we can feel cleansed is to
[01:23:55] demonize this virus this invisible theme all of these things are prawn economies even what you say about the Masons and keep doing it because I'm not here to stop victimhood
[01:24:11] I am here to show victimhood I think victimhood's a good thing I think it's it shows that we have compassion for ourselves and that's very important because the moment we stop unleashing victimhood ourselves that's
[01:24:25] you literally trying to save your reputation and do less work at the same time that you are trying to honorably maintain yourself you're trying to preserve yourself so victimhood itself is not bad
[01:24:39] losing your energy without knowing it is just a waste of electricity and I value your electricity and if you valued your electricity even more you would have more electricity to spend you would be more
[01:24:53] compassionate you would be kinder the world would have more generosity because it would flow from your pollen that's the only reason why this isn't to
[01:25:07] make you feel bad because there's victimhood quite the opposite that should give you all the proof you need to know we're going to make it this is the best apocalypse ever
[01:25:21] the Aztecs say this is the sixth Sun sorry it runs so late you guys still watching say these this is the sixth son and that this incarnation that we just started
[01:25:36] that every time the world's destroyed quetzalcoat or does something special the Quetzalcoatl takes our bones and mixes them with corn so that when the next sun is given to us
[01:25:49] the Aztecs say that each of these worlds is given a son that that sun will react to the corn and that the memories will be there and that you will epigenetically remember compassionate the last apocalypse
[01:26:04] and right now we're seeing all these people fall to covet but a long time ago it was pull our heart out in a ceremony because the corona is here and none of us know what to do that we're getting better at this not worse
[01:26:18] and that every single apocalypse we have people who were in The know who epigenetically inherit this knowledge why because their epigenetic ancestors did really [ __ ] well and they were allowed to they had so much energy that they were allowed to
[01:26:31] store a time capsule that would survive complete reset it was an inheritance wisdom is and the Freemasons probably inherited some knowledge
[01:26:45] and why they inherit it because they spent so much work sharpening their Stone so good or bad doesn't matter they have energy and energy is the biggest teacher in
[01:27:00] nature shows you everything I'm gonna stop now thanks for being here if you want to buy my book it would really be awesome right now uh the audiobook it's on Audible I check links for descriptions there um
[01:27:14] love it if you consider it if you uh yeah if you like the book maybe leave a comment if you don't leave a comment too I I actually like how my books always have a very strong reaction it's always I really hate this
[01:27:28] book more than life itself and I really love this book it's it's it's the mitosis we talked about it's all knowing it's all showing I'm going to show you guys the planets uh

**ChatGPT:**
<h2>Chapter 1. Introduction</h2><h3>1.1. Introducing the Stairway of Conspiracy</h3><p>In the labyrinth of societal dynamics, where truth often hides behind veils of perception, the concept of the "stairway of conspiracy" emerges as a guiding light, illuminating the path toward understanding.</p><h4>Understanding the Framework</h4><p>The "stairway of conspiracy" isn't merely a theoretical construct but a pragmatic framework essential for dissecting the layers of societal complexities. It posits that beneath the surface of apparent events lies a network of interconnected forces shaping our reality. By acknowledging this framework, we transcend simplistic explanations and delve into the depths of societal mechanics.</p><h4>Blame and Personal Ideals</h4><p>One of the fundamental aspects addressed by this framework is the human tendency to externalize evil while internalizing goodness. It's easy to attribute societal issues to external forces, absolving oneself of responsibility.
