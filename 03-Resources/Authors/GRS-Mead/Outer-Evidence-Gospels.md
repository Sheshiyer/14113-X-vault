## 📝 Executive Summary
In this essay, **G.R.S. Mead** examines the external historical evidence (statements and quotations from early writers) regarding the authorship and authority of the four Canonical Gospels. He concludes that there is **no decisive evidence** for the existence or acceptance of the four Gospels as we know them before **150 A.D.**, and that traditional attributions of authorship are highly questionable.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Silence of Early Documents
*   **Pauline Epistles & Early Fathers:** Mead notes that Paul, Clement of Rome, Barnabas, and the *Didache* do not mention written Gospels. They rely on oral tradition or "Sayings" (Logia) that differ from the Canonical texts.

### 2. Papias (c. 115-140 A.D.)
*   **The Logia:** Papias refers to a "Mark" who wrote down Peter's words (but "not in order") and a "Matthew" who collected Logia in **Hebrew**.
*   **Not Our Gospels:** Mead argues these descriptions do not match our current Mark (which has order) or Matthew (which is Greek, not a translation). Papias likely knew different, earlier documents.

### 3. Justin Martyr (c. 145-149 A.D.)
*   **Memoirs of the Apostles:** Justin quotes from "Memoirs," but his quotations often vary significantly from the Canonical texts, suggesting he used a harmony or a different version of the gospel story. He does not seem to recognize the Fourth Gospel (John).

### 4. The Muratorian Fragment (c. 170 A.D.)
*   **First Clear Evidence:** This is the first clear list of the Gospels, but it contains legendary accounts (e.g., John fasting with Andrew) that Mead views as unhistorical.

## 🧠 Critical Analysis
*   **Late Recognition:** The four Gospels only emerge clearly after 150 A.D.
*   **Fluid Tradition:** Before this date, there was a fluid mass of oral traditions, "Sayings" collections (like the Oxyrhynchus Logia), and various "Memoirs," not a fixed canon.
*   **Conclusion:** The traditional dates and authors assigned by the Church Fathers are unreliable and often born of apologetic necessity (e.g., attributing Luke to a follower of Paul).
