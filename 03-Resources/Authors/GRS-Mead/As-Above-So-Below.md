## Executive Summary
In this essay, G.R.S. Mead analyzes the famous Hermetic maxim **"As above, so below,"** warning against its common misuse and inversion by modern thinkers who try to measure the "above" (spiritual/noumenal) by the "below" (physical/phenomenal). He explores the nature of the **Astral Plane**, the continuity of matter, and the "Sacred Marriage" between Mind (Reason/Logos) and Sense.

## Key Concepts

### The Maxim and its Inversion
*   **True Meaning:** The maxim implies an analogical law where the lower is a reflection of the higher.
*   **The Error:** Mead argues that most people invert this to "As below, so above," projecting physical limitations and anthropomorphic ideas onto the divine. He calls this *Deus inversus est demon* (God inverted is the Devil).

### The Astral vs. Physical
*   **The Gulf:** Mead questions whether the "Astral" is a discrete degree separate from the physical or just a subtler grade of the same matter. He notes that seers often fail to communicate astral experiences without clothing them in physical symbols.
*   **Continuum of Matter:** He suggests a "continuum of matter" where the "sky is rolled up carpet-wise," meaning higher states are involved or folded into the lower.
*   **Fourth Dimension:** He criticizes the "Flatland" analogy for the fourth dimension as a *petitio principii* (begging the question), arguing that one cannot construct a higher dimension merely by extending the lower.

### Mind (Noumenon) vs. Sense (Phenomenon)
*   **The "Plane of Truth":** Mead distinguishes between the "sight" of the senses (which sees forms) and the "sight" of the Mind (which sees Reasons/Logos).
*   **Reification of Ideas:** He warns against "reifying" ideas (treating abstract concepts like gravity or atoms as physical things), which mistakes the shadow for the substance.
*   **The Sacred Marriage:** True wisdom requires the union of Mind and Sense, not their separation.

## Conclusion
Mead concludes that the "Above" is not a place but a state of being (Atman/Self). To truly understand "As above, so below," one must realize that the "Above" is the **Self** (Logos) present in all things.
