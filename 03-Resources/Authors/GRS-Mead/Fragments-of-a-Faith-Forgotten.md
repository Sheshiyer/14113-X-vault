## 📝 Executive Summary
This document outlines the structure and content of **G.R.S. Mead's** classic work, *Fragments of a Faith Forgotten*. It serves as a comprehensive introduction to **Gnosticism**, exploring the early Christian sects that were eventually suppressed by the orthodox church. Mead attempts to recover the "Gnosis" (knowledge) that was lost or forgotten.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. The Gnosis
*   Defined not as intellectual knowledge, but as direct spiritual insight or illumination.
*   The "Faith Forgotten" refers to this esoteric tradition that existed alongside and within early Christianity.

### 2. Structure of the Work
*   **Prolegomena:** Introduction to the study of Gnosticism.
*   **The Gnosis according to its Foes:** Analysis of Gnostic teachings as reported by early Church Fathers (Irenaeus, Hippolytus, etc.), who were often hostile critics.
*   **The Gnosis according to its Friends:** Examination of original Gnostic texts (Askew Codex, Bruce Codex) that survived.
*   **Some Outlines of Gnostic Aeonology:** Detailed breakdown of Gnostic cosmologies (Aeons, Pleroma, Sophia).

### 3. Key Figures & Sects
*   **Valentinus:** One of the most prominent Gnostic teachers.
*   **Basilides:** Another major Gnostic thinker.
*   **Marcion:** Known for rejecting the Old Testament deity.
*   **The Ophites/Naassenes:** Snake-worshipping sects (symbolizing wisdom).

## 🧠 Critical Analysis
*   **Historical Context:** Mead was writing in the late 19th/early 20th century (Theosophical Society), so his work predates the discovery of the **Nag Hammadi Library** (1945). However, it remains a foundational text for understanding how Gnosticism was viewed before those discoveries.
*   **Sympathetic Approach:** Unlike the Church Fathers, Mead approaches the Gnostics with sympathy, seeing them as possessors of a profound spiritual truth.
