## 📝 Executive Summary
This essay by **G.R.S. Mead** explores the "Synoptic Problem"—the question of how the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are related. Relying heavily on the work of Professor Schmiedel, Mead argues that the simple theories of borrowing (one evangelist copying another) or a single oral tradition are insufficient. He suggests a complex web of sources, including a "Little Apocalypse" and various collections of Logia.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. The Failure of Simple Hypotheses
*   **Oral Tradition:** Cannot explain the exact verbal agreements in the Greek text.
*   **Borrowing:** Theories that one copied another (e.g., Augustine's view) break down because every order of priority meets with fatal objections.

### 2. The Two-Source Theory (and beyond)
*   **Mark + Logia:** The standard view that Matthew and Luke used Mark and a lost collection of Sayings (Q).
*   **Mead's Critique:** Even this is too simple. He suggests "Proto-Mark," "Deutero-Mark," and multiple recensions of the Logia.
*   **The "Little Apocalypse":** Mead highlights the theory that Mark 13 (and parallels) incorporates a distinct Jewish apocalyptic leaflet from the time of the Jewish War (c. 70 A.D.).

### 3. Credibility and "Foundation Pillars"
*   **Schmiedel's Pillars:** The essay discusses Schmiedel's attempt to find "absolutely credible" passages—those that could not have been invented by the worshiping church (e.g., "Why callest thou me good?").
*   **Mead's Rebuttal:** Mead criticizes this reductionist "scientific" approach for stripping Jesus of his spiritual power and reducing him to *bourgeois* proportions. He argues that the "facts of religion" (inner spiritual experience) are missed by purely rationalistic criticism.

### 4. Conclusion
*   **Contemporaries:** Mead believes the three Synoptists were likely contemporaries writing in the early 2nd century (c. 117-138 A.D.), drawing from common sources but not necessarily copying each other directly.
