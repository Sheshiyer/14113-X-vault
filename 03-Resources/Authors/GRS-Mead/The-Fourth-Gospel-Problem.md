## 📝 Executive Summary
In this essay, **G.R.S. Mead** tackles the complex problem of the authorship and historicity of the **Fourth Gospel (John)**. He challenges the traditional ecclesiastical view that it was written by John the Apostle, arguing instead for a distinction between John the Apostle and "John the Elder," and highlighting the text's profound Gnostic and mystical character.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. The Two Johns
*   **John the Apostle:** The fisherman, "son of thunder," likely martyred early (according to Papias).
*   **John the Elder:** A "disciple of the Lord" (in a mystical sense) who lived at Ephesus. Mead suggests the confusion between these two led to the false attribution of the Gospel to the Apostle.

### 2. Contrast with Synoptics
*   **Differences:** The Fourth Gospel differs radically from the Synoptics (Matthew, Mark, Luke) in geography, chronology, and the portrayal of Jesus.
*   **The Logos:** The "Johannine Christ" is the pre-existent Logos, not the human teacher of the Synoptics.
*   **Mystical Tradition:** Mead argues the Fourth Gospel represents a "mystical tradition" of equal or greater spiritual authority than the "outer tradition" of the Synoptics, even if less historically accurate in a mundane sense.

### 3. Gnostic Influence
*   **The Prologue:** Mead suggests the Prologue (In the beginning was the Word...) might be a pre-existing Gnostic hymn or text adapted by the evangelist.
*   **Alexandrian Connection:** The ideas strongly reflect Alexandrian philosophy (Philo), suggesting the author was influenced by or connected to that school.

### 4. Conclusion on Authorship
*   **Uncertainty:** "We have no certain fact as to authorship from internal evidence."
*   **Date:** Mead is inclined to assign an early date (c. 100-140 AD) but acknowledges the difficulty in proving it.

## 🧠 Critical Analysis
*   **Mead's Stance:** He values the Gospel highly for its spiritual content ("The Gnosis") but refuses to sacrifice intellectual honesty to "save" its traditional authorship. He sees it as a document of *spiritual experience* rather than *historical biography*.
