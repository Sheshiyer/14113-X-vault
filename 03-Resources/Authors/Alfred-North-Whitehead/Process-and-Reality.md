## 📝 Executive Summary
*Process and Reality* is Alfred North Whitehead's magnum opus, originally delivered as the Gifford Lectures (1927-28). It establishes the **Philosophy of Organism** (Process Philosophy), a cosmological scheme that rejects the static materialism of the 19th century in favor of a dynamic, relational view of reality. The universe is described not as a collection of enduring substances, but as a process of becoming, composed of "actual entities" or "occasions of experience."

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. The Philosophy of Organism
*   **Actual Entities:** The fundamental units of reality. They are not static "things" but drops of experience, complex and interdependent. "The final real things of which the world is made."
*   **Prehensions:** The way actual entities "grasp" or feel other entities. This is the concrete mode of relatedness.
*   **Nexus:** A set of actual entities in the unity of the relatedness constituted by their prehensions of each other.
*   **The Ontological Principle:** "No actual entity, no reason." Everything must be explained by reference to actual entities.

### 2. Critique of Traditional Philosophy
*   **Rejection of "Vacuous Actuality":** The idea that something can be real without any subjective experience or feeling.
*   **Rejection of Subject-Predicate Logic:** The belief that the grammatical structure of "subject + quality" reflects the metaphysical structure of "substance + attribute."
*   **Recurrence to Pre-Kantian Thought:** Whitehead seeks to fuse the insights of Plato with the cosmology of the 17th century (Descartes, Newton, Locke), while correcting their inconsistencies.

### 3. God and the World
*   **Primordial Nature of God:** The eternal ordering of possibilities (eternal objects).
*   **Consequent Nature of God:** The physical prehension by God of the evolving world; the "fluency of things" is retained in God's everlasting nature.

## 🧠 Critical Analysis
*   **Complexity:** The text is notoriously difficult, requiring a shift from "substance-thinking" to "process-thinking."
*   **Significance:** It provides a metaphysical foundation for understanding quantum mechanics, ecology, and the relationship between science and religion (Panentheism).
