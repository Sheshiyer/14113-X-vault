## 📝 Executive Summary
This document serves as an index and overview of the **Meru Foundation's** research, led by the late **Stan Tenen** (passed 2022). The core thesis is that the Hebrew alphabet and the text of Genesis preserve a "Science of Consciousness" encoded in geometry and gesture. The page collects testimonials from scholars in mathematics, Judaic studies, and physics who validate the depth and rigor of Tenen's findings.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. The Geometric Alphabet
*   **Thesis:** The Hebrew letters are not arbitrary shapes but 2D shadows of a specific 3D geometric form (a torus knot or "First Hand" gesture).
*   **Genesis 1:1:** The pattern of letters in the first verse of Genesis generates this geometric form.

### 2. Science of Consciousness
*   **Pattern Recognition:** The research bridges ancient wisdom and modern science (topology, physics), suggesting the Torah contains a schematic for the unfolding of consciousness from unity to multiplicity.

### 3. Scholarly Testimonials
*   **Ralph Abraham (Mathematician):** Calls Tenen "among the most important students of Kabbalah of recent times."
*   **Louis H. Kauffman (Mathematician):** Describes the work as creating a "geometric language" that brings together origins of language and modern geometric thinking.
*   **Rabbi Dr. Meir Sendor:** States that Tenen's work provides a "key" to understanding difficult Kabbalistic texts.
