## 📝 Executive Summary
This essay defines prayer not as a means to impose one's will on the world, but as a mechanism of **sacrifice**—specifically, the sacrifice of the **ego** and personal will to align with the Will of HaShem (God). It outlines the "Manifesting Principle" as a process of knowing what you want, sacrificing yourself to the work, and then releasing the outcome.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. The Mechanism of Prayer
*   **Tzimtzum:** God withdrew to create a "vacant space" and gave us a portion of His Will (Free Will).
*   **Return:** Prayer is the act of returning our portion of Will back to God when our own ability is insufficient.
*   **Sacrifice:** All prayer involves sacrifice.
    *   **Simple Prayer:** From the heart (like a child).
    *   **Intellectual Prayer:** For adults, this involves sacrificing the *illusions of the ego*.

### 2. The "Manifesting Principle"
Tenen outlines a 3-step process for effective prayer/manifestation:
1.  **Know what you want:** Do the intellectual work to understand the goal and its cost.
2.  **Sacrifice your (ego)self:** Put heart and soul into the work in the physical world. Work beyond the point of giving up.
3.  **Return your will:** Give up expectations, be patient, and pay attention.

> "The manifesting principle only works when a person has made a real sacrifice and has continued to work even while they have let go of their expectations of the outcome they desire."
