## 📝 Executive Summary
This document contains a letter from **Stan Tenen**, Director of the **Meru Foundation**, discussing the nature of their research into the Hebrew alphabet and the Torah (Genesis). Tenen argues that the Hebrew text is not just a religious narrative or a code in the cryptographic sense, but a **mathematical and geometric description of a "science of consciousness."**

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Objective Research vs. Subjective Interpretation
*   Tenen distinguishes Meru's work from "New Age" or purely mystical interpretations.
*   He claims their findings are **objective**, **reproducible**, and based on geometric logic (like the "Light in the Meeting Tent" metaphor).
*   The goal is to find a "common truth" that transcends individual belief systems.

### 2. The Nature of Hebrew
*   **Verbs vs. Nouns:** Tenen suggests that Hebrew roots should be understood primarily as **verbs** (processes/functions) rather than nouns (objects).
*   **Gesture Language:** The shape of the Hebrew letters is derived from a natural human hand gesture language, representing a torus knot (the "First Hand").

### 3. The Science of Consciousness
*   The Torah is proposed to be a manual for generating specific states of consciousness.
*   By understanding the geometric dance of the letters, one can access the "transpersonal" or "divine" perspective.
*   This connects ancient wisdom with modern topology and physics.

## 🧠 Critical Analysis
*   **Geometric Rigor:** The core of Tenen's argument rests on the geometric coherence of his models (e.g., the 3-D spiral form of Genesis 1:1).
*   **Universalism:** While rooted in Judaism, the implications are universal, suggesting a biological and geometric basis for spiritual experience common to all humans.
