## Executive Summary
In this short essay, Stan Tenen addresses the classic theological paradox: **How can humans have genuine free will if God (Hashem) is omniscient and knows all outcomes in advance?** Tenen proposes a solution based on the **Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics** and the concept of God's Infinity.

## Key Arguments

### The Paradox
1.  If God is outside of time and knows all history, our choices seem pre-determined.
2.  If choices are pre-determined, how can a just God hold us responsible for our actions?

### The Quantum Solution
*   **Multiple Universes:** Tenen suggests that at any moment of choice, *all* possible options are actually realized in different alternative universes (as per the Many Worlds theory).
*   **God's Perspective:** God, being Infinite, is aware of *all* these infinite alternative "us's" and all their respective outcomes. Thus, God knows everything that happens in every possible timeline.
*   **Human Perspective:** We, as finite beings, are only aware of the *one* specific path we choose. We navigate through these possibilities via our choices.
*   **The "Golden Rule":** Each version of "us" ends up in a world that reflects the choices made by that specific version.

### Reconciliation
*   **Free Will:** We retain free will because we determine *which* of the infinite paths we experience. We "identify" ourselves by our choices.
*   **Determinism:** The system is deterministic from God's view (all paths exist and are known), but open from our view (we choose our path).
*   **Identity:** We and God only identify a specific "us" *after* a choice is made. Before the choice, there are no distinct "ones" to identify.

## Conclusion
The paradox is resolved by understanding that God's omniscience covers the entire "multiverse" of possibilities, while human free will consists of navigating a specific trajectory within that infinite landscape.
