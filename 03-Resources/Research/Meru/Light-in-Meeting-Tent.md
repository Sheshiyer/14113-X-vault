## 📝 Executive Summary
This document is a foundational working paper from the **Meru Foundation**, originally written in 1986. It introduces the core hypothesis that the Hebrew alphabet is derived from the shadow projections of a specific 3-dimensional geometric form—a **vortex** (flame) within a **tetrahedron** (tent). This model, the "TetraFlame," is presented as a bridge between symmetry and asymmetry, structure and process, and as a universal pattern found in embryology, topology, and consciousness.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. The TetraFlame Model
*   **The Tetrahedron (Structure):** Represents total symmetry, the "Meeting Tent," the "vessel," or the "thorn." Defined by 7 radii/vectors.
*   **The Vortex (Process):** Represents total asymmetry, the "Light" or "Flame" inside the tent. Modeled as a 1 3/4-turn spiral vortex (half of a 3-turn torus knot).
*   **The Synthesis:** The interaction of these two forms generates the letters of the Hebrew (and potentially Greek and Arabic) alphabets as shadow projections when viewed from different angles.

### 2. Philosophical Dualities
The paper posits that reality is composed of complementary dualities that are resolved in the TetraFlame model:
*   Structure / Process
*   Particle / Wave
*   Male / Female
*   Symmetry / Asymmetry
*   Tumin (Perfections) / Urim (Lights)

### 3. The "Lah" and Growth
*   The "Lah" is a flame-shaped vortex (resembling a calla lily).
*   It models the **embryonic growth process** and the unfolding of dimensions.
*   It corresponds to the sequence of Platonic solids.

### 4. Developmental Stages (Hebrew Letters)
The paper correlates the first letters of the Hebrew alphabet with stages of child personality development (referencing a NOVA program):
*   **Alef:** Birth / Undifferentiated interest.
*   **Bet:** Self-regulation / First distinction (Inside vs. Outside).
*   **Gimel:** Falling in love / Interaction.
*   **Dalet:** Communication / Trust.
*   **Hey:** Complex self-sense / Initiative.
*   **Vav:** Organized creation of ideas / "Mind's eye".
*   **Zayin:** High-level sense of self / Cause & Effect.

## 🌐 Interdisciplinary Connections
Tenen suggests the TetraFlame model serves as a unifying tool for:
*   **Topology & Geometry:** Torus knots, Platonic solids.
*   **Physics:** Elementary particles, holography.
*   **Biology:** DNA topology, embryology.
*   **Religion:** The Tabernacle, the "Flame in the Vessel," Kabbalah.
