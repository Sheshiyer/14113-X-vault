## 📝 Executive Summary
This extensive article by **Michael Tsarion** argues for a radical revision of ancient history, positing that civilization, language, and religion originated in the West (specifically Ireland/Hyperborea) and moved East, rather than the conventional East-to-West narrative. Tsarion uses **etymology** (the study of word origins) to deconstruct common historical terms, arguing that many biblical and historical names are corruptions of earlier "Aryan" or Druidic titles related to astro-theology, the Stellar Cult, and goddess worship.

## 🔑 Key Arguments

### 1. Western Origins (The Aryan/Irish Thesis)
*   **Thesis:** The "Hebrews," "Phoenicians," and "Aryans" were originally the same caste of Western sages (Druids/Ibaru) from Ireland and the North Atlantic (Hyperborea).
*   **Migration:** These groups migrated East to Egypt, India, and Persia, bringing civilization, writing, and the "Stellar Cult" with them.
*   **Deception:** Conventional history and the Judeo-Christian tradition are viewed as a "holy art of deception" designed to conceal these Western origins and the ancient goddess/stellar religion.

### 2. The True Meaning of "Hebrew"
*   **Ibaru / Hibernia:** Tsarion argues "Hebrew" derives from *Ibaru* or *Hibernia* (Ireland), meaning "The Sacred Ones" or "Men of the River" (River of Knowledge).
*   **Not a Race:** Originally a title for the learned priestly caste, not a specific ethnic group.

### 3. Astro-Theological Etymology
Tenen provides a long list of re-interpreted words, linking them to the Sun, Moon, Stars, and ancient Cults (Stellar, Solar, Lunar, Saturnian).

#### Selected Etymologies:
*   **Abraham:** From *Brahma* (Hindu creator god).
*   **Ark:** From *Arche* (First/Highest) or *Arca* (Womb).
*   **Bible:** From *Byblos* (Phoenician city).
*   **Christ:** From *Karast* (Egyptian for Anointed/Mummy).
*   **Church:** From *Circe* (Greek goddess) or *Kirk* (Circle).
*   **Cohen:** From *Cahen* (Serpent Priest).
*   **Druid:** From *Dru* (Oak/Truth) or *Vid* (Knowledge).
*   **God:** From *Gott* -> *Goat* (Symbol of the horned god/Capricorn).
*   **Holy:** From *Helios* (Sun) or *Halo*.
*   **Israel:** Linked to *Isis*, *Ra*, *El* (Egyptian/Canaanite trinity).
*   **Jew / Judah:** From *Yew* (Sacred Tree) or *Iauda*.
*   **Master:** *Ma* (Measure) + *Ster* (Star) = Astrologer.
*   **Minister:** *Min* (Moon) + *Ster* (Star).
*   **Moses:** From *Mosis* (Son) or *Meshe* (Initiator).
*   **Pastor:** *Pa* (Father) + *Stor* (Star) = Shepherd of the Stars.
*   **Vatican:** From *Vates* (Prophets/Druids).

## ⚔️ Polemic Stance
The text is highly critical of "mythmongers," "duplicitous historians," and the "Judeo-Christian" establishment, accusing them of appropriating and corrupting ancient pagan wisdom.
