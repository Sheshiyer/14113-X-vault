## Key Excerpts

### Genesis 6 (The Bible)
> "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose."

### The Book of Enoch
*   **The Transgression:** The "Angels, the children of heaven" lusted after human women and descended to "beget us children."
*   **Corrupting Knowledge:** They taught mankind "charms and enchantments."
*   **The Nephilim (Giants):** The women gave birth to "great giants" who:
    *   Consumed all the acquisitions of men.
    *   Turned against mankind and devoured them.
    *   Devoured one another's flesh and drank blood.
*   **The Judgment:** The text condemns the angels for forsaking their spiritual, eternal nature to "pollute themselves with women" and beget "flesh and blood" offspring.

## Significance
This narrative is central to many alternative history and conspiracy theories (e.g., Michael Tsarion, David Icke) regarding the origins of "bloodlines," secret societies, and the suppression of human consciousness.
