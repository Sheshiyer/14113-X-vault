# The Knights of the Golden Circle: A Conspiracy Thread

## Metadata
*   **Source:** `The Knights of the Golden Circle` (Twitter Thread / Unrolled)
*   **Topics:** Knights of the Golden Circle (KGC), Civil War, Slavery, Freemasonry, Albert Pike, Conspiracy, New World Order
*   **Context:** An unrolled Twitter thread exploring the history and alleged modern influence of the KGC.

## Key Claims

### The Order's Purpose
*   **Slave Empire:** Founded in 1854 by George W. Bickley, the KGC aimed to create a "Golden Circle" slaveholding empire centered in Havana, encompassing the Southern US, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.
*   **Subversion:** They operated as a "Fifth Column" in the North during the Civil War.

### Masonic Connections
*   **Albert Pike:** The thread claims Albert Pike (33° Mason) was a prominent leader of the KGC and a "Crypto-Jew." It links him to the "Three World Wars" letter and the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion*.
*   **Lincoln Assassination:** Suggests the KGC (and John Wilkes Booth) orchestrated Lincoln's assassination.

### Modern Relevance
*   **The Plan Continues:** The thread argues that although the KGC failed to create their empire in the 19th century, their "Luciferian" agenda for a New World Order continues through modern Zionism and global conflict (WWIII).
*   **Buried Gold:** Mentions legends of massive amounts of gold buried by the KGC to fund future operations.

## Critical Note
This text represents a specific strain of conspiracy theory that blends historical facts (the existence of the KGC) with anti-Masonic and anti-Zionist narratives (Albert Pike, Protocols of Zion).
