## Description
This is a reference to the classic paper "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" by Thomas Nagel.

**Key Idea:**
Nagel argues against reductionist accounts of the mind, asserting that an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to *be* that organism—something it is like *for* the organism. He uses the example of a bat (which perceives the world via echolocation) to illustrate the subjective character of experience, which cannot be fully captured by objective physical descriptions.
