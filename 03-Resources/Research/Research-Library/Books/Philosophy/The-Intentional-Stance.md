## Description
"How are we able to understand and anticipate each other in everyday life, in our daily interactions? Through the use of such 'folk' concepts as belief, desire, intention, and expectation, asserts Daniel Dennett in this first full-scale presentation of a theory of intentionality that he has been developing for almost twenty years. We adopt a stance, he argues, a predictive strategy of interpretation that presupposes the rationality of the people—or other entities—we are hoping to understand and predict."

**Key Concepts:**
- **The Intentional Stance:** A predictive strategy where we treat an entity as a rational agent with beliefs and desires.
- **Radical Interpretation:** Principles with implications for the status of folk psychology and cognitive science.
- **Evolutionary Theory & AI:** The book explores connections to these fields.
