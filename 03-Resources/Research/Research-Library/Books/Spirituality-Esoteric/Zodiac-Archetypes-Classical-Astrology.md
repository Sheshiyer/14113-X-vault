*   **Dramaturgy Connection:** Compares Zodiac signs to standard character types in fiction and drama (Protagonist, Antagonist, Hero, Mentor, Shadow, Jester, etc.).
*   **Structure:** Each archetype is derived from a unique combination of **Element** (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and **Quality** (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable).
