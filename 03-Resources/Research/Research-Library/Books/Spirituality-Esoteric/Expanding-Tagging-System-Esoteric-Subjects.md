# Expanding Tagging System for Esoteric Subjects

## Metadata
*   **Source:** AI Conversation Log (Claude)
*   **Topics:** Zettelkasten, Tagging System, Taxonomy, Esoteric Science, Trivium, Quadrivium, Knowledge Management
*   **Context:** A conversation developing a comprehensive, hierarchical tagging system for a personal knowledge base (Zettelkasten), specifically designed to integrate mainstream and esoteric subjects.

## Key Points
*   **Objective:** To create a detailed, multi-level tagging taxonomy for categorizing diverse documents (articles, books, videos) within a Zettelkasten system.
*   **Taxonomy Evolution:**
    *   Started with standard categories (Technology, Health, Business).
    *   Expanded to include "Esoteric Science," "Inner Wisdom," "Financial Freedom," "Psychology," "Philosophy," "Geometry," "Math," "Music," "Astrology," "Divination Arts," "Mysticism," and "Theology."
    *   Refined into a hierarchical structure with up to 3 levels of depth (e.g., Technology > AI > Machine Learning).
*   **Integration of Classical Arts:** The final iteration incorporates the **Trivium** (Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric) and **Quadrivium** (Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Astronomy) as primary or integrated categories.
*   **Key Categories Developed:**
    *   **Quantum Sciences & Consciousness:** Quantum Consciousness, Biofield Sciences, Neurotheology.
    *   **Sacred Economics:** Ethical Business, Regenerative Practices, Transpersonal Economics.
    *   **Esoteric Geometry:** Psychogeometry, Sacred Geometry, Fractals.
    *   **Harmonic Studies:** Psychoacoustics, Sound Healing, Harmonic Theology.
    *   **Chronobiology:** Circadian Rhythms, Archetypal Astrology.
    *   **Mind-Body Practices:** Neuroplasticity, Epigenetics, Holistic Health.
    *   **Transpersonal Psychology:** Psychedelic Philosophy, Mysticism, Inner Wisdom.
    *   **Evolutionary Studies:** Conscious Evolution, Transhumanism.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** The document contains specific prompt templates designed to instruct an AI to:
    1.  Categorize content using this custom taxonomy.
    2.  Summarize the content in 3-5 sentences.
    3.  Identify key concepts and generate **Obsidian-style links** (e.g., `[[Concept Name]]`) to build a connected knowledge graph.
