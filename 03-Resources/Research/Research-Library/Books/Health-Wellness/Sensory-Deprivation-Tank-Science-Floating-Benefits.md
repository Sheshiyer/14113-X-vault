## Key Points
*   **Definition:** Sensory deprivation involves floating in an isolation tank filled with water and Epsom salts at body temperature, cutting off sound, sight, smell, and touch.
*   **Mechanism:** Induces a deep state of relaxation (Relaxation Response) by lowering cortisol, calming the nervous system, and activating the parasympathetic nervous system.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Mindfulness & Stress:** significant reductions in stress, depression, anxiety, and pain; improvements in optimism and sleep quality.
    *   **Anxiety & Depression:** Effective for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), with some achieving full remission.
    *   **Productivity:** Helps prevent burnout, mental fatigue, and improves focus.
    *   **Pain Relief:** Acts as a natural painkiller by easing muscle tension and promoting recovery.
    *   **Addiction:** Aids in overcoming addictions (smoking, overeating, etc.) by inducing relaxation and disrupting habits.
*   **Experience:** Floaters feel light and peaceful. The water is skin temperature, creating a feeling of "nothingness."
*   **Risks:** Generally safe, but potential for claustrophobia or hygiene issues (rare).
*   **Cost:** Typically $30-$150 per session.
