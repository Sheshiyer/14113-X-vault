## 📝 Executive Summary
This document summarizes a lecture by **Douglas C. Wallace**, a pioneer in mitochondrial genetics. He argues that modern medicine's focus on anatomy and nuclear genetics overlooks the critical role of **bioenergetics**. Mitochondria, the power plants of the cell, have their own DNA (mtDNA) and are central to understanding complex diseases, aging, and human migration.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Origin & Function
*   **Symbiosis:** Mitochondria originated from bacteria that entered a symbiotic relationship with a eukaryotic host cell billions of years ago.
*   **OXPHOS:** They generate energy (ATP) through **Oxidative Phosphorylation**.
*   **Dual Genetics:** Humans have two genomes:
    *   **Nuclear DNA (nDNA):** Inherited from both parents, encodes structure.
    *   **Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA):** Inherited **exclusively from the mother**, encodes energy production.

### 2. Mitochondrial Genetics
*   **High Mutation Rate:** mtDNA mutates much faster than nDNA due to lack of protective histones and proximity to reactive oxygen species (ROS).
*   **Heteroplasmy:** A cell can contain a mixture of normal and mutant mitochondria.
*   **Threshold Effect:** Disease symptoms only appear when the proportion of mutant mitochondria exceeds a certain bioenergetic threshold.

### 3. Disease & Aging
*   **Energy Deficiency:** Many common diseases (Diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Heart Disease) are fundamentally problems of energy failure, not just structural defects.
*   **The Warburg Effect:** Cancer cells switch from efficient mitochondrial respiration to inefficient glycolysis (fermentation) to support rapid growth.
*   **Aging:** Caused by the accumulation of mtDNA mutations over a lifetime, leading to a gradual decline in bioenergetic efficiency.

### 4. Human Migration
*   **Molecular Clock:** Because mtDNA is maternally inherited and mutates at a constant rate, it allows researchers to trace human lineages back to a single "Mitochondrial Eve" in Africa (~200,000 years ago) and map global migration patterns.

## 🧠 Critical Analysis
*   **Paradigm Shift:** Wallace calls for a shift from a "structural" view of medicine to an "energetic" view.
*   **Therapeutic Implications:** Treating mitochondrial dysfunction could be the key to curing age-related degenerative diseases.
