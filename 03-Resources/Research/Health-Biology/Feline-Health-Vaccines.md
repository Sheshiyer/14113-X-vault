## Introduction

Prevention is powerful. It provides us with something intangible and yet priceless - peace of mind. What are we willing to do to obtain it? It turns out, quite a bit, which makes us exploitable. We have been sold a bill of goods about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and the lack of other alternatives.

It’s time for us to take back the responsibility we’ve carelessly given away. We don’t want to blame ourselves if our pet dies from an infection, so we leave it to the vet. We don’t want to deal with our pet’s diet, so we trust pet food companies.

## Lulu’s Story

I write this with teary eyes as I say goodbye to my first cat and best friend for over 11 years - Lulu (Sept 2013 - June 2024). She gave me over a decade of lessons, companionship, and affection.

### Mistakes Made (The "Don'ts")

1.  **Kibble Diet**: I thought feeding cats was simple; I just bought a large, cheap bag of kibble and kept her bowl filled all the time.
    *   *Consequence*: Cats on kibble are always thirsty. Their blood glucose is on a roller-coaster. It can lead to urinary and endocrine issues, and obesity. Lulu had dental plaque and likely kidney/thyroid issues from this.
2.  **Over-Vaccination**: I followed the vet’s advice and vaccinated her every year for six years.
    *   *Consequence*: Lulu became timid, picky with food, and disconnected. She showed signs of neurological damage (ataxia, muscle stiffness, uneven eye movements).
    *   *Injection Site*: Small animals are often vaccinated on the shoulder blades, a sensitive area near the brain/spine.
3.  **Flea Medications**: Used Fipronil. Parasites only show up when the terrain is polluted. These are neurotoxins.

### What I Would Do Differently (The "Dos")

1.  **Diet**: **Never give dry cat food.** Switch to a **raw diet** (meat, bones, organs).
    *   *Observation*: When I switched Lulu to raw fish/meat in her later years, her coughing stopped, her teeth improved, and she regained some vitality.
    *   *Tip*: For senior pets, smash meaty bones with a hammer to prevent choking.
2.  **Vaccination**:
    *   I wouldn’t vaccinate.
    *   If I did, I’d do it **once** (single vaccines, not cocktails) and never again. One vaccine protects for a lifetime.
    *   Never vaccinate during surgery or if the cat is pregnant.
3.  **Feeding Schedule**: Two small meals a day. No free-feeding.
4.  **Spaying**: Spay late (after a litter or two) to allow full hormonal development.

## Holistic Care Insights

*   **Raw Diet**: Cats are obligate carnivores. They need moisture and fresh nutrients found in raw meat.
*   **Flea Control**:
    *   *Internal*: Healthy animals resist fleas. Garlic/Brewer's yeast can help (check for allergies).
    *   *External*: Diatomaceous earth, herbal rinses (lemon, lavender - *avoid essential oils toxic to cats*), frequent vacuuming (borax on carpets). Avoid chemical collars/drops.
*   **Homeopathy**: Can be very effective for animals. *Ledum* for bites, *Sulphur* for infestations.

## Conclusion

"Cats have a high birth rate to balance their high death rate. They represent both life and death, which is why they were considered sacred in ancient Egypt and why some people today are scared of them."

If you can do one thing right: **Switch to a raw diet and don’t over-vaccinate.**
