# Jack Kruse: Skin in the Game

## Metadata
*   **Source:** `Dr. Jack Kruse | Skin in the Game` (Landing Page)
*   **Topics:** Skin, Sunlight, Mitochondria, Leptin, Wireless Communication
*   **Context:** Introduction to a lecture/series (Nourish Vermont 2018) on the biophysics of skin.

## Key Points
*   **Skin as Solar Panel:** The skin is not just a barrier; it stands between the sun and our mitochondria. It captures light, water, and magnetism.
*   **Wireless Biology:** The skin works with the sun and mitochondria in a "wireless fashion" to build wellness.
*   **Obesity:** Kruse argues obesity begins in the eye (light environment) and skin, not just with food or exercise.
*   **Mechanism:** Nature adds lipid droplets (subcutaneous fat) to the skin to create a "laser" that changes sunlight into coherent light, activating metabolic programs.
