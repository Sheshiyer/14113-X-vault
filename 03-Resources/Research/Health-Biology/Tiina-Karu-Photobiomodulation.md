# Tiina Karu: Photobiomodulation Research Profile

## Metadata
*   **Source:** ResearchGate Profile (`Tiina Karu Laser Technology Research Center...`)
*   **Subject:** Tiina Karu (Head of Laboratory of Laser Biomedicine, Russian Academy of Science)
*   **Topics:** Photobiomodulation (Low-Level Laser Therapy), Mitochondria, Cytochrome c Oxidase, Cell Biology
*   **Context:** This file is a bibliography/profile listing key publications by Tiina Karu, a pioneer in the field of laser therapy mechanisms.

## Research Focus
Tiina Karu's work focuses on the **cellular and molecular mechanisms of photobiomodulation (PBM)**, specifically how monochromatic light (red to near-infrared) interacts with biological tissues to promote healing and regeneration.

### Key Mechanisms Identified
1.  **Cytochrome c Oxidase:** Identified as the primary **photoacceptor** in the mitochondria. Absorption of light by this enzyme accelerates electron transfer in the respiratory chain.
2.  **Mitochondrial Signaling:** Light absorption leads to **retrograde mitochondrial signaling**, where mitochondria send signals to the nucleus to alter gene expression (e.g., increasing cell proliferation, attachment, and metabolism).
3.  **ATP Production:** Irradiation increases intracellular ATP levels, providing energy for cellular repair.
4.  **Nitric Oxide (NO):** PBM may involve the release of Nitric Oxide from the catalytic center of cytochrome c oxidase, mediating vasodilation and signaling.

## Selected Publications (from list)
*   *Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Photobiomodulation (Low-Power Laser Therapy)* (2014)
*   *Is It Time to Consider Photobiomodulation As a Drug Equivalent?* (2013)

## Significance
Tiina Karu is widely regarded as the leading authority on the *mechanism of action* for low-level light therapy, moving the field from anecdotal "magic" to a scientifically grounded biochemical process based on mitochondrial photochemistry.
