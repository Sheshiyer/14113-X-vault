## Key Points
- **Personal Story:** The author shares the life and death of their cat, Lulu (2013-2024).
- **Critique of Conventional Vet Care:**
    - **Vaccines:** The author believes over-vaccination (especially annual boosters and injection sites like the shoulder blades) caused Lulu's neurological decline and autoimmune issues. Cites "vaccinosis" and damage to cranial nerves.
    - **Kibble:** Describes dry food (kibble) as an "unnatural diet" causing dehydration, dental plaque, and kidney issues.
    - **Flea/Tick Meds:** Views chemical flea treatments (neurotoxins) as harmful. Suggests natural alternatives (diatomaceous earth, herbal rinses).
- **Advocacy for Natural Care:**
    - **Raw Diet:** Advocates for feeding cats raw meat/fish. Claims it resolved coughing and improved health.
    - **Minimal Vaccination:** Suggests one-time vaccination or none at all.
    - **Late Spaying:** Suggests waiting to spay.
- **Homeopathy:** Mentions using homeopathy (e.g., *Sulphur*, *Ledum*) for ailments.

### Introduction
Prevention is powerful. It provides us with something intangible and yet priceless - peace of mind. We have been sold a bill of goods about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and the lack of other alternatives.

### Lulu’s Story
I adopted Lulu Monkiss in September 2013. She was my first cat. I fed her kibble and followed the vet's advice to vaccinate her annually for six years. I now believe this was a mistake.

**Mistakes Made:**
*   **Kibble Diet:** "Kibble, an unnatural diet, along with the sinister effects of vaccination, is a death spell to young cats." Cats on kibble are chronically dehydrated.
*   **Over-Vaccination:** "I should’ve stopped after one vaccine, which protects for a lifetime... I followed the vet’s advice and vaccinated her every year for six years."
*   **Injection Sites:** "Small animals are usually vaccinated on their shoulder blades and that’s a huge problem because of its proximity to the brain and spinal cord."

**Health Decline:**
Lulu developed neurological problems, stiffness (Ataxia), and behavioral changes (hiding, fear). The author attributes this to vaccine damage (metals like aluminum/mercury) and neurotoxins in flea medications.

### Natural Alternatives & Lessons
If I could do things over with Lulu, here’s what I would do differently:
1.  **No Dry Food:** Switch to a raw diet (meat/fish).
2.  **Minimal/No Vaccines:** "I wouldn’t vaccinate her. If I did... I’d only do it once."
3.  **Geriatric Care:** Be more watchful after 7-10 years.
4.  **Meal Frequency:** Two small meals a day.
5.  **Spaying:** Spay late, after a litter or two.

**Flea Control:**
*   **Avoid:** Chemical spot-treatments, collars, dips.
*   **Use:** Diatomaceous earth, borax (for house), herbal rinses (lemon), flea combs.
*   **Homeopathy:** *Sulphur* (for infestation), *Ledum* (for bites).

### Conclusion
"There is only one way you can do it right - switch to a raw diet and don’t over vaccinate your cat."
