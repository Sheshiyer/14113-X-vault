## Abstract
Melatonin is an indolamine hormone synthesized in the retina and pineal gland. It is thought to act as a paracrine neurohormone in the mammalian retina. Pinealectomy has been shown to protect photoreceptors from light-induced damage, and melatonin treatment has been reported to increase the degree of photoreceptor damage in albino rats.

To determine how melatonin influences photoreceptor survival, the effect of melatonin administration on light-induced retinal damage was studied. Melatonin was administered to albino rats by intraperitoneal injections at various times before or after light exposure. The rats were exposed to high-intensity illumination (1600 lux) for 24 hr to induce photodamage, then returned to cyclic lighting for 12 days.

**Key Findings:**
- Animals receiving daily melatonin injections (100 micrograms) in the late afternoon (3 hr before lights off) for 1-3 days **before** photodamage showed an approximate **30% greater reduction** in outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness in the superior quadrant (the area most susceptible to light damage) compared with sham control animals.
- Melatonin injections given **after** the photodamage did not affect ONL thickness.
- The degree to which melatonin increased damage appeared unaffected by the time of day, although retinal susceptibility itself varied.

**Conclusion:** These results suggest that melatonin may be involved in some aspects of photoreceptor sensitivity to light damage.
