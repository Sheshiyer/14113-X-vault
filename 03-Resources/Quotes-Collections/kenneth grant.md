The benefits of this approach seem clear to all except for stubborn theorists. When deprived of the game of endlessly classifying the names and attributes of angels, demons, spirits, and so on, they find themselves on the edge of a great void with no choice but to leap directly into the Unknown. Trying to rationalize a fundamentally non-rational situation or evaluate the subconscious or 'True Will' by waking state standards — who is there to do either? The Mind's inclination for classification and analysis can lead it to overlook essential connections. Our subject may not be fully grasped by the mental faculty, but it succumbs to a unique form of inspiration that can be described as instantaneous insight of a supra-rational order. The Hindus called it prajna. Without it, no amount of explanation suffices to unravel the so-called mysteries of magic and mysticism.
