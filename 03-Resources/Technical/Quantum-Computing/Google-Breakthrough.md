Google has just unveiled
Willow
, a quantum computing chip that marks a major breakthrough in both error correction and computation speed, bringing us closer to practical quantum computers.
Here's what you need to know:
Willow reduces errors exponentially as more qubits are added, solving a challenge that has plagued quantum computing for over 30 years.
In a benchmark test, Willow completed a computational task in under five minutes that would take today's fastest supercomputers
10 septillion years
(10^25 years) to finish.
With
105 qubits
, Willow maintains quantum states
twice as long
as its predecessors, ensuring greater practical application.
It is the first system to achieve live error correction on a quantum platform, marking a key milestone.
Why it matters:
Willow represents a significant step forward in quantum computing, taking the technology from theoretical to practical opening new possibilities in critical fields like drug discovery, energy, and material science.
It’s impact on AI:
Willow’s speed can drastically accelerate AI model training and big data processing, enabling faster predictions and optimizations.
With parallel computing power, it can boost real-time decision-making in areas like autonomous vehicles, robotics, and finance, providing a competitive edge in building smarter systems.

Tesla Model Q set to launch in 2025
Tesla’s much-anticipated Model Q is set to hit the roads in the first half of 2025, starting at under $30,000 with subsidies (or $37,499 if Trump cancels the IRA tax credit). Built on Tesla’s existing production lines, the Model Q will be 15% smaller and 30% lighter than the Model 3, making it a compact, efficient alternative. While it will include a steering wheel and pedals, the design is geared for autonomous driving, pointing to Tesla’s vision for the future.

AI mimics brain to 'watch' videos
Inspired by how tadpole neurons process visuals, researchers at Scripps Research have developed MovieNet, an AI model that analyzes videos with unmatched precision. It achieved 82.3% accuracy in recognizing complex patterns, outperforming humans and even Google’s GoogLeNet. What’s even better? It’s eco-friendly, using less data and power. Early use cases, like detecting subtle movements in Parkinson’s diagnostics, highlight its game-changing potential in healthcare and beyond.

Reddit introduces ‘Reddit Answers’
Reddit has launched
Reddit Answers
, an AI-powered conversational tool that provides curated summaries of discussions, recommendations, and hot takes from across its platform. Users can ask questions and receive relevant snippets, links to communities, and follow-up suggestions, making it easier to dive into topics. Currently in English, the feature is rolling out to select U.S. users, with plans to expand globally.

$40M raised for empathetic AI voices
Former OpenAI researcher Alexis Conneau has raised $40M for WaveForms AI, a startup creating emotionally rich AI voice models. With backing from Andreessen Horowitz, the company is valued at $200M. WaveForms AI aims to make voice interactions indistinguishable from real conversations, emphasizing emotional depth.
SORA
OpenAI launches Sora
(Image credit: OpenAI)
OpenAI has finally launched
SORA
, its advanced AI video generator.
Early demos
have left users in awe with crisp visuals, versatile features, and the promise of redefining video creation though not without its limitations.
What you can do with SORA:
SORA offers text-to-video, image-to-video, and video-to-video capabilities.
You can play with different styles from photorealistic to abstract, SORA lets you generate videos in multiple styles, like
noir
,
papercraft
, and
archival
.
Storyboard
: Organize and edit your video sequences on a timeline, making it ideal for structured storytelling.
Remix
: Modify elements of existing videos—swap, remove, or reimagine scenes to give them a fresh twist.
Re-cut
: Automatically extend scenes by isolating the best frames, so you can create smoother transitions.
Blend
: Combine two videos into one seamless clip.
Loop
: Create videos that repeat seamlessly, great for backgrounds or any content needing continuous motion.
What’s still a bit rough:
While SORA excels in generating stunning abstract visuals, it has some challenges with realistic movements like awkward glitches and unstable object behaviors that detract from more natural scenes.
The catch:
It’s only available in the U.S. right now, with restricted access in places like the EU.
Videos are watermarked, and there are heavy content moderation rules to prevent creating anything too controversial or copyrighted. You also need to verify your age and prove you own the materials you upload.
Creating high-quality 1080p videos takes minutes, so it’s not the fastest tool on the block.
Early reactions:
MKBHD
gave SORA props for its abstract designs and stop-motion-style work but wasn’t impressed with the real-world physics.
Nick St. Pierre
liked the image-to-video functionality but felt the moderation restrictions were a bit much.
Why It Matters:
SORA has the potential to change the way we think about video creation, from educators to content creators to businesses. But, it’s clear there’s still work to be done before it’s truly polished.
