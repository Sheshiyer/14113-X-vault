Want to improve your productivity and habits more quickly? You’re in the right place. While 99% of the content I create is free, I also have some more in-depth courses that compress the most useful productivity lessons I’ve learned and systems I’ve created into quick, densely-packed lessons.
Not sure where to start with Notion? This is your ultimate beginner’s guide.
Notion Fundamentals is an ongoing course covering all the basics of Notion – pages, blocks, links, databases, and more.
It’s public, 100% free, and project-based – so you’ll be
building
while you learn.
You’re blowing up on YouTube, TikTok, or another social network. You’re getting tons of views.
Now how do you turn this into a business?
This course draws from my 10 years as a full-time creator and business owner, and will teach you the basics of business structure, finances, taxes, hiring, income diversification, and more.
Success in your long-term goals requires regular, incremental progress over a long period of time. In other words, it requires strong habits!
This course will help you to narrow down your goals (especially helpful if you have a lot), break the ones you’re focusing on down into actionable habits, and stick to those habits by combining self-discipline with smart external tools and systems.

Notion has become our “one tool to rule them all”, and after spending more than two years learning this tool
deeply,
I want to help other creators and teams get the most out of it.
