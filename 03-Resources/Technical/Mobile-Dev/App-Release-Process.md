releasing a mobile app can be tricky
with TP rules that could delay a launch
in this video we'll guide you through
releasing an app on both IOS and Android
grab a notpad we're about to share
essential tips and tricks to navigate
these challenges and release a
highquality app that users will enjoy
let's get started to start building our
IOS app we first need to join Apple's
developer program which comes with an
annual fee for Android we register as
developers on the Google Play console
and pay a one-time registration fee next
we choose a programming language Swift
or objective c for iOS cotland or Java
for Android rewrite our apps with key
development tools like xode for IOS and
Android Studio for Android alternatively
we might offer a crossplatform
development tool like react native or
flutter these let us write code once and
deploy it on both platforms they can
speed up development and reduce costs
however they may not always offer the
same performance or access to device
specific features as native
development once we written a code it's
time to build and test we compile our
apps binary and conduct thorough testing
using tools like XC test for iOS and
espresso for Android device forms help
us automate testing across hundreds of
device configurations catching issues
that could affect different Hardware or
Os versions this automation is
integrated into cicd pipelines to stream
line the build and test process our goal
is to deliver top-notch quality and
performance across all devices aiming
for a rock solid release candidate ready
for the next stage it's important to
mention that while device Farms a AWS
device Farm or browser stack provide
significant benefits they can be
expensive their use might be planned
later in the development cycle based on
budget allowances and project
requirements the next stage is QA it
starts with internal testing to catch
initial bugs followed by doc fooding
where the team uses the app extensively
after this we invite a group of users to
try the app and provide feedback through
beta testing platforms like Apple's test
flight and Google plays beta testing
it's important to note that test flight
limits us to 10,000 testers and Google
Play has different constraints we need
to choose external testers carefully to
gain the most meaningful Insight this
platform forms help us GA feedback under
real world conditions and identify any
issues that then service during earlier
testing
stages before we submit our app to the
stores we need to obtain internal
approvals this requires getting the
green light from key Stick holders
focusing on criteria like ux consistency
brand alignment and Technical
performance metrics we also need to make
sure our app meets all the necessary App
Store guidelines and adheres to Industry
regulations on security practices and
privacy
compliance App Store optimization is
about making our app more visible in the
App Stores it involves optimizing our
app's metadata such as titles
descriptions and keywords and localizing
our content for different regions to
boost search rankings and attract more
users it's also important to design
eye-catching screenshots and icons as
showcase our app's best features when it
comes to release notes get creative and
highlight all the exciting new updates
and
improvements now comes the Moment of
Truth app submission for iOS we submit
our app through App Store connect
closely following Apple strict
guidelines Android developers will
proceed via the Google Play console
adhering to Google's policies prepare
for potential delays and be patient
especially if it is a new app the app
review team sometimes may seem
unreasonably picky they may request
changes or additional information so
it's important to allow extra time for
this phase to obtain
approval finally it's time to release
our app to the world if possible
coordinate a simultaneous launch on both
IOS and Android platforms make sure our
marketing efforts are in full swing to
generate buzz and anticipation for the
launch this can maximize our visibility
and impact right out of the gate but the
journey doesn't end there once our apps
is live it's crucial to monitor user
feedback and Analytics we use this data
to improve and update the app fixing
bugs and adding new features based on
user demand we also engage with users
through reviews and social media to
build a loyal Community around the app
