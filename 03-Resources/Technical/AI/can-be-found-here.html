<p><strong><em>Informal Essays and e-list Postings</em></strong> <br/>
 The Meru Foundation participates in a number of electronic discussion lists focused on science and consciousness, or science and spirituality. From time to time, in process of responding to questions posed on these lists, Mr. Tenen writes impromptu mini-essays, discussing focused aspects of our work in greater depth than is possible in a more general essay.</p>
<ul> <li><a href="https://meru.org/Newsletter/textnotstories.html#title"><strong>Alternatives to Biblical Scholarship</strong></a> <br/> <i>e-list posting, December 1999</i> <br/> This essay was first published in the e-list <i>Meta-Reiterations</i>, in December 1999, as part of a discussion of <br/> the methods and assumptions of current academic Biblical scholarship. Specifically, Stan Tenen argues against the assumption that the Hebrew Biblical text was edited together over centuries. He offers an alternative thesis, and presents examples of meaning that can be uncovered once the scholarly assumptions of an edited, redacted text are set aside. This alternative way of examining the Biblical text -- as one whole unit, where each letter and word has meaning in its place -- is central to the Meru thesis about the origin and nature of the Hebrew alphabet and the Biblical text. </li> <li><a href="https://meru.org/Newsletter/documentary.html#title"><strong>When is the Textual Approach Not Appropriate?</strong></a> <br/> <i>e-list posting, April 2000</i> <br/> This essay was first published in the e-list Meta-Reiterations, in April 2000, as part of a discussion of the methods and assumptions of current academic Biblical scholarship. In this piece, Stan Tenen argues that the Five Books of Moses should be analyzed using different tools than those used to study other writings which are considered to be Western sacred texts, because the nature, and structure, of those Books differs in a profound and fundamental way. </li> <li><a href="https://meru.org/Newsletter/immortality.html#title"><strong>On Immortality</strong></a> <br/> <i>e-list posting, May 2000</i> <br/> The essay below was first published in the e-list Meta-Reiterations, in May 2000. In this piece, Stan Tenen introduces a possible mechanism for the survival of aspects of the soul beyond physical death. </li> <li><a href="https://meru.org/Newsletter/whichwayup.html#title"><strong>Which Way Up?</strong></a> <br/> <i>Informal Essay, September 2000</i> <br/> We want to grow, spiritually and emotionally.
