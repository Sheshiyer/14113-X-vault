This torrent contains:
The URL of every searchable Facebook user's profile
The name of every searchable Facebook user, both unique and by count (perfect for post-processing, datamining, etc)
Processed lists, including first names with count, last names with count, potential usernames with count, etc
The programs I used to generate everything
So, there you have it: lots of awesome data from Facebook. Now, I just have to find one more problem with Facebook so I can write "Revenge of the Facebook Snatchers" and complete the trilogy. Any suggestions? >:-)
Limitations
So far, I have only indexed the searchable users, not their friends. Getting their friends will be significantly more data to process, and I don't have those capabilities right now. I'd like to tackle that in the future, though, so if anybody has any bandwidth they'd like to donate, all I need is an ssh account and Nmap installed.
An additional limitation is that these are only users whose first characters are from the latin charset. I plan to add non-Latin names in future releases.},
