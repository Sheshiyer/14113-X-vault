Google DeepMind and Apptronik have joined forces to
develop humanoid robots
designed for dynamic, real-world environments. The partnership leverages DeepMind's expertise in AI and machine learning alongside Apptronik's decade-long experience in human-centered robotics design.
Here's what you need to know:
Apptronik, founded in 2016, has developed 15 robot models, including NASA’s Valkyrie, and is now focusing on its latest Apollo robot, standing 5’8 tall and weighing 73kgs.
Apollo is already used in Mercedes-Benz manufacturing facilities for repetitive tasks like delivering parts and inspecting components.
DeepMind’s Gemini AI models will enhance Apollo’s capabilities, integrating reasoning and real-world action for general-purpose tasks.
A recent demo showed Apollo using Gemini’s spatial reasoning to delicately play Jenga, guided by a simple text prompt.
Why it matters:
The partnership between Google DeepMind and Apptronik is only the second of its kind, following Figure's collaboration with OpenAI, highlighting a growing trend of pairing advanced AI with cutting-edge robotics.

AI-powered Blood Testing Show Potential for Early Disease Detection
Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering have developed AI-powered nanotube blood tests that detect diseases like ovarian cancer by analyzing molecular markers. The nanotubes emit light that AI interprets for early warning signs. Initial tests show it’s more accurate than traditional methods, with great potential for saving lives.

OPENAI O3
OpenAI to release ‘o3’ soon
OpenAI is reportedly developing its next-generation
"o3" reasoning model
, which will take more time to “think” about user queries before responding.
Here's what you need to know:
OpenAI opted to skip the name “o2” to avoid potential trademark conflicts with O2, a British telecommunications service provider.
The "o3" model is designed to improve upon o1’s reasoning capabilities, aiming for more natural and logically sound responses during interactions.
After facing a slowdown in gains from using more compute and data during pretraining, OpenAI invested heavily in its reasoning AI research and used a new pretrained model, Orion, to develop the o3 model.
Recently, Sam Altman hinted at the release of the next model on X with a playful “
oh oh oh
,” likely referring to o3.
(Source: Sam’s post)
Let's solve this:
ho ho ho = (h + o)(h + o)(h + o)
Since "h" is silent in Christmas:
o o o = o³ = o3
Keep an eye out for the official launch, it looks like it’s going to launch in coming days.
