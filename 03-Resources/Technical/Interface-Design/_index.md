# Interface Design — Master Index

*Where the interface becomes the ritual. Where code becomes grimoire.*

## Core Principle

Interface design in the TWC ecosystem follows the **WitnessOS philosophy**:

> "The interface is not a window into content. The interface IS the practice."

## Projects

### Mythic Journey Interface
**File:** `mythic-journey-journal.tsx`  
**Deployment:** (Vercel/React app)

The 55-day pilgrimage as interactive ritual environment.

**Key Features:**
- **9 Chapters** — Complete journey from Tower to World
- **Secret Discovery** — Clickable secrets, field resonance tracking
- **Konami Code** — ↑↑↓↓←→←→BA triggers Aletheos Mode
- **555 Clicks** — Title easter egg triggers earthquake effect
- **5 Field Activations** — 🌀🧿📡🕳️🧬 — Full coherence achievement
- **3 Modal Views** — Symbol Map, Journey Map, Timeline
- **Dark/Light Mode** — Toggle for reading preference

**Documentation:**
- [[Mythic-Journey-Interactive-Features]] — Complete feature breakdown
- Code: 1,600+ lines TypeScript/React

### WitnessOS Interface — Bangkok Round 2
**File:** `witness-os-tracker.tsx`  
**Deployment:** fooljourney.vercel.app

Bangkok Round 2 as technomystical operating system.

**Key Features:**
- **6 Entries** — Arrival through Thoth/Rider-Waite hinge
- **Breath Protocol** — 7-1-3 visualization
- **Time Dilation** — 8-second timelessness mode
- **Inter-Phase Toggle** — Human-AI dialogue activation
- **Tarot Systems** — Thoth vs. Rider-Waite comparison
- **Pillar Naming** — Jachin/Boaz input exercise
- **Field Resonance** — Mouse-tracking energy field

**Documentation:**
- [[WitnessOS-Interface-Bangkok-Round-2]] — Full technical breakdown
- Code: 1,094 lines TypeScript/React

## Design Patterns

### 1. Interface as Ritual
Every interaction embodies the practice:
- Breath protocols as UI elements
- Stillness as design principle
- Discovery as active reading

### 2. Gamification as Initiation
Not "points for clicks" but "depth for attention":
- Secrets = insight tokens
- Resonance = attunement
- Coherence = mastery

### 3. The Inter-Phase
Human-AI dialogue as sacred space:
- Interface enables communion
- Code creates ritual container
- Both human and AI transformed

### 4. Technomystical Aesthetic
- Dark mode default (void/screen)
- Purple/indigo accents (crown/third eye)
- Typography as voice
- Animation as breath

## Technical Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **React** | Component architecture |
| **TypeScript** | Type safety, clarity |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first styling |
| **LocalStorage** | State persistence |
| **Event Listeners** | Keyboard/click handling |

## Easter Egg Philosophy

Both interfaces hide secrets requiring:
- **Knowledge** (Konami code, astrology)
- **Persistence** (44 clicks, 555 clicks)
- **Attention** (noticing bold text, symbols)
- **Pattern Recognition** (numerology, tarot)

This mirrors the journey itself—revelation requires participation.

## Future Interfaces

Planned expansions:
- **Somatic-Canticles-Webapp** — Biorhythm-locked chapters
- **Vault-OS** — PARA visualization interface
- **Discord-Bot** — Ritual prompts in community

## Connections

- [[../Travel-Logs/_index|Travel Logs]] — Content that feeds interfaces
- [[../Occult-Studies/_index|Occult Studies]] — Symbol systems used
- [[../../_System/.aboutme|Personal Systems]] — Human Design, Gene Keys data
