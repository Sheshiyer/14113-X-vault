welcome to electron line in this video
we're going to talk about voltage what
does voltage mean well the basic concept
comes from this let's say we have a
capacitor plate set on one side we have
a positively charged capacitor plate on
the other side we have a negatively
charged capacitor plate and let's say
that they're apart a distance D from one
another we then realize there's an
electric field that exists between the
positive negative charges the electric
field will be directed from the positive
charge to the negative
charge if we now place a small charge a
positive charge on the on the right side
of this
capacitor we then realize that it's
being attracted towards the negative
charge here and being repelled by the
positive charge there so if you want to
move that charge from the right side to
the left side then it's going to require
a certain amount of work a certain
amount of force to get it there the
amount of force required is equal to the
size of that charge in kums times the
the strength of the electric field the
stronger the field the greater the
disparity of charges the more Force
you're going to need to push that charge
across the work is defined by the force
required times the distance so if we
push that charge all the way over to the
other side through a distance D the
amount of work we've done is equal to
the force time D and the force that that
charge experience is the size of the
charge time the strength of the electric
field so it's Q * Z * d That's the work
done now the definition of voltage
voltage is defined as the amount of work
done to move a charge
across this distance here where there's
an electric field the amount of work
done to do that divided by the size of
the charge that makes sense because
let's say that the charge was twice as
big let's say we have two Q
there so let's say we have twice a
charge it would then require twice the
force twice the charge therefore twice
the work and we will have twice the
charge and you see that that ratio will
always be the same regardless as to the
size of the charge that we use so it's
always the ratio of the amount of work
done divided by the charge used and
regardless how big we make that charge
that ratio is always the same and that
is then defined as the voltage is the
work done to get a charge across from
the left side to the right or from the
right side to the left side in this case
from the negative charge to the positive
charge through an electric
field divided by the charge required
if we plug in if we get rid of these
twos again right here if we plug in what
work is equal to we can see that the
work is equal to Q E * d ided by the
charge Q The Q's cancel out which means
that the voltage then is defined as to
the strength of the electric field times
the distance between the left side and
the right side of that field the voltage
can be thought of in two ways it's equal
to the amount of work we need to do to
get a charge moved through an electric
field divided by the size of the charge
or simply the potential difference or
voltage is equal to the strength of the
electric field times the
distance now a volt is defined therefore
as a jewel per Kum remember it's work
over charge work is in Jewels charge is
in kums so a volt is defined as a jewel
per Kum in other words if we have a one
Kum of
charge and it takes one Jewel of work to
get it across that means that the
voltage between those two plates is
equal to one volt that's how we want to
look at it if we have a battery and we
have a positive end of the battery and
we have a negative end of the battery
and the Volt across the battery is 10
volts we can say that the voltage at a
is 10 volts higher than the voltage at B
so sometimes we talk about potential
difference or voltage difference it is
how much more volts we have on one side
compared to the other side this case a
is 10 volt higher than than b b could be
100 volts then a would be at 110 volts
whenever we talk about the voltage of a
battery we really talk about the
difference in the voltage or the
potential difference this case when we
talk about volts from A to B that is
equal to volts at a minus volt at B
since a is bigger than b it'll be 10
volt minus 0 volt which is a 10 volt
difference but if we talk about VBA this
is equal to V at B minus V at a which is
equal to 0 Vol - 10 Vol is equal to - 10
Vol when we go from B to a we increase
in voltage by 10 volts if we go from A
to B we decrease by 10 volts that's a
negative voltage
direction another way of looking at
voltage V voltage is equal to the
potential difference potential
difference means the voltage difference
between two points on the circuit
sometimes it's also called the EMF or
the electromotive force and one of the
reasons reasons why we think about it as
the electromotive force is because
voltage is really the amount of volts
you have on a circuit or in a battery
determines how much push charges field
to move through the circuit so another
way of looking at voltage is to say that
the voltage represents the force or push
charges feel of course charges don't
really feel anything but if you think
about it if you're a charge and there's
a voltage difference there you're going
to feel a push to the circuit is going
to feel as if you're being pushed
through that circuit by the voltage
difference the bigger the voltage
difference the bigger the voltage across
that battery the more push that charge
is going to feel the greater the voltage
the greater the force that the or the
push that the that the charges feel
inside the circuit the bigger the
potential difference the greater the
force the more push to get the charges
around the circuit and that's why very
large voltages can be very dangerous
because large pushes can actually become
dangerous when get near that charges may
get push through your body if you get if
you touch a circuit and if the potential
difference of the voltage is very large
again voltage think of it as that thing
that pushes charge through circuits the
bigger the voltage the bigger the push
and that's a good place to
start
