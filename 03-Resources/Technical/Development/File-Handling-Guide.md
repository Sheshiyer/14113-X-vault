“For us to build the functionality we use, it would probably take a team of 3 or 4 developers several months. Using Uploadcare, we've basically taken a shortcut.”
Process media on the fly right before delivery time
Optimize images on our CDN before they’re sent to your app or website. Simply change URL parameters and hack away: the silicon for transformations is on us.
“I definitely believe, don’t build image-processing systems yourself. You save a tremendous amount of time.”
The infra comes with the territory
The Uploadcare Smart CDN is rock-solid and lightning-fast in both directions. Secure uploads even on spotty connections, and deliver media anywhere as if it were cached next door. With no maintenance required.
