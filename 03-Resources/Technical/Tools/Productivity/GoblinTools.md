Magic Todo acts as a standard todo list, with some special sauce. Try the
button and let it automatically come up with the steps you need to accomplish your task!
The 🌶 spiciness level 🌶 gives the tool a hint about how hard or stressful you find the task. The spicier, the more steps it will attempt to break it down into. It's not an exact measure, more a hint to the system.
Top level tasks are automatically assigned a category indicated by an emoji. You can filter your list to one or more categories with the
button. The filter button also allows you to hide all completed items.
Common task tools (edit, remove, add subtask, and estimator) are under the
button on each item. The
icon on the left can be dragged to reorder items to anywhere.
Additional actions for the entire list can be found below it. They include
synchronisation between devices,
export options , undo and redo, and
bulk actions.
