## Historical Timeline

### 1940s
- Alan Turing & Claude Shannon at Bell Labs
  > "Shannon wants to feed not just data to a brain, but cultural things! He wants to play music to it!"
- Early pattern recognition concepts
- Foundation of computational intelligence

### 1950s
- Oliver Selfridge's Pandemonium (1958)
  > "We are proposing here a model of a process which we claim can adaptively improve itself to handle certain pattern-recognition problems which cannot be adequately specified in advance."
- Development of bottom-up learning systems
- Pattern recognition frameworks

### 1960s-70s
- Jane Jacobs' Urban Emergence (1961)
  > "Under the seeming disorder of the old city... is a marvelous order for maintaining the safety of the streets and the freedom of the city."
- Warren Weaver's Organized Complexity
- Emergence of self-organizing systems theory

### 1980s-90s
- Artificial Life & Genetic Algorithms
- Jefferson & Taylor's Tracker System
  > "To our wonderment and utter joy, it succeeded the first time... It was mind-blowing."
- SimCity and emergence in popular culture

## Key Concepts Through Quotes

### Pattern Recognition
> "The system doesn't come with any predefined conceptions about the shapes of letters—you train the system to associate letters with specific shapes in the grading phase."

### Emergence Properties
> "There are no switch-flippers, no pacemakers—just a swarm of isolated cells colliding with one another, and leaving behind their pheromone footprints."

### System Evolution
> "Run through enough cycles, and you have a recipe for engineering masterworks like the human eye—without a bona fide engineer in sight."
