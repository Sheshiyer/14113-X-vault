Hello everyone and welcome to this complete Linux course. This course was previously hosted on Udemy
and I am now making it available to everyone here on YouTube. This course was
designed to be a survey of Linux, so we're gonna touch a lot of topics. This is a complete list of topics
and I will post this in the description to this video as timestamps
But we start with a general introduction to Linux. What are Linux distributions? Then we move onto installation line
and we get into command  we move into the file system,
how to create create delete and transfer files, move onto some development
some networking and general I guess Linux administrative tasks
if at any point you find yourself needing help, or you'd like some more one-on-one attention
or a tutor of sorts, I currently have a great course on Udemy
that is Linux based, its a pen testing course
I'll put a link to that course in the description, so be sure to like comment
and subscribe, and without further adue I'll turn you over to Nick who will be your instructor for this course.
