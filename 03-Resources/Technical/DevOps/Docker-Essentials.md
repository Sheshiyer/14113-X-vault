At a Glance
Learn how to use containers for your applications. Create and run your first Docker container. Then, learn how to run containers in production and solve problems of orchestration such as high availability, service discovery, and reconciliation.
About this course
Docker is a development tool and a virtualization technology used to automate the deployment of applications inside software containers. A container on the other hand is a standard way to package an application that contains all the configuration files, and other dependencies to operate the application. Containers work by isolating the application inside the container so that everything outside the container can be standardized.
Docker has provided a set of tools to simplify the use of containers. This has led to massive adoption of containers by developers and operators. In this course, you will focus mostly on Docker container technologies.
In this course, you'll follow a series of hands-on labs that demonstrate how to use containers for your applications. You'll start with the basics: creating and running your first Docker containers. By the end of the course, you'll get a brief introduction to running containers in production with the and how to solve problems of advanced orchestration such as high availability, service discovery, and reconciliation.

Final exam
Requirements
You don't need to know anything about containers to take this course, and no extensive programming experience is required. However, you must know how to run command-line tools from your workstation.
If you don't have Docker already, you need install Docker Community Edition (CE) or use the use
Play-with-Docker
for all the labs in this course. Docker installations are available from
store.docker.com
for your Mac, Windows, or Linux machine.
This course shows you how to install Docker.
You must also have a Docker Hub account to complete Lab 3. If you don't already have one, go to
Play-with-Docker
and follow the prompts to create an account.
