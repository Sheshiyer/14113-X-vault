WORLD LABS
AI Turns Photos Into 3D Real Worlds
World Labs, led by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, has revealed its
first major project
: an AI system that transforms any 2D image into an interactive 3D environment, accessible via web browsers.
Here’s what you need to know:
The system generates full 3D environments that expand beyond what’s visible in the original image, allowing users to explore new perspectives.
Users can freely navigate and view the generated space with standard keyboard and mouse controls, similar to browsing a website.
It includes real-time camera effects like depth-of-field and dolly zoom, as well as interactive lighting and animation sliders to tweak scenes.
The system works with both photos and AI-generated images, enabling creators to integrate it with text-to-image tools or even famous works of art.
Why it matters
:
This technology opens up exciting possibilities for industries like gaming, film, and virtual experiences. Soon, creating fully immersive worlds could be as simple as generating a static image.

Elon Musk vs OpenAI
Elon Musk, Shivon Zilis, and X.AI Corp. have filed an emergency court motion to prevent OpenAI’s transformation into a for-profit entity. The lawsuit accuses OpenAI, Sam Altman, and Microsoft of deviating from the nonprofit’s original mission.

OpenAI is considering adding ads
OpenAI is considering adding ads to its AI products as it explores new revenue streams to offset its $5B annual costs, despite generating $4B from subscriptions and APIs. The company has hired ad experts from Meta and Google, though CFO Sarah Friar clarified there are "no active plans" yet. While ads could ease financial pressure, they risk altering user trust and the AI experience, echoing concerns about over-commercialization seen in platforms like Google.

CHATGPT
2 years of ChatGPT
ChatGPT, launched two years ago, has quickly become the go-to generative AI bot for millions, with
200 million weekly users
, double the number from a year ago, according to OpenAI.
Here’s what you need to know:
As ChatGPT grows, rivals have surfaced, including Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama, Microsoft’s Copilot, and Perplexity’s (yep, just Perplexity). Even xAI has joined the fray with its Grok, which offers a chatbot with humor and access to X.
After being late to the AI game, Apple has integrated
ChatGPT into iOS
, iPadOS, and macOS. Siri now provides answers based on “world knowledge” rather than just personal data like your calendar or messages.
Amazon has invested
$8.25 billion
in Anthropic to enhance Alexa with a more conversational tone powered by Claude. This shows Amazon's focus on improving its AI capabilities.
Google’s dominance in search might be coming to an end after a federal ruling in August, which declared its search monopoly illegal. The DOJ is
pushing
Google to sell Chrome, which could disrupt its $2 trillion search empire.
Why it matters
:
AI competition is heating up, with Google still leading, but ChatGPT and other competitors are pushing the boundaries in various industries like search and virtual assistants. Google's search monopoly is under threat, and the upcoming shifts in AI integrations could change the landscape in the near future.
