AMAZON
Amazon develops new multi-modal AI 'Olympus'
Amazon is reportedly developing a multimodal AI model called '
Olympus
,' designed for image and video analysis, aiming to reduce the reliance on Anthropic's Claude chatbot.
Here's what you need to know:
Olympus reportedly features 2 trillion parameters, allowing it to analyze large visual content in images and videos and search for specific scenes using text prompts.
Olympus could boost customer experiences with personalized recommendations and smarter interactions across Amazon platforms.
The model has various potential applications, including sports analysis and geological inspections for energy companies.
Amazon may launch 'Olympus' as soon as next week at its annual AWS re:Invent conference, possibly via the AWS Bedrock service.
Why it matters:
The launch of ‘Olympus’ could reduce Amazon's reliance on Anthropic's Claude chatbot, giving the company more control over its multimodal AI. It also helps Amazon to counter the dominance of competitors like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAl in the Gen-Al space.

Google’s Gemini to get major upgrade for Code Analysis
Google is preparing to enhance Gemini with a feature that will allow users to upload entire code folders of up to 1,000 files and 100MB, as discovered in unreleased code. This upgrade will enable developers to query Gemini about the code’s functionality and improvements, moving beyond its current single-file limitation. The launch timeline remains unclear, and it’s uncertain whether the feature will be exclusive to premium subscribers.

xAI could launch a ChatGPT competitor in December
Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, plans to launch a standalone consumer AI application as early as December 2024. This move aims to position xAI's Grok chatbot as a direct competitor to existing AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini
ALIBABA
Alibaba takes on OpenAI's o1 with new "Reasoning" AI model
Alibaba’s Qwen team has launched
QwQ-32B-Preview
, a powerful open-source AI model with a 32,000-context window that competes directly with OpenAI’s o1 series in reasoning and math tasks.
Here's what you need to know:
Similar to OpenAI's o1 models, QwQ uses 'deep introspection' by working through problems step-by-step, questioning its own answers, and refining its reasoning to find a solution.
It surpasses OpenAI’s o1 series in key benchmark tests like AIME and MATH, excelling at advanced logical puzzles and mathematical problems.
However, the Qwen team noted that the model has limitations, such as issues with common-sense reasoning, occasional language mixing, and getting stuck in reasoning loops.
Although only some components have been released under an Apache 2.0 license, QwQ-32B is "openly" available for commercial use.
Why it matters:
QwQ is part of a growing wave of Chinese AI models challenging OpenAI's dominance in reasoning capabilities. Its release, along with
DeepSeek's system
, signals increasing global competition in AI development, especially in logical reasoning and problem-solving.
