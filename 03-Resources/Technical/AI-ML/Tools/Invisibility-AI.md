Invisibility is a great alternative to Raycast Pro. Happy they have a paid tier to fund their free offering.
Really surprised they’re able to offer all the latest premium models for free though 🤯

It's even better than the ChatGPT desktop app. Smoother experience of using LLMs without switching tabs and apps!

Invisibility is amazing. Everyone I've shared the Invisibility app with has said that it is much better than the OpenAI app.
