Winner: GPT-4o
Loser: Claude Sonnet 3.5
Reasons why Claude 3.5 lost this battle:
1. It was fast but didn't focus on design.
2. It generated rough code meant only for testing.
3. Speed doesn't equate to quality; quick delivery meant half-done work.
In contrast, GPT-4o took its time and produced a functional, aesthetically pleasing calculator.
The only change I made to the GPT-4o code was adjusting the width from 200px to 300px to improve the calculator's appearance.
Which one is better?

1. Test the prompts.
