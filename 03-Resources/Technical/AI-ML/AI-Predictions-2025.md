PREDICTIONS
12 Predictions for AI in 2025
The past year in tech has been one of steady and meaningful progress.
AI technology improved a lot, with better memory, longer attention spans, faster processing, easy access to video generation, and smarter systems overall. Other fields like self-driving cars, virtual reality, brain-computer connections, and quantum computing also took big steps forward, bringing fresh excitement to the tech world.
And as we are heading into 2025, here’s some of the predictions that I think we will see:
Google will take the lead on real-life image and video intelligence due to its vast datasets from Google Images and YouTube.
AI will start to be seriously used in AI development, starting a smaller form of recursive self-improvement, though I don't expect it to be without human intervention in 2025.
Web agents will go mainstream, becoming the next major killer application in consumer AI. Imagine a world in which your web interactions will be done by an AI web agent. Claude’s computer use and Open AI have something lined up in January.
It will become common place for all AI models to have token limits higher than 10M with the best models having near-infinite memory (i.e. in the hundreds of millions of tokens with 99.9% recall accuracy.)
The real story of 2025 won't be companies giving up on GenAI - it'll be companies finally figuring out how to use it right. (Having experimented with AI since 2022, it’s all about finding the right use case.)
AI video indistinguishable from real videos akin to current AI images + A semi-decent full-length AI-generated movie.
A somewhat playable AI video game i.e., a superior version of the diffusion-based video game we saw in the deepmind paper a few weeks back.
Self driving cars will be better than humans.
Real general intelligence won't be archived in 2025 either. It will take some time for General Intelligence in AI. AGI got captured as a marketing term by OpenAI in 2022.
Massive anti-AI sentiment spreading like wildfire.
Deepfake for both images and videos will improve massively to the point it gets impossible or really hard to distinguish.
We see some wild combinations - imagine brain-computer interfaces working alongside everyday AI tools. That's where the real magic will happen.
PS: take them with a grain of salt, folks – the future of AI is always full of surprises!

ICEBERG
The AI Iceberg of 2024
The diffusion of AI through society and the economy is like the proverbial iceberg - what we observe is merely the visible tip, while the majority remains hidden beneath the surface.
Some speculative observations:
Unofficial AI Usage
: The majority of AI utilization “at work” happens unofficially and goes unrecorded. Workers quietly and nonchalantly incorporate tools like ChatGPT into their daily workflows because it helps them do their job better and the cost can be rounded down to zero. For every worker using their company’s sanctioned and deeply integrated “copilot” there are thousands who JFDI with their own provisions.
Opaque AI Lab Developments
: Leading AI laboratories maintain secrecy around their research and development. We only know what they release, and even though the pressure to release fast is significant, there are hints that much more goes on behind closed doors. This is true even for labs releasing “open” models.
Invisible AI Content
: While poorly generated AI content is easily identifiable, high-quality AI-produced materials like text and images often goes undetected. We only notice AI's failures, not its successes. A lot more content you encounter every day is AI-generated than you might imagine.
Silent Business Integration
: Many companies integrate AI into their systems and processes without public disclosure. They do this to preserve their competitive advantage, and to avoid public criticism, sometimes justified and in other cases not, of their reliance on AI.
HUGGINGFACE
Two of the most loved Huggingface space of 2024
Kolors Virtual Try on
: It allows you to try on clothes before purchasing, ensuring a perfect fit every time.
Illusion Diffusion
: It allows you to generate stunning high quality illusion artwork.
