Khoj
is a personal AI app to extend your capabilities. It smoothly scales up from an on-device personal AI to a cloud-scale enterprise AI.
Chat with any local or online LLM (e.g llama3, qwen, gemma, mistral, gpt, claude, gemini).
Get answers from the internet and your docs (including image, pdf, markdown, org-mode, word, notion files).
Access it from your Browser, Obsidian, Emacs, Desktop, Phone or Whatsapp.
Create agents with custom knowledge, persona, chat model and tools to take on any role.
Automate away repetitive research. Get personal newsletters and smart notifications delivered to your inbox.
Find relevant docs quickly and easily using our advanced semantic search.
Generate images, talk out loud, play your messages.
Khoj is open-source, self-hostable. Always.
