OpenAI has made its
Canvas feature
available to all ChatGPT users, moving it from its previous exclusive status for paid subscribers. This update, announced during the "12 Days of OpenAI" live stream, brings a more dynamic and efficient interface for content creation and editing.
What is Canvas?
Canvas transforms ChatGPT into a dual-pane layout:
Left Sidebar: The traditional conversation with ChatGPT.
Right Workspace: Real-time editing of your content, where changes are instantly reflected.
Canvas, integrated with GPT-4, offers the following:
Writing: Suggest edits, adjust length, change reading level, and add emojis for emphasis.
Coding: Add logs, fix bugs, port code to different languages, and review code for improvements.
Real-Time Editing: Edit text or code directly with instant feedback.
Python Code Execution: Execute and debug Python code, with automatic suggestions for fixes.
Custom GPT Integration: Default for custom GPTs, with the option to toggle on or off.
Why it matters:
This update takes ChatGPT to the next level by streamlining workflows and making content creation, data analysis, and code experimentation smoother and more efficient. With real-time feedback and quick edits, Canvas enhances both productivity and creativity, appealing to everyone from hobbyists to professionals.

Google doesn't know how to differentiate between AI and non-AI content.
Ryan Darani  @SearchForRyan
"'ai content doesn't work"
translation:
- 'i spent 5 minutes writing bad prompts
- got garbage output
- gave up
- blamed the tools
me:
- 3 months learning prompting
- 300 hours testing
- human-like quality at scale
I can compete with any content agency
