OpenAI is on the cusp of unveiling an enhanced version of its Sora video generator, integrating sophisticated capabilities like text-to-video, text-and-image-to-video, and text-and-video-to-video generation, accommodating clips up to one minute in duration.
Here’s what you need to know:
OpenAI’s
Chad Nelson
revealed these details during the C21Media event in London, corroborated by recent API leaks indicating a faster, more efficient design.
The new
OpenAI page
currently lists Sora availability by country. We can assume it's coming to ChatGPT very soon.
The rollout, potentially aligned with OpenAI’s winter event, could also introduce GPT-4.5 and advanced image-generation updates for GPT-4o.
The API leak suggests that the updated version offers a faster, more efficient design, which could make video creation quicker and more accessible for creators.
Competition is growing in text-to-video AI:
OpenAI is not alone in the text-to-video space. Tencent recently introduced
Hunyuan-Video
, which outperforms rivals like Gen3 and Luma while being fully open-source. Meanwhile, Google has launched
Veo
, a tool that generates high-quality, high-definition videos based on text or image prompts in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles, all with exceptional speed.

OpenAI employee claims AGI is here (sort of)
According to OpenAI’s Vahid Kazemi, their O1 model might meet the broad definition of AGI: “better than most humans at most tasks.” However, critics argue that AGI requires more than efficiency, it needs true agency and self-modifying capabilities to adapt to diverse environments. Some point to
advancements
like Boston Dynamic’s Atlas, which demonstrates autonomy in workflows, as evidence we’re nearing AGI.

The end of the GPT era: The rise of Reasoning Models
The GPT era is evolving. While GPT models excel at text prediction, newer models like OpenAI's o1 focus on reasoning rather than mere predictions. O1 simulates independent thinking by exploring multiple possibilities before answering. Although promising, O1 still requires significant resources and faces challenges in proving its capabilities. Companies like Google and Anthropic are also advancing in this space, signaling a shift toward AI systems that aim to move beyond simple pattern recognition.

Meta launches leaner, efficient Llama 3.3
Meta’s Llama 3.3 is a leaner, meaner version of its predecessor, packing the punch of a 405-billion-parameter model into a far more efficient 70 billion parameters. This upgrade slashes GPU memory needs—up to 24 times less load for the same performance—making it a cost-effective choice for developers.

Run Llama 3.1 1B offline at 60+ tok/s. Entirely on your phone.
Siri can’t save you offline, but a local model just might.
