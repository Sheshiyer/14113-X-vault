Google is stepping into the AI agents era with the launch of
Gemini 2.0
, an upgraded AI chatbot, and a limited rollout of
Project Astra
, a computer vision-powered AI agent.
Here’s what’s new:
Gemini 2.0
:
Better at
reasoning
.
Faster responses.
More efficient at handling general questions, coding, and math.
Gemini 2.0 is available now as
Gemini 2.0 Flash
for users, while a more advanced version will be accessible in
early 2025
.

Google just launched an AI that takes over Chrome and does things for you.
It scores an insane 90.5% w/ tree search on the WebVoyager benchmark which has tasks like:
"Book a flight from SF to Berlin, departing on March 5 and returning on the 12"
Agents are going mainstream.

An experimental
new Chrome extension
that can quite literally use your web browser for you.
Great for analyzing text, images, and graphs.
Still in testing, with issues in accuracy and speed.
Google is also exploring Gemini 2.0 role in gaming, collaborating with Supercell to assist players with game-related queries.

Why it matters:
This won’t shock you, but Google’s plan for Gemini 2.0 is to use it absolutely everywhere. It will power AI Overviews in Google Search, which Google says now reach 1 billion people and which the company says will now be more nuanced and complex thanks to Gemini 2.0. It’ll be in the Gemini bot and app, of course, and will eventually power the AI features in Workspace and elsewhere at Google.

Why it's time to get optimistic about Self-Driving cars
The self-driving car industry is making significant strides, particularly with robotaxis gaining traction. Improved overlapping technologies, public acceptance, and a supportive regulatory environment are key factors accelerating adoption. While consumer-level self-driving cars are still years away from mass adoption, the technology's progress is undeniable, and optimism about its future is growing.

Google built an AI tool that can do research for you
(Image credit: Google)
Google has upgraded its Gemini chatbot with a new feature called
Deep Research
, which uses advanced reasoning to conduct in-depth research and compile comprehensive reports. It automates the research process by analyzing information from the web, creating a multi-step plan, and refining the analysis over time.
Here’s how it works:
Users can input research questions and review an
AI-generated research
plan before execution
The system spends several minutes browsing the web, mimicking human research patterns
Results are compiled into a comprehensive report with source links for further exploration
Users can refine results through follow-up questions and export final reports to
Google Docs
While Deep Research represents a significant step forward in AI-assisted research tools, its effectiveness in real-world applications and potential impact on information gathering practices remains to be seen, particularly as users begin to integrate it into their workflow and Google continues to refine the technology based on user feedback.

The new Devin is the 1st AI product that feels like a legitimate teammate.
I can reliably give it tasks that I’d expect a junior engineer to complete.
Assign it a task, walk away, and it gets done.
It is *way* better than the old version.
