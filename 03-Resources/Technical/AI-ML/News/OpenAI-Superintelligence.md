SUPERINTELLIGENCE
OpenAI Moves Beyond AGI Toward Superintelligence
In a recent
blog post
, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, announced a bold new direction: the company is shifting its focus from Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to the pursuit of "superintelligence."
Here's what you need to know:
Altman believes that these advanced AI systems will accelerate scientific discovery and innovation at an unprecedented pace, far surpassing human capabilities and fostering societal wealth and prosperity.
He hinted that AI-powered agents could soon join the workforce, significantly boosting productivity, potentially as early as this year.
Despite this vision, AI still faces significant challenges, including "hallucinations" (AI errors), mistakes, and the high cost of operations. However, Altman is optimistic about overcoming these hurdles.
With
multiple departures
from safety-focused teams, the question of "how to safely control superintelligent systems" remains unresolved. The recent departure of key figures, including those leading AI ethics teams, raises red flags about the path OpenAI is taking.
Why it matters:
OpenAI's move towards superintelligence could drastically change industries, potentially accelerating progress far beyond current human capabilities. Labor markets, job displacement, and societal structures will likely undergo significant changes, but it also raises critical concerns about safety and control that need to be addressed.

Humanoid robots are joining car assembly lines
By 2026, GAC will roll out GoMate, a humanoid robot designed for car assembly lines. This robot has 38 degrees of freedom and hands that are flexible enough to do delicate tasks. It can even climb stairs and is super energy-efficient, using solid-state batteries that save up to 80% of the energy a regular robot would use. BMW’s already doing something similar, so this is a trend we’ll see more of in the future.

Microsoft announces $80B AI investment plan for 2025
Microsoft just announced a bold $80 billion investment for AI in FY 2025. This plan focuses on building out AI-powered data centers and supporting global AI projects, especially in the U.S. A big chunk of this investment will go toward training 2.5 million Americans in AI skills. With Meta, Google, and Amazon all ramping up their AI investments, it’s clear that the competition in AI is about to get intense.

Hugging Face Unveils Smolagents
Hugging Face has released
Smolagents
, a minimalist open-source framework that allows developers to build powerful AI agents quickly using just three lines of Python code.
Here's what you need to know:
It leverages Hugging Face's
extensive library
of pre-trained models, allowing the creation of agents capable of understanding commands, connecting to external data sources, and dynamically generating and executing code.
Smolagents is lightweight, containing only about 1,000 lines of code. This makes it simple to use while still handling the complexity of building AI agents.
Its standout feature, CodeAgent, allows the AI to write Python code directly rather than using traditional toolcalling methods, reducing steps by 30%.
This framework is compatible with multiple models, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta's Llama, and Qwen, giving developers access to a broad range of tools.
Why it matters:
SmolAgents makes building AI agents easier for everyone, from beginners to experienced developers. Its simple design and powerful features let you quickly turn ideas into working solutions without extensive resources, making it a great option for solo developers and small teams.
For a visual overview and tutorial on Smolagents, you might find the following video helpful:

It’s been a mini-game on image-based social media for the past year or 2, guessing if people are AI or not. There’s been many convincing ones I've noticed. But it’s also been clear that the game would end, it seems like it ends here in 2025.

What is interesting to an AI agent?
The idea of using multiple specialized models encourages a modular approach to intelligence, allowing for the integration of diverse skills and knowledge, which can lead to more robust problem-solving capabilities.

Best way to copy a website:
1. Take a screenshot
2. Ask Claude 3.5 Sonnet to explain the design in detail.
3. Pro tip: Ask Sonnet to give you the answer in .json format.
4. Give it to @stackblitz's @boltdotnew

Copying websites is getting too easy with AI tools like Bolt. But I guess getting inspired is better than copying everything from someone’s website.
