during the weekend I buil a group of
research gpts where I can pass on a link
of air table that contain a list of
different research objects and they will
be able to extract data from the air
table research together and F in the
results back to air table for me behind
the scenes there is swamp of different
gpts working together from breaking down
the big research goal into prioritize
list to actually browsing internet CRI
tiet results to produce high quality
research and what's more exciting is
that you can actually expand this system
to more and more different working
groups to expand its ability further if
you want and I want to show you step by
step how I did it if you watch my videos
before you probably know I'm very
passionate about building an AI
researcher because research is such a
foundamental ability that AI can do and
has a wide range of use case scenario
and for the past 6 months the AI
development has been so crative that
every two months I re build a new AI
researcher with a lot of new
capabilities delivering higher and
higher quality quity research back may
2023 it a simple lar language model
chain that follow a very linear process
it is basically a function that can take
in a research topic triggering the
Google research and let large language
model to choose which links are most
relevant and scripting the website and
in the end get large langage model to
generate a report I can type in topic of
Twitter threat I want to write and it
will do the research and generate a Str
based on those information collected so
even though it works but it is really
linear flow for example if the new
reference information found from the
content script it won't be able to
research further so it is only good for
very obvious simple research tasks but
two months later AI agent became a part
topic and if you don't know what AI
agent is it is combination of large
language model memory and tools so it
can do the reasoning to break down a big
goal into sub tasks and also have access
to different tools like Google search
API to actually complete those tasks and
also have long-term memory to remember
what he did before and one of the most
fundamental difference is that AI agent
is more goal oriented so you can give a
fairly ambiguous goal like research
facts about what happened to Sam it is
able to take multiple different actions
to complete this goal so very quickly I
build a second version of research agent
where I give a special system prompt as
well as access to basic tools like
Google search and scripting and the
quality of research result is a lot
higher it is able to continuously
navigating through the internet find
more and more reference articles until
point that it feels that it gots enough
information and complet the tasks I can
just give it ambiguous research go and
it is able to return a high quality
research results as well as a list of
different reference links so it was a
huge step forward compared with this
first version of AI researcher but also
has problems the biggest one is the
quality is not consistent sometime it
deliver awesome research results on the
other hand it can't really handle
complex or constraint actions that open
AI didn't really want it to do so if I
wanted to research about the phone
number or email address about a specific
perspect it kind of refused to do so so
in summary it is great for a list of
different tasks but the quality is not
assured but after a few months a few
multi-agent systems emerged like M gbt
and Chad def it allowed the system to
tackle more complex tasks they try to
improve the task performance by
introducing not only one but multiple
agents working together and the recent
Frameworks like autogen made the
creation of those system even easier and
it is very flexible to create all sorts
of different hierarchy and structure to
orchestrate the collaboration between
different agents and as open AI released
assistant API and GBS the cost of
building useful agents has significantly
dropped so this got me thinking why
can't I create AI researcher 3.0 where I
can have the original researcher to
still doing the research but introduce a
research manager to critique and do the
quality control to making sure the
result is always aligned with what user
want and what's cooler is I can even
introduce more and more agents into this
assistant for example I can introduce
another research director who can break
down a large research goal into subtasks
and delegate to both research manager
and researchers and even do more tasks
like reading and writing to a air table
to save all the research results while
the research team will be still focusing
on doing the actual research and the
result is the research quality is a lot
more consistent and system becomes a lot
more autonomous as well as all those
little agents just doing the quality
assurance with each other this represent
paradigm shift about what people think
of AGI at earlier this year when we talk
about AGI often we have this image where
this one AI can do all sorts of
different things then the word might
just have one AI that operates
everything but there are lots of
different technical challenges to get
this work but on the other side the
sentiment now is whether we can create
lots of different agents who are
specialized in specific task but figure
out framework that let them collaborate
towards a share goal but how do you
train highly specialized agent well
there are two common ways you can either
do fine-tuning or you can create
knowledge base which is what people
normally call Rock retrieval augmented
generation and they kind of serve
different purpose rag is mainly used
when you want to give large Lage model
very accurate and rant data like get the
most up to- dat stock information but if
your goal is to improve the model skills
in performing specific task like data
categorization or answering customer
email in specific style that's the time
you want to try fine tuning but here's
one problem fine tuning of high
performance opens Source model is
difficult and requires specialized
Hardware with big memory capacity and
Grading AI is a platform that really
reduce barrier for fine tuning they make
fine-tuning and influence open source
model extremely simple and accessible to
all developers and Enterprise with just
few lines code you can find two model
like llama 2 nors hermis and others you
can also choose the programming language
of your preference either nodejs python
or command line interface and they
provide all the tools and tutorials
needed so you can get start very easily
and the best is their pricing model
normally for fine tuni you will have to
pay all the upfront cost for dedicated
infrastructure and Computing unit but
gradient remove the need for the
infrastructure and you only pay for what
you use by token if you click on the
link in the description below you will
get $5 free credits to Stars so if you
ever have needs to find your model but
don't know how to start I definitely
recommend to give a try and now back to
our research agents I'm going to show
you how can you build this multi agent
research system step by step let's get
it so the way we will Buu this system is
our first it creat three different GPT
assistants with different roles director
research manager and research agent and
each one of them play different role
where director will be able to read and
update air table database and also break
down research task and delegate to
research manager and researchers where
the research manager will generate an
actual research plan for a given topic
and review and do the quality assurance
for the actual research delivered by res
Searcher and we're use autogen as a
framework to oxr those collaborations
and one good thing about using autogen
is they actually simplify how to use
assistant API because assistant API
actually structure in a way that you
have to create Strat send message wait
and continuously check the progress to
use that you normally need to create a
function like this where it will create
a run the Strat message first and write
a function to continuously check the
progress until you get progress like
requir action to ask for user
confirmation or send back reads but with
Auto is pretty straightforward you can
use a GPT assistant agent and just
trigger message like normal so let's
firstly create assistant open AI
playground so I'll create a research
agent first which agent that actually
going to browse the internet and do the
task so I'll given name special
instructions your worldclass researcher
who do detailed research on any topic
and produce fact-based results you do
not make things up and you should do
enough research to gather as much
information as possible if there are URL
or relevant links and articles you will
script it to get more information after
each scripting and search you should
think is there any other new things that
I should search and script based on the
data I have now but don't do this more
than three iterations you should not
make things up and in the final output
it should include the research reference
link as well and do not include a
website like G2 LinkedIn because those S
sometimes are gated or the quality or
the content quality is not great I
choose GPD for Turbo and then add two
different function callings inside this
is schema the name is Google search
description and the input will be Search
keywords and it is required the other is
website scripting it would have two
inputs one is the URL of the website
that it should script another is
objective which is the goal of scripting
website because for scripting I will
actually trigger a summary chain so I
want a large Lage model to know what are
the goal of This research so that they
can summarize content in a way that then
lose those details and the required is
URL and objective and here I just turn
on code interpreter in case you need to
do some further data analyst and once
you finish you can try it out let's say
research about pricing model for
relevance a a i and click add R so you
can say it do a Google search first the
Search keywords is ROM than sayi pricing
model let's say I return example results
of this URL then it will try to do the
website scripting with this URL and also
the objective extract detail information
about pricing model including any tier
rat or specific service feature included
each price point so this is pretty good
the next thing is our created research
manager given name and also this special
prompt so you are a research manager
you're are harsh and relentless your
firstly try to generate two actions the
researcher can take to find information
needed try to avoid websites that don't
allow scraping and you review the
results from researcher and always push
back if the researcher didn't find the
information be persistent say no you
have to find the information try again
and propose one next method to try if
the research want to get away only after
researcher found the information needed
he will say terminate so this a
researcher manager will basically play
the role of quality control and making
sure the researcher tried everything
possible to find the information and
click save and the last one is director
and I will give you a special system
prompt you are the director of research
company you will extract list of
companies to research from Air table and
break it down into individual research
task for each research task you will
delegate to research manager and Market
researcher to complete a task once a
company's research is completed you will
updated company information individually
to air table and only say terminate
after you update all the records in air
table with information collected and it
will have two different functions one is
get air table records which will be used
to read existing data on a from a air
table URL and it has a few inputs base
ID and table ID and the other is update
single and the other is update single
air table record it has other inputs
base ID table ID as well as ID of the
specific rode that I need to update and
the data that to be updated and again I
can test this one as well so I copy this
link research the pricing model of each
company in the list list so it will try
to trigger the air table records with
the exact base ID and table ID and let's
say this is a list of Records in return
and click submit then it will read the
result and break down into different
research task and delegate to research
manager and Market researcher and let's
say it Returns the research results and
boom it trigger four different update
single air table records so this is new
parallel multi-function ability that
open a I just introduced and as you can
see it gets inputs all correctly so this
is working well as well so now we get
both stre assistant set up we just need
to connect them together in autogen so I
will open the visual studio code and
firstly let's create new file called oei
config list this is where your inst open
AI API key putting array as well as a
model and next let's create aemv file so
this is where we store API key for other
service like browser L and serer which
is the one we're going to use for Google
search and web scripting and also put
open AI here that's because I actually
want to use l chain summarized chain
later to summarize content that agent
script from website all right and next
we will create app.py and first they
import list of different libraries that
we're going to use and also load
environment and config list and now
let's have overview about what we're
going to create so we'll create a list
of functions that we're going to use
from website scripting Google search get
and update air table records as well as
four different agents we're going to
create from user proxy agent researcher
research manager and director and we're
going to put them together into a group
chat in the end start a conversation and
firstly let's create a function for
Google search and here we're going to
use service called serer to get Google
search results so give a URL keywords
the API key and do a post request and
next is function for website scripting
and we will have two function one is the
website scripting and summary function
will be used if the content is too long
so that we don't blow up agents memory
and under the web scraping we're passing
on two input objective and URL putting
the header and data which is URL that we
want to script and convert it to Json
string so that we can pass on to the API
request Quest and here we are using
browser L which is website scraping
service but for more sophiscated
scraping Behavior you can also use API
file or rapid API where they provide
wide range of data access so I press on
URL header and data and if we get
response back and then we will try to
extract Tex content from the website and
if the lens is more than 10,000
character then we will do a summary
otherwise it will just return the text
and for summary function we're going to
summarize it through a ling summary
chain so I create large Dage model use
text splitter to split the large content
into small chunks with each chunk size
10,000 and I'm going to create list of
documents from the split text and here I
will give it a prompt write a summary of
the following text for this specific
objective and here a summary and I will
create a map prompt template and use l
chain low summarize chain so what this
does is it basically try to make a
summary of each chunk and in the end try
to combine them together and then outp
put final summary so those are all the
function that we need for the research
agent and then I move down here to
define the user proxy agent and research
agent to start test so first they create
user proxy agent if you're not familiar
with autogen user proxy agent is
basically agent that can execute code or
give feedback to other agents on behalf
of user and I will putu human input mode
to be always so that I will always have
chance to give feedback and next is we
will create a researcher agent so our
Define researcher agent equal to GPT
assistant agent give name and researcher
and inside lar langage model config I
pass on the assistant ID and assistant
ID is the one that I will get from the
open AI playground also registered
functions so web scripting function will
be point to the web scripting function
that we create above same thing for
Google search so that's pretty much it
it's super easy to set up and I can
quickly test it out user proxy agent
initial a CH research with the pricing
of random Ai and our open Terminal try
to run this and one thing to know is to
run GPT assistant in Auto gen you have
to install this specific version of
autogen
0.2.0 B5 so making sure you install this
first and then let's run python app.py
so you can see the user proxy agent
trigger message what's surprising then
the researcher execute the Google search
function and also start sripping and
great so it return the results with all
different tiers okay great so that means
we successfully set up autogen with GPT
assistance now we just need to bring
more agents so I'll create a research
manager agent same thing I'll go back to
open AI copy the assistant ID and pting
here so research manager agent is also
ready and this research manager agent
will review and critique the result from
researcher which in series should really
improve the quality of research so let's
try out I'll quickly create a group chat
with user proxy agent researcher and
research manager and I trigger message
to the group chat manager why Sam timman
was fired so you can see it trigger
message to chat manager and the
researcher start browsing the internet
and get information and here is the
initial report there's some issues
scripting the content from website
however Sam atomus departure from open I
follow with review process by the board
which conclude that he was not
consistently transparent in his
communication with the board leading to
the board lost confidence in his ability
to lead the company and this pretty much
this is fine but it's not great it's
very like surface level information but
then you can see the research manager he
said no you have to find information try
again there could be confusion or
misinformation around this topic so
first say check official press release
or statement from open AI or Sam optiman
himself and then look for credible new
source or technology focused
Publications so this is great it will
force the researcher to do more research
and also give advice about where to look
and now the researcher coming back with
more more and better details which is
great so the last thing I want to do is
I'll create director agent we should be
able to access any air table link I have
and conduct multiple different research
actions and few information back so I
will firstly move up to create a
function for air table and we're use air
table API and point and to do that you
need to go to air table SLC create SL
tokens to create a new token give a name
and also add a scope which should both
read and write permission and once it
finish you should come back Tov file and
include air table API key here as well
so our first create function forget a
table records so it will pass on base ID
and table ID base ID is basically this
part of the URL and table ID is this
part of the URL and second is we will
create a function for update single air
table record where it will pass on API
key and data will be records the ID of
the row and also the fuse to update it
will be a patch request call and that's
pretty much it I'll move down to the
create director agent our Define
director agent with the specific
assistant ID and also register the two
functions for read and write at table in
the end I will add director into the
group chat so this you can see how easy
it is to continue expanding this swamps
so to continue expand the swamp of
agents and our add a new message
research the pricing for each company in
the list with this air table so I'll
trigger this message so you can see the
director use the function to actually
get the list of records from Air table
and then create a message to research
for each company uh it does hallucinate
a little bit um probably to change the
system prom a little bit now it is try
to be creative and hallucinate about the
different research manager it has and
then the researcher start doing
different type of Google search doing
different different Google search and as
you can see here it is triggering
multiple search function at the same
time and here are also update the system
prompt for director agent as well so one
thing I want to make it to do is making
sure dat get task one by one do not
delegate all task at once and after each
research you have to update the research
result individually to air table and
then move on dedicate next research
topic and the reason I do this is
because the agent didn't have unlimited
memory at this point and I notice that
when there are a lot of items the agent
can trigger a lot of different Google
search at same time which actually
reduce the research quality so I want to
making sure the agent actually runs to
research one by one and our give message
research the funding stage amount and
pricing for each company in the list and
I'll open this to python app.py so you
can see it Tred to GA records from Air
table and then it says the first company
to research is this one and the
researcher start doing the research and
the researcher has returned results
about funding stage but it didn't really
find the pricing so research manager
push back and then say you can check the
official Channel as well as second
resource so the so researcher actually
start doing more research and at second
try is successfully get the pricing
information as well and on the right you
can see it automatically adding this
information and then it start delegated
for the next research topic which is
ROMs Ai and you also get information for
random AI to then move on to the last
one stack Ai and eventually finish all
the research and this is a pretty short
list but you can imagine creating list
of hundreds of research topics and this
research team can just autonomously
running for a while until they feel in
the information for every single row
there's still quite a bit problem is and
there are still quite a bit problems the
biggest one is memory because during the
research stage there are quite a lot of
information with script and often the
researcher can forget the information he
found before but there are ways you can
customize that as well so autogen
provide you ability to fully customize
the group chat flow so you can even set
up two teams with agent one should only
have memory for certain information
Agent B holds TRS about specific
information so this is probably a good
way to control the amount of memory for
each agent and in my specific case the
director probably should only know the
final research output from the research
manager instead of saying the whole
conversation chain but the result is
already pretty stunning I imagine this
research agent can be used for sales and
VC who want to do a lot of leads
qualification so that's it for the AI
researcher 3.0 it is really powerful and
the only thing to be aware is that this
can actually cost a lot of money so
making sure you monitor your open AI bu
and this is just one example as I
mentioned you can actually create all
sorts different hierarchy and
collaboration workflow so I'm very
excited to see those fully autonomous
agent teams that you start building if

you next time
