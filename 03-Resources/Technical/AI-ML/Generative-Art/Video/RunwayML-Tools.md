Mind blown. 🤯 Future of AR/Machine Learning on Art and Film is boundless...
Makes playing with machine learning so easy and fun, even on a wimpy laptop.
I made @waxy, @xoxo, @upcomingorg, http://belong.io, @playfic, @supercutorg. Helped build @kickstarter.
I love @runwayml and need to get back to playing with it...
It really is machine learning for creatives. So much potential.
In every single workshop people go crazy over runway and how accessible machine learning can be ❤️.
So far, @runwayml is probably the best tool for ML I’ve ever used. Its simplicity is elegant and refined.
Amazing what you can create with zero lines of codes. This really enables creatives to use AI. We have come a long way.
