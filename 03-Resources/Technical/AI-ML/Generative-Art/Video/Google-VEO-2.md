Google unveils VEO 2 to rival OpenAI's Sora
(Video generated by Google Veo 2)
Google just launched
Veo 2
, its new AI-powered video generator on the VideoFX platform. It promises to deliver more realistic videos with a better understanding of physics and human movement. Google says it beats competitors like Sora when it comes to quality and precision.
Here's what you need to know:
You can create high-res videos with specific filmmaking instructions, like lens types and camera effects.
Unlike earlier models that only did short clips, this one can generate videos that last several minutes.
Google’s SynthID watermark helps identify AI-generated content.
There are fewer weird glitches, like extra fingers or random objects, and it does a better job of representing real-world physics.
It outperforms competitors like OpenAI’s Sora Turbo in video quality and accuracy, based on tests using 1,003 prompts from Meta’s MovieGenBench dataset.
Other cool stuff Google is releasing:
Imagen 3 Upgrade
: Creates more vibrant, detailed images with better colors and textures. It can handle everything from photorealism to abstract art.
Whisk Experimental Tool
: Lets you generate AI images by uploading pictures instead of text. You can also mix and match images to create unique themes and scenes.
Any other tools similar to VEO 2?
Pika Labs has recently launched
version 2.0 of its AI video generator
, introducing a new feature called "Scene Ingredients" that lets users integrate their own images into AI-generated videos alongside improved motion, prompting, and animation features.
