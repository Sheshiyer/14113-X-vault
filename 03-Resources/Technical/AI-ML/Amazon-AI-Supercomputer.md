AI Agent that turns internet into a giant excel sheet
Introducing Exa Websets - A breakthrough toward perfect search
Exa, a promising startup led by Will Bryk, is set to revolutionize the way we search the web with its new AI-powered search engine,
Websets
.
Here's what you need to know:
Unlike traditional search engines that rely on keywords to index pages, Websets uses AI-powered embeddings to grasp the full context and meaning of each page. This enables more precise search results based on intent, not just matching terms.
Exa has processed 1 billion web pages, focusing on deep content understanding rather than indexing massive quantities, like Google’s trillion-page approach.
Websets is built for those searching for highly specific data—whether it’s companies, people, or niche datasets that traditional search engines struggle to find. For instance, if you're searching for software engineers based in the Bay Area who've worked at both startups and big tech companies, Websets will provide
a detailed list of relevant companies
, not just links that mention those terms.
Imagine searching for a highly specific product, like a USB-C hub with five ports, DisplayPort 1.4, and Ethernet. Instead of sifting through endless, irrelevant Google results, Websets instantly brings you exactly what you're looking for.
Why it matters:
In short, Websets takes web semantics to a new level, transforming public web pages into AI-driven databases that make finding what you need faster, more precise, and more intuitive.
