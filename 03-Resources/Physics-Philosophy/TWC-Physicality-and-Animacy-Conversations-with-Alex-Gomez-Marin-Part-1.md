# Physicality and Animacy; Conversations with Alex Gomez-Marin Part 1

## Summary

The first conversation between Killian and physicist Alex Gomez-Marin explores the intersection of physics and philosophy, centering on Bergson's critique of Einstein's spatialization of time, the metaphysics of gravity, and the possibility of a vitalistic/animistic reinterpretation of fundamental physics. They discuss how physics has developed a quasi-religious character that seals off philosophical critique, the Michelson-Morley experiment and whether the ether was prematurely discarded, and the alchemical archetype of Saturn as ontological inertia. The dialogue proposes that physics may be a particular case of biology rather than the reverse.

## Key Insights

1. **Bergson vs. Einstein -- who gets to say what time is**: Einstein dismissed Bergson's duration with "the time of philosophers does not exist; what exists is what clocks measure." This political question of authority recurs in neuroscience ("mind is what brain scans measure"), conflating method with metaphysics.

2. **Gravity as ontological rushing**: Through an alchemical/Schelling lens, gravity is contractive force that rushes the collapse of the possible into the actual. Gravitational time dilation literally means concretization happens faster under gravitational influence -- connecting Saturn (gravity, lead, time) to alchemical traditions.

3. **The ether as relational possibility**: Rather than a fixed background medium, the ether could consist of relational possibilities between entities -- fields of real possible interactions (Whiteheadian conceptual prehensions). This would explain the Michelson-Morley null result: the ether moves with entities rather than being a static backdrop.

4. **Physics as a particular case of biology**: Inverting the reductionist hierarchy (biology as applied chemistry as applied physics), Whitehead's dictum that "biology is the study of larger organisms, physics the study of smaller organisms" suggests animistic ontology as more fundamental.

5. **Multiple modes of being real**: The virtual/possible realm is not merely a calculational trick but an ontological mode. Bergson and Deleuze's virtual, Whitehead's potentiality, and quantum superposition all point to a reality with multiple provinces that cannot be collapsed into actualism alone.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Symbolism as isomorphism**: Symbolic thinking is not merely metaphorical but detects real structural self-similarities (fractals) across nature -- polarity in circuits mirrors sexual dimorphism; inertia mirrors homeostasis mirrors psychological habit.
- **Science as quasi-religion**: Physics' priestly character, the function of "impossibilities" (black holes, singularities) as quasi-sacred mysteries that seal off critique, and the Galilean-Catholic lineage of universalism through secular humanism.
- **Hermetic principle**: "As above, so below" -- the effort to transit between domains (physics, biology, consciousness, ecology) using homologous concepts rather than mathematical reduction alone.
- **The virtual and precognition**: Parapsychological phenomena like precognition may be explained through the field of real possibilities -- the future as a biased realm of potentiality accessible to consciousness.

## Transcript Excerpt

> all right there we go all right so uh Alex yeah welcome uh to to the form Escape so uh yeah we were going to talk about uh really just physics in general uh we we don't have an exact game plan here but I really wanted to touch upon some ideas pertaining to time and gravity and light so um I kind of wanted to kick this off by uh bring bringing up bergson's ideas about time in particular here um and maybe whiteheads uh as well...
