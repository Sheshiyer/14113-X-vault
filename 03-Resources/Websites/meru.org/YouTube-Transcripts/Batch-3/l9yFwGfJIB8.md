[01:00] I want to say how glad we are to have
[01:01] Stan ton here he uh we haven't seen him
[01:05] half enough this year and we're very
[01:08] much interested in what he has to say
[01:11] the alphabet of course is interesting
[01:13] and all he always is interesting so I'm
[01:16] very happy to introduce
[01:18] Stant uh I guess you know he is a
[01:21] research manager of the U miru
[01:25] foundation
[01:27] and wonderful thinker thank you thank
[01:30] you
[01:32] Ruth thank you all for coming um as Ruth
[01:35] mentioned uh I'm the director of
[01:37] research for the meru foundation and um
[01:40] this is I guess one of a continuing
[01:43] series of discussions of the work that
[01:46] we've been doing on the Hebrew alphabet
[01:48] and the text of Genesis in the Hebrew
[01:50] Bible um I'm going to review quickly the
[01:54] early work at after we get into things
[01:57] so for people who haven't seen any of
[01:58] this before I'll try to go through
[01:59] through it pretty quickly and then um I
[02:02] have a whole list of things that I'm
[02:03] going to try to accomplish there's no
[02:05] chance that we'll do them all um but I
[02:07] want to reserve two chunks of time one
[02:11] to very carefully go through the meaning
[02:13] of the Hebrew letters and as you'll see
[02:16] the hand gestures that we're saying
[02:18] appear to generate the Hebrew letters
[02:20] and then I also because this is such a
[02:22] good audience usually I'd really like to
[02:24] leave time to do some questions and to
[02:25] get into some of the philosophical
[02:27] issues and some of the implications of
[02:28] the work
[02:31] um I think what I'd like to do rather
[02:32] than continue for those who haven't
[02:34] heard this before um is to review the
[02:36] basic ideas where from which all this
[02:39] came and I'm going to do that by just
[02:41] starting at the beginning and going very
[02:42] quickly because most people here I think
[02:44] have seen
[02:46] it if you look at the first verse of the
[02:48] Hebrew text Genesis if I can get the
[02:50] light to not make Shadow for me here's
[02:53] the first verse of Genesis in
[02:56] Hebrew and what you find is if you count
[02:59] the letters in base 3 count and there's
[03:02] a paper in the pack that you've got that
[03:03] describes this in more detail you find
[03:06] that that there are sets of letters that
[03:08] are Mirror Image locations this is in in
[03:10] base three this is the 2011th letter
[03:12] this is the 102th letter you can
[03:14] consider those cartisian
[03:16] coordinates and you could put the
[03:18] letters on a rubic cube if I don't twist
[03:20] the cube it'll actually lined up
[03:22] properly and the letters that have these
[03:23] Mirror Image counts to them are in
[03:25] mirror positions on the cube and so the
[03:28] L and the r the 2011 and the 2011 and
[03:31] the 102 are mirror positions against the
[03:33] main diagonal of the cube and so there's
[03:36] something about L's and L's and rs to
[03:39] use the English equivalent names and T's
[03:42] and Fs and E's and M's and B's and eyes
[03:47] if I might I'm not only I'm not always
[03:49] using the phonetic equivalent I'm using
[03:51] a different system that enables you to
[03:53] associate them and when you do you find
[03:55] all of this is the first letter of the
[03:57] text of Genesis so this is the first use
[03:59] of any letter as you go along all of
[04:01] these letters in these sets are
[04:03] introduced in the same order r r LR TT f
[04:09] t e e m and this group is reversed
[04:12] because it's strung between the front
[04:14] and the end of the verse it's flipped
[04:16] over and you also find and I'm not going
[04:18] to go into a lot of detail here but I
[04:20] wanted you to have the paper these are
[04:21] draft
[04:22] papers that this this this paper that
[04:25] you should have a copy of here
[04:28] someplace um what you find is that you
[04:30] can use these groups these triplet
[04:32] groups and you can write the first verse
[04:35] of Genesis out on a bead
[04:37] string on a bead chain write each letter
[04:40] on a bead and curl the chain up until
[04:42] the letters line up with each other you
[04:44] just make the curl Tighter and Tighter
[04:46] until the letters all line up and you
[04:48] stop and when you do that you end up
[04:51] with a
[04:53] pattern this pattern
[04:56] here where all the letters are paired up
[05:00] and the letters that are not the same
[05:01] that are paired are these base three
[05:03] reciprocals in symmetrical positions on
[05:06] the rubic cube in the alphabet just in
[05:08] case the the t is a 210 letter and the
[05:11] the f is the 012 letter Tav and v um the
[05:14] same with the r and the L the same which
[05:16] with the E and the M over here and all
[05:19] the others are paired properly um this
[05:22] is this last letter is paired as it's
[05:23] shown on the chart so when you make
[05:26] exactly six turns and then one turn up
[05:28] through the middle all the letters line
[05:30] up with each other and the question is
[05:31] what does this describe well we know
[05:34] from mathematics that a
[05:37] Taurus a donut a bagel Arthur's
[05:41] Taurus well here let me use the big one
[05:43] that doesn't make so much noise um can
[05:46] be mapped out with seven colors and if
[05:50] one
[05:50] makes these seven this is a kind of worn
[05:53] out model the ones that Arthur block
[05:55] cells knew are more flexible in this
[05:57] this one's been through the wars um
[05:59] these seven colors could in a sense
[06:02] correlate with those seven turns now
[06:04] that's not exactly right there's there's
[06:06] more detail there but this was our first
[06:07] jump on it and when you make the seven
[06:10] color map and you make all the regions
[06:11] when they're prop when they're stretched
[06:13] the same way the same size and shape you
[06:15] end up with a spiral that has three
[06:17] turns to it exactly there's two ways you
[06:20] can you can arrange it one is it has
[06:22] three turns around for each turn through
[06:24] the hole and the other form that's the
[06:27] black line here it's three times through
[06:30] for one time around and both of these
[06:32] are seven color Maps they both are
[06:34] mathematical definitions of the surface
[06:36] of a donut of a
[06:38] Taurus and you should read Arthur's
[06:41] reflexive Universe if you want to know
[06:42] everything there is to know about the
[06:44] Taurus it was uh better said than I
[06:48] could say it so the first thing we
[06:50] discovered is that the first verse of
[06:52] Genesis fits on the surface of a Taurus
[06:54] a donut and all the letters pair up we
[06:57] tried the second verse I didn't bring it
[06:58] cuz it's a big chart it's a much longer
[07:00] verse but the letters pair up the third
[07:02] verse is shorter and it's easy to see
[07:04] and i' I've modified the Taurus a little
[07:05] but you were sort of looking down
[07:07] through the coil this way and again you
[07:10] see how the letters pair up very
[07:12] symmetrically and the same kind of pairs
[07:16] hold
[07:18] um there has been statistical work done
[07:21] on the Hebrew Bible that shows that
[07:23] there is patterning at the letter
[07:26] level um the people who did the work
[07:29] initially
[07:30] um came to the conclusion that this
[07:33] proved that the text could only have
[07:34] been written by some Divine source and
[07:38] the academic true non-believers who
[07:40] looked at the same data said that this
[07:42] proved that people must have edited the
[07:43] story to make the patterns and this
[07:45] provve that only man could have written
[07:47] it um my feeling is that both groups are
[07:51] biased the data is good there is
[07:52] patterning in the Hebrew Bible there may
[07:55] be patterning in the Christian Bible and
[07:58] there is patterning in the Cor on but
[08:00] that the people examining this with
[08:02] prejudiced views are not being
[08:04] intellectually honest that this is
[08:06] neither a proof that God did it nor is
[08:08] it a proof that man did it before you
[08:09] can say what it is you have to figure
[08:11] out how it was done and understand not
[08:14] just from the statistics but from the
[08:15] process involved where it came from I
[08:18] think we are on to doing that with what
[08:19] we're doing here but that's for
[08:21] later so we found the way of making a
[08:25] model of the first verse of Genesis that
[08:26] fit on a donut and then the question is
[08:29] well that's nice but why would they do
[08:31] that what's the point of it well you
[08:34] don't really need the whole dut use this
[08:36] one again um the seven color map is
[08:39] enough to specify the donut in fact you
[08:42] don't even need the seven color map all
[08:43] you need is the
[08:46] vortex and if you make the vortex in a
[08:49] particular way which is something I'll
[08:52] show you as we go
[08:54] on um it's not this one where the
[08:58] outside comes parall to the
[09:00] equator it's a little like this one
[09:03] where the outside is a little more
[09:05] tipped it's not thin like a bagel it's
[09:09] like a living Taurus an apple a
[09:13] fruit you see in Genesis 111 and in the
[09:18] introduction to the Zohar the cabalistic
[09:20] text they refer to a fruit tree yielding
[09:23] fruit whose seed is in
[09:24] itself it's as if there's a circle of
[09:27] little spheres the seed pack inside of
[09:29] the meat of the fruit a bigger sphere
[09:32] now we know if we're modeling something
[09:35] hyperdimensional if we want to make a
[09:36] hyper Cube we put a little Cube inside
[09:38] of a big Cube and connect up the corners
[09:40] we call it a tessera and the in toout
[09:42] direction is the hyperd
[09:44] direction um we know um therefore the
[09:47] same can be true of a sphere if you have
[09:49] an ins sphere and an out sphere you have
[09:51] a hypersphere as Arthur has shown you
[09:53] can Model A hypersphere as a as a Taurus
[09:55] so again we're very consistent if you
[09:58] punch out the seed p and the flower in
[10:00] the stem you end up with with a thick
[10:02] donut I didn't bring the model that I
[10:05] usually bring but this this will serve
[10:07] and it can fall through itself just like
[10:08] this does and it has a hole down the
[10:10] middle and except the cross-section is
[10:12] different the cross-section is more like
[10:15] what we have here it's this sort of
[10:17] elliptical cross-section more or less
[10:20] elliptical like a like a fruit like a
[10:22] real
[10:23] fruit and we found
[10:26] eventually that if we took off just the
[10:29] edge edge of the vortex and we shaped it
[10:33] just so we ended up with a shape that
[10:36] looked like
[10:38] this there's a lot more to this than I
[10:41] just told you one thing that's
[10:43] distinctive is that this doesn't come
[10:44] parallel to the equator it comes down
[10:47] perpendicular to the equator eventually
[10:50] we discovered that the Taurus was a
[10:54] little more complex that in fact the
[10:56] best way to define this shape was was
[10:59] off of a so-called Taurus knot this is
[11:02] the 310 Taurus knot the one that's in
[11:04] the
[11:05] poster and the reason why this is of
[11:08] Interest as you can see from what's up
[11:10] on the wall is that if you look at this
[11:12] form from different directions you can
[11:15] see all Shadows two-dimensional outlines
[11:17] of all the Hebrew
[11:19] letters H we're pretty sure the same
[11:21] form or some very very closely related
[11:23] form produces the Arabic letters and a
[11:27] related form but not quite the same
[11:28] produces the Greek letters and so we've
[11:31] got the first verse of Genesis folding
[11:33] itself up into a form that when you look
[11:36] at the form from different directions
[11:37] makes all the letters in which the text
[11:39] is written so the question becomes why
[11:41] would anybody do
[11:43] that um and we'll talk about
[11:47] that another thing that comes from the
[11:49] first verse of Genesis is not only does
[11:52] it fold itself up into this Vortex form
[11:55] but it also folds itself up into a
[11:57] tetrahedron
[11:59] um in
[12:01] fact Hebrew is really tricky um this
[12:04] three-letter combination bit R Shala is
[12:06] the same as this one here here it's
[12:08] translated created here this is the
[12:11] first word translated in the beginning
[12:14] bit but if we broke the word up into
[12:17] barah and then sheis we would have
[12:19] created whatever this word means well
[12:21] that word means either six or a
[12:25] thorn six Edge thorn
[12:30] so it could very well be even even in
[12:31] the word
[12:33] level when you look at the thorn you
[12:37] notice it is entirely
[12:39] symmetrical it's the lowest order most
[12:42] compact most symmetrical form in three
[12:44] dimensions if you look at this Vortex
[12:47] form it's entirely asymmetrical there's
[12:49] no two ways you can look at it where to
[12:51] look the
[12:53] same the contrast between Symmetry and
[12:57] asymmetry is this ultimate a contrast is
[13:00] any possible it's a yin-yang contrast um
[13:03] it's a fundamental distinction it's a
[13:05] primary distinction now we know that um
[13:08] mathematician named Spencer Brown wrote
[13:10] a book called laws of form which I
[13:12] talked about before thank you it's our
[13:15] timekeeping um um and the laws of form
[13:19] Spencer Brown says um let's see I think
[13:22] it's quoted in the in one of the older
[13:23] tourist journals that um you can make a
[13:26] whole Reality by simply making a Mark
[13:28] that distinguishes inside from outside
[13:31] and either Spencer Brown or other
[13:33] mathematicians have proven that you can
[13:34] derive all of formal mathematics all
[13:36] formal logic from that Mark of
[13:38] Distinction the distinction between
[13:40] inside and outside the Hebrew letter
[13:43] bait represents the distinction between
[13:46] inside and outside bait means a house it
[13:48] distinguishes between inside and
[13:53] outside
[13:55] our little Vortex can be placed inside a
[13:59] tetrahedron making a light in a meeting
[14:01] tent an eternal flame hanging on hanging
[14:04] on three chains in front of a sanctuary
[14:06] in a synagogue or in a church a green
[14:08] flame of Islam if you like in the Muslim
[14:11] tradition um the flame inside and the
[14:15] tetrahedron outside is again a model of
[14:18] inside and outside a model of logical
[14:21] structure and continuous Dynamic process
[14:25] a rigid masculine logical structure a
[14:29] continuous cyclical feminine process or
[14:32] is it a feminine vessel with a
[14:34] penetrating masculine form inside which
[14:37] is Yin and which is Yang which is
[14:38] masculine which which is feminine
[14:40] depends on your perspective they're not
[14:41] absolutes it's the contrast that's an
[14:43] absolute it's the distinction that's
[14:45] important otherwise you have to keep
[14:46] track of your convention so we found a
[14:49] model of primary distinction
[14:51] geometrically we identified it as
[14:54] capable of generating all of formal
[14:56] logic which is a pretty big job and we
[14:58] find it at the beginning of the text of
[14:59] Genesis both at the letter level at the
[15:02] word level and at the level of the whole
[15:04] first verse well of course there's a
[15:06] teaching the teaching is that the text
[15:09] of the Bible um given by God in this
[15:12] teaching um is structured in a very
[15:16] interesting way it's said that the
[15:17] secret of the universe is in the first
[15:19] letter of the sacred text but if you
[15:21] can't figure it out from the first
[15:22] letter God is very merciful and repeats
[15:25] it for you in Greater detail in the
[15:26] first word in the first verse in the
[15:29] first chapter in the first book it's a
[15:32] hierarchical array at least that's
[15:34] what's being described we are
[15:36] discovering that they're telling the
[15:40] truth if you look at a newborn child
[15:43] after it's finished doing getting born
[15:45] in necessities and assuming it's not
[15:47] swaddled the child is lying there in the
[15:49] crib and it ends up wiggling its hands
[15:53] and fingers in front of its eyes I think
[15:55] it's pretty Universal I don't know does
[15:57] anybody not think that that's
[15:59] Universal hasn't observed something like
[16:02] that what's the child
[16:04] doing well it's doing something
[16:07] absolutely
[16:08] essential you see most of us I can't do
[16:11] it I don't know which internal feeling
[16:13] Wiggles my ears I never connected up
[16:14] that muscle but a newborn child's got a
[16:17] whole bunch of internal reality it can
[16:20] move its limbs in the womb even so there
[16:22] there's a connection between internal
[16:23] feeling and the ability to move but of
[16:26] course in the womb there's no outside
[16:29] the child doesn't hear doesn't see
[16:31] doesn't
[16:32] smell it can connect it but there's no
[16:35] there's no reference doesn't come back
[16:37] in order for the child to know what
[16:39] where how who its hands are it has to
[16:44] project a feeling that moves its fingers
[16:47] and then it has to see it's actually
[16:48] moving its fingers not moving its toes
[16:50] or its nose or something it has to sense
[16:53] with its external senses see with its
[16:55] eyes smell with its nose hear with its
[16:57] ears at the same time as it's internally
[17:01] moving its own hands that
[17:05] crosscorrelation between external senses
[17:08] and internal feelings is what creates
[17:10] the Incarnation that's what incarnates
[17:12] us now we don't do it only with our
[17:14] hands the hands are our archetype we
[17:16] obviously move the rest of our bodies
[17:17] and and all Etc and I remember as a very
[17:20] young child I really couldn't tell if I
[17:21] bitten my tongue or bitten my lip had to
[17:24] feel it sometime I just couldn't sort
[17:25] that one out I hadn't done that I think
[17:27] that's probably fairly common that they
[17:28] feelings you don't know which toe it is
[17:30] sometimes you have you have to work it
[17:32] out got to check it
[17:33] out so the process of cross-correlating
[17:36] internal and external feelings is in
[17:38] fact what we mean by being incarnate
[17:40] it's how we know we're
[17:42] here so the hand which is the archetype
[17:45] for all of this is Central the principle
[17:47] it represents is
[17:49] Central um our speech centers broker
[17:52] regions and wores regions are taken from
[17:54] the cortex that controls the hand so our
[17:56] speech our alphabet which is related to
[17:58] our speech obviously is naturally
[18:00] connected to our hand gestures and it's
[18:02] been clinically demonstrated that in
[18:04] young children that are learning
[18:06] language hearing impaired children um
[18:08] learn hand gestures using the same
[18:10] neural Maps as normal hearing children
[18:12] do and I think that's that stands the
[18:15] reason too so we we're dealing with
[18:17] something very fundamental to reality
[18:19] when we're dealing with our hand uh I
[18:21] didn't bring the quotes this time I
[18:22] think they're with the other videotape
[18:24] but basically um my manes and the guide
[18:27] that perplexed explains a statement that
[18:28] it's in the Psalms I believe where it
[18:30] says that a righteous person is supposed
[18:31] to be aware of God at all times and the
[18:33] rabbis in their natural way say well how
[18:35] you supposed to do that that's very nice
[18:36] but how you do that and the answer is
[18:39] the way you can be aware of God at all
[18:41] times is to be aware of your hand at all
[18:44] times because of the ease of its motions
[18:48] what that means is if you're aware of
[18:50] how you're projecting your conscious
[18:52] will into the external World primarily
[18:55] by means of your hands could use your
[18:56] foot too then you're aware by analogy of
[19:00] how God in principle is projecting the
[19:02] universe from God's Will and thus you're
[19:05] aware of God and in in cabalistic
[19:07] teachings the universe is said to be
[19:09] projected from God's will as distinct
[19:10] from God's essence you don't spill your
[19:13] guts on the outside when you move your
[19:14] hand you just indicate what's on your
[19:16] mind so it's not your essence that
[19:18] you're
[19:19] giving I really want to go through all
[19:21] these hand gestures and I want to go
[19:23] through these meanings um and I want to
[19:25] show how they're related to Arthur's
[19:27] turn which we talked about in previous
[19:29] discussions and how when you take the
[19:32] turn with its seven levels in this
[19:34] mirror image form and embed it as
[19:38] process between unity and wholeness
[19:40] between the seed and the fruit you end
[19:42] up with a nine stage
[19:46] system extending in three levels nine
[19:49] stages an archetypal level and internal
[19:53] spiritual level and an external physical
[19:55] level and you can lay out the mean
[19:58] meaning of all of these Hebrew letters
[20:01] based on the logic of Arthur's seventh
[20:04] cycle on the Taurus and we've discussed
[20:06] that on previous occasions also and so
[20:10] what we've done is assign these meanings
[20:14] logically discovered that in fact they
[20:17] fit the historical understanding of the
[20:20] meaning of the letters except instead of
[20:24] looking like these old Canaanite letters
[20:27] these old pictograms Which derived from
[20:31] Pagan Idol idols and Ox the tan Ox of
[20:36] the solar god of the tan age which was
[20:39] absolutely unacceptable to
[20:41] monotheists the Hebrews and later the
[20:43] Christians and the Muslims they had to
[20:45] replace the picture of an ox which or
[20:48] the picture of of these different Pagan
[20:50] images which derives from these Pagan
[20:53] images with a gesture a hand gesture
[20:57] that had the same same basic meaning but
[21:00] was non idolatrous so instead of the
[21:03] solar deity being an
[21:05] ox Pagan symbol one takes one's
[21:10] hand I can put my pointer down and pick
[21:12] up another
[21:13] pointer and points to one's solar plexus
[21:17] one's own solar
[21:20] center up here we see some traditional
[21:23] views here's how Arthur laid out the 12
[21:26] houses of the zodiac
[21:29] on his combinational cycle on the
[21:31] Rosetta Stone of meaning here's Arthur's
[21:33] Rosetta Stone this is from the um
[21:35] geometry of meaning and I think it's
[21:37] probably also in the reflexive Universe
[21:40] um this circle of 12 houses with these
[21:45] natural meanings are the same as this
[21:49] circle of 12 fingers are the same as
[21:53] this circle of the zodiac this solar
[21:56] center mapped out on a person standing
[21:58] there in the place of the tree the
[22:01] person is hung on the
[22:05] tree I think we've heard that story a
[22:07] few places um likewise I brought
[22:12] along this is um I think from a church
[22:15] someplace I don't know I've never really
[22:16] seen one used but I guess it's what they
[22:17] serve the wafer from or something
[22:19] someone sent this to me but what you can
[22:21] see it what it really is is it's top
[22:23] half of this it's this part here and
[22:26] this Earth plane here now I'm using it
[22:28] as a model I'm not saying that that's
[22:29] what this was intended to be but what
[22:31] we've got is this this cup this chalice
[22:34] in the middle see this is this wine cup
[22:37] this chalice this Grail
[22:40] cup and so of course the Grail Legends
[22:43] fit the same model too nobody walk into
[22:45] that and so this is the top of my of my
[22:49] the top or the bottom of my apple and
[22:52] here this is a broken one but you can
[22:53] see how pretty it is when you make it
[22:55] really carefully um this is this is the
[22:57] hand this is all also the wing of the
[22:59] cherubs sitting on top of the Ark cover
[23:03] um in fact we've got a computer graphic
[23:04] that shows that and I'm not sure where
[23:07] it is in my
[23:08] pile I think it's worth taking it moment
[23:10] to find
[23:11] it yes here it
[23:15] is the upper picture is the hand model
[23:18] the lower picture if you turn it
[23:19] sideways these are the two cherubs with
[23:22] their wings and the fiery point in the
[23:25] middle from which God supposedly speaks
[23:29] from which the projection the seed
[23:30] center from which the projection takes
[23:32] place these will these will be available
[23:35] eventually so that these traditional
[23:38] rosac crucian type images and here we
[23:40] have their doves wings well again Wing
[23:44] flying
[23:45] wing um all of the symbolism here's
[23:48] another Greek gods on on a zodiacal
[23:50] plate here we have an alchemical wedding
[23:54] we have the Sun and the Moon the Sun and
[23:58] the Moon
[23:59] this is the rivers it's the Mari
[24:03] otherwise known as Mary in the Christian
[24:05] story um and this is the solar deity and
[24:08] this from above is the star coming down
[24:11] or sitting at the center and this
[24:12] three-way cross in the middle is our
[24:15] triple cross well I've got more of it in
[24:18] here than we need forget about the
[24:20] yellow lines it's the purple lines that
[24:22] that Define the cross angles of the
[24:25] tetrahedron it's again this six-sided
[24:27] thorn
[24:30] so that they all come together in the
[24:32] same basic model put some of these
[24:34] things away now let's just go through
[24:37] the letters because otherwise I'm going
[24:38] to run out of time and I really do want
[24:40] to talk about some other things too and
[24:42] there's a whole section I didn't get to
[24:43] which I hope I'll get
[24:45] to I'm going to use um instead of the
[24:47] full hand because it's a little hard to
[24:49] see which Edge it is I'm going to use
[24:51] the thinner one the finger width one and
[24:54] I'm going to use my right hand this is a
[24:55] soft old model and I'm going to use my
[24:57] left hand now what I see in my right
[25:00] hand from my eye's own point of view you
[25:03] could see in my left hand if you look
[25:05] through the model into my eye of course
[25:07] sometimes my hand is down here and you
[25:08] have to be on the floor to do that so
[25:09] I'm going to have to pick it up to show
[25:10] it to you but basically we're going to
[25:13] go through all of these gestures now the
[25:15] table here is
[25:16] arranged in what is known as atbash a
[25:20] against t b against s it's an acronym it
[25:24] means compare the front to the back of
[25:26] the alphabet in pairs I can't quite show
[25:29] it to you yet because I haven't finished
[25:31] doing the work but it appears that each
[25:33] one of these pairs is paired on a
[25:36] different axis and there were 11
[25:39] axes and that's part of the geometry
[25:42] that comes out naturally
[25:43] also so let's go through it I I don't
[25:46] think I need to look at the chart I
[25:48] think you can just watch me and then you
[25:49] can watch the chart and so um you should
[25:51] be seeing in my left hand what what's
[25:54] here even though I'm seeing it in my
[25:56] right hand when I put my hands to my
[25:59] solar plexus meaning all one
[26:03] centered the the center of the system I
[26:05] see the Hebrew letter Olive meaning all
[26:09] everything archetype when I open my
[26:11] hands in a birthing gesture breaking
[26:14] open I see the letter
[26:16] bait and again you should be able to see
[26:18] if you know the Hebrew letter bait you
[26:20] should be able to see it there this is
[26:21] the Rashi bait gimmel gimmel means camel
[26:26] a camel goes back and forth between
[26:28] oases remember we're in a desert culture
[26:30] here here's the water from the oases and
[26:33] here the two humps on the back of the
[26:34] camel back and forth
[26:37] relationship dollet to pour down to
[26:40] dispense a Delta is where the river
[26:42] widens broadens out and disperses the
[26:44] flow into the sea dollet Pours Down
[26:48] pours out dispenses divides dutes and
[26:50] dilates dollet Delta dilate dilute all
[26:55] the same route
[26:58] hey means the frame it's a window frame
[27:00] I'm framing my head I'm framing my
[27:02] shoulders I've got my hands on my
[27:03] shoulders hey V is over my spine it's my
[27:08] spin axis now look I don't have to see
[27:10] my hand I can always see my hand in my
[27:12] mind's eye even if it's behind my head
[27:15] no
[27:16] problem Zion means to project well
[27:18] anybody can see I'm
[27:20] projecting spooky well wait no it's St
[27:22] Patrick's say not Halloween it's
[27:24] projecting uh trans walking hey
[27:28] means to Encompass or to encircle well
[27:30] down at my perimeter if I look under my
[27:32] hand I see the
[27:34] letter T is to hold the hole in your
[27:37] hand um yud is me I my personal
[27:42] Consciousness me
[27:43] me um cough is the palms of my hand
[27:48] lamid is to learn to abstract is the
[27:50] flame see here's the flame and it's
[27:52] reflecting right back into me right back
[27:54] into my eyes that should be on my other
[27:56] hand here's the flame here's the
[27:57] reflector
[27:58] this is Aladdin's
[28:00] lamp you hold it in your hand you rub it
[28:03] and you go into the meditation from
[28:04] which the magic
[28:07] manifests there's the crescent and
[28:08] there's the
[28:10] star in the Islamic
[28:14] scheme got as far as lit lit me means
[28:17] Source the source of speech is at the
[28:20] throat there's the
[28:23] me nonon is a neck or Nexus it connects
[28:26] AM and PM we call it noon
[28:29] none the fish in the middle of the water
[28:31] none it's just this Arc here just the
[28:34] The Arc
[28:35] part somach means to support or sustain
[28:37] if I make a cradling motion I see my
[28:40] somic hanging there in my
[28:42] hand and we're just we're just going
[28:44] down um where we are now is coming up
[28:48] the bottom and we're up to here this is
[28:51] Sonic iron means eyes and so I put
[28:55] blinders on my horse I'm the horse
[28:57] there's the iron sitting right here eyes
[29:00] projection sight line sighting iron heay
[29:03] means mouth if you don't want to break
[29:05] your wrist the only way you're going to
[29:06] see the pay is to put your hand to your
[29:09] mouth sadii means righteous upright
[29:12] clean clean hands upright kof is a
[29:16] monkey I'm dangling from a tree limb re
[29:19] is my head raise to project raise Sheen
[29:23] is to shine and T is
[29:26] myself notice T is the opposite of
[29:29] olive notice I'll do it with one of
[29:33] them this is the letter Sheen in
[29:39] Hebrew it's supposed to pair with bait
[29:42] right now that's not drawn as well as it
[29:45] might but we just turn it around and
[29:46] there's our
[29:47] bait did I get those right or I have
[29:49] them backwards wait a minute I think
[29:51] that must be Sheen to you that's Sheen
[29:52] and this is bait to you right great
[29:55] remember front and
[29:56] back okay
[29:59] okay now you don't really need the
[30:02] models to do it you could look at the
[30:03] chart and just put your hands in fact we
[30:06] think that this older elephantine
[30:07] version of the letters is actually the
[30:09] outline of the hand itself without even
[30:10] holding the model except that it's
[30:12] become stylized and I don't think that's
[30:13] a good sample of of the
[30:15] letters now it's very important which
[30:18] style of alphabet we're looking at the
[30:20] Modern Hebrew letters are little small
[30:22] here are these more Square letters the
[30:25] letters we're making are a more fluid
[30:27] form form of the same alphabet the um
[30:30] the far right column is from a Papyrus
[30:33] that was found on elephan island um in
[30:37] the it's where the um SE Canal is now I
[30:40] don't remember which is the red and
[30:41] which is the dead anymore Red Sea Red
[30:43] Sea obviously um and is is from 300
[30:47] BC these are samples of the letters as
[30:50] they were known in Islamic Spain and
[30:53] this column here the second one from the
[30:55] left yeah second one in the boxes is the
[30:58] actual handwriting of a rabbi noades nak
[31:02] manes debated with Pablo christiani
[31:06] under King James II of Aragon around
[31:09] 1200 in a
[31:11] disputation um forced upon nak manes by
[31:14] the
[31:15] Inquisition and during the
[31:17] disputation um the question of who's the
[31:20] messiah comes up seems to be a
[31:22] issue uh between the Christians and Jews
[31:25] during the Inquisition obviously um and
[31:28] um nak manes admits that it says in the
[31:31] scripture that the Messiah is born when
[31:33] the Temple's destroyed and since the
[31:35] temple was destroyed in their case about
[31:37] 1200 years earlier the court asked nak
[31:39] manes so is is the Messiah and he says
[31:42] well just because someone's born doesn't
[31:43] mean that's when they become known he
[31:45] said well look man 1200 years I mean
[31:47] this guy's get a little old so where is
[31:49] he he says well the teachings are that
[31:51] the Messiah is waiting is always
[31:53] available is waiting in par days in
[31:56] Paradise now that's very interesting
[32:00] because about the same time maybe 100 CE
[32:05] really about the beginning of of the
[32:07] Christian era and the time when there
[32:08] was all kinds of difficulties there was
[32:11] a rabbi named akba one of the principal
[32:14] authors of the talid the oral Torah um
[32:17] and also um supposedly one of the
[32:19] authors or redactors of the sephira the
[32:22] book of formation that describes the
[32:24] formation of the alphabet and Akiba was
[32:26] known as The Master of the alphabet the
[32:29] Bal the master of the
[32:31] letters and akba is described in the
[32:34] talid as having been achieved great
[32:36] levels of meditational skill which was
[32:38] still permitted those days this was
[32:39] while rabbis were still meditating and
[32:41] it was before the Nan Council which
[32:43] threw all this stuff out of Christianity
[32:45] also um akba is said to have gone in
[32:48] meditation to par days to
[32:52] Paradise um and he went I guess they
[32:56] went separately but they all did it um
[32:58] with three friends three other rabbis
[33:00] who were equally qualified one was so
[33:02] overwhelmed by the ego death experience
[33:05] in pares that he stayed there died
[33:07] didn't come back another one came back
[33:09] but he had a bad trip he came back
[33:11] psychotic third guy came back um he gave
[33:15] up his religion he became a total
[33:16] heretic but he was still considered so
[33:18] smart that they still quote him in the
[33:20] tment even though he's dirt but he's
[33:25] smart well you know you have your PR
[33:28] and akba uh akba comes back H and he's
[33:30] the hero of course he comes back and I'm
[33:32] not sure sure of the historical temporal
[33:35] sequence here but either before or after
[33:37] because had to be one or the other Akiba
[33:40] comes back and he appoints Ben casba the
[33:44] Jewish General then fighting the Roman
[33:46] wars against the Jews with the Romans um
[33:50] as Baraka Baraka means son of the
[33:53] star this is within what a 100 Years of
[33:56] the founding of the Christian religion
[33:58] and here's a rabbi designating a messiah
[34:01] who's son of the star again strange
[34:04] story well unfortunately or we would
[34:07] have heard different um the Romans kill
[34:09] Baraka and that ends the story um he
[34:12] doesn't get resurrected in this version
[34:14] this is a different religion Jewish
[34:17] version the point is that akba goes to
[34:21] pares based on his knowledge of the
[34:23] alphabet discovers the Messiah principle
[34:26] and comes back and makes a statement
[34:28] about it nak manes 1200 years later is
[34:30] telling the Inquisition about this so
[34:33] where's the Messiah where's this this
[34:35] Messiah effect this this outof body ego
[34:37] death world changing death and rebirth
[34:40] effect it's in the meditation where's
[34:42] the meditation the meditation is in the
[34:45] text letter by
[34:47] letter in the text of of of the Hebrew
[34:49] Bible perhaps also although we don't the
[34:52] gospels have been translated so it's not
[34:54] clear if you can do it at the letter
[34:55] level there and also perhaps there's
[34:57] there's cing in the Quran um is it
[34:59] throughout in every case I don't know if
[35:02] it's like DNA and they didn't have to
[35:04] know about DNA to know that DNA is
[35:05] logical the structure of DNA was
[35:07] predicted before it was discovered it
[35:08] was predicted mathematically based on
[35:10] information Theory they didn't have our
[35:12] information Theory but they still had
[35:14] philosophical depth that could have
[35:15] given the same
[35:16] information um DNA has dense coding and
[35:19] wide coding so that you don't have to
[35:22] specify a Direction with any one letter
[35:25] it could be a sequence of letters that
[35:26] pointed it to a Direction youd still
[35:28] have room to make any any word you
[35:29] wanted it's just that sum total of the
[35:31] letters would get you from here to
[35:34] there um the point is that the text if
[35:38] one can follow the
[35:42] way becomes the way to the miach Messiah
[35:48] experience the ego death and rebirth
[35:51] experience and if this is true the only
[35:55] place that such a prophetic tradition a
[35:58] science of Consciousness could credibly
[36:00] be stored and have come down to us has
[36:02] got to be in scriptural text nothing
[36:04] else has survived intact it's the only
[36:06] source is that one is not allowed to
[36:08] change even the slightest part of any
[36:10] letter and the Dead Sea Scrolls confirm
[36:12] that essentially there have been no
[36:14] changes the essentially similar
[36:17] Samaritan version of the old uh of the
[36:20] Books of Moses um doesn't contain this
[36:22] coding the spellings are different and
[36:24] there's a whole academic debate about
[36:26] that um I'm not going to do this with
[36:28] you this is from a dictionary this is an
[36:30] attempt to deduce to find out if our
[36:33] interpretation of what the letters mean
[36:35] is actually consistent with what you
[36:37] find in a dictionary so I took the
[36:39] suffix in Hebrew y nun and look listed
[36:43] all the words that are all the
[36:45] three-letter words that end in y nun
[36:47] each one has a one letter of the
[36:49] alphabet in front we know what each
[36:50] letter means too so we can in theory
[36:53] interpret these decipher them you can
[36:55] look at the comparisons for yourself I
[36:57] think there's one to I left out that
[36:58] either means I I skipped it on the on
[37:00] the text editor or there was no word in
[37:02] the
[37:03] dictionary what we find is it confirms
[37:05] the meaning yud is a pointer your hand
[37:09] nun as I said is to connect but a final
[37:12] nun is to connect with infinity to go to
[37:14] the nth degree pointing to the end of
[37:16] degree is what we mean by going on or
[37:18] pointing or just the in ending to
[37:19] something and if you put the in ending
[37:21] on the meaning of each of the letters at
[37:22] the beginning of the word you get
[37:24] something that corresponds very closely
[37:26] to the dictionary meaning for for the
[37:27] word so the word for instance Dean
[37:32] Justice law and judgment dollet means
[37:35] dispensation dispensing dispensation of
[37:37] pointing pointing the finger at
[37:39] dispensing Justice we call it that
[37:43] um I don't know the pronunciation the
[37:45] vowels here Zion Yun means an arm
[37:48] equipment an axe a spear or a weapon
[37:51] Zion is a project is to project and
[37:54] yudan is to go on yon is to go on
[37:56] project and go on is what a weapon or a
[37:58] spear is you can look at the list for
[38:02] yourself so that takes us through the
[38:05] letters um it takes us through the
[38:07] letters based on a logical structure
[38:09] which we described in The Matrix of
[38:10] meaning for sacred alphabets tape which
[38:12] we did here about 3 years ago maybe a
[38:14] little longer now um The Logical
[38:18] structure gives you the 27 pointing
[38:20] directions which are equivalent as you
[38:23] may see from something else I handed out
[38:25] to the 27 lines that make up the shantra
[38:30] the creation mandala for the viic
[38:33] tradition nine interlace
[38:35] triangles now I don't have a big poster
[38:37] of it no I don't have a big poster of it
[38:40] but you should have you have the
[38:41] drawings and these nine
[38:44] triangles can be decanted as the little
[38:47] drawing
[38:47] shows into these nine triangles which if
[38:50] I point them right at you you should be
[38:52] able to see the
[38:53] shantra I may have it upside down you
[38:55] forgive me
[38:57] if you look at it sideways you'll notice
[39:00] that these tips all line up on a line
[39:04] and these tips all line up and the two
[39:07] lines form two parallels and there's a
[39:09] centri
[39:11] pin these nine are spiraling around on
[39:15] this line system in the same
[39:18] way as when I take my tetrahelical
[39:22] column and bend it
[39:24] around into this form it's as if the
[39:28] triangles are spread around the whole
[39:30] circle and you can look at at your own
[39:32] drawings and with the videotape we'll
[39:33] include the
[39:35] drawings let's see that I bring I think
[39:36] I have them here too someplace let me
[39:39] shuttle through some of my uh notes and
[39:41] catch up a
[39:44] bit um here's an interesting one this is
[39:47] from um the mathematical Intelligencer
[39:49] but it's a copy of something that was in
[39:51] Winfrey's book on Chaos on cardiac
[39:54] activity this is a map of the timing
[39:56] cycle the
[39:58] heart it's as you can
[40:01] see the troil
[40:04] knot it's one of the forms that produces
[40:07] this
[40:09] geometry if we take I use my shalele
[40:12] here if we take the uh this guy and we
[40:17] connect up the letters that form these
[40:20] base three pairs that pair off the
[40:22] letters in the
[40:23] alphabet they make this swirl of
[40:26] triangles this is exactly the same as
[40:29] the rubic cube except now it's on a form
[40:33] related to the alphabet directly and not
[40:34] a rubic cube that didn't exist in those
[40:37] days um these nine triangles should be
[40:40] the same as these that hasn't been fully
[40:42] demonstrated yet but we're getting
[40:44] closer and closer because you can see
[40:45] how you could flip this around and for
[40:48] those who want to talk about the math
[40:50] I'll show you what I think is going to
[40:51] happen but I haven't finished drawing it
[40:53] yet those same nine triangles
[40:59] also enable you to take the
[41:01] alphabet and connect the base three
[41:04] triplets that we're using for
[41:06] correlation with the traditional Left
[41:09] Right atbash
[41:12] Pairs and again you get this nine
[41:14] triangle strung on an umbilic toroid
[41:16] this is explained to some extent in the
[41:18] Taurus journals that we handed out so if
[41:19] you don't have this Taurus journal or
[41:21] the previous one you can get it from
[41:23] there and then of course there's this
[41:26] old drawing which I used to have up on
[41:28] the wall which I don't think I put up no
[41:29] and I didn't bother putting it up we
[41:31] made this
[41:32] um Shamrock troil troil form again three
[41:38] coil form put the letters on it in
[41:41] alphabetical order and on this form I've
[41:43] drawn in these purple triangles those
[41:45] are the same nine triangles but now
[41:47] you're looking down into the Taurus but
[41:49] those triangles are the same as the
[41:53] triangles
[41:54] here these over here
[41:57] so when you're looking at higher
[41:59] dimensional forms or complicated
[42:01] three-dimensional forms you need to look
[42:02] at many different views to get a sense
[42:04] of all the relationships no one view is
[42:06] going to show you how everything is
[42:08] related okay I was going to get to that
[42:11] now I want to um show you something new
[42:14] um which is not fully developed yet
[42:16] either but it's really very interesting
[42:18] for those of you who know something
[42:19] about the cabala and about sepher and
[42:22] the sapharic tree the Tree of Life in
[42:24] cabala if you take the two different
[42:27] seven color maps and peel off the two
[42:30] different spirals this one goes around
[42:33] three times for one time through the
[42:34] hole this one goes through the hole
[42:35] three times for one time around and you
[42:37] put the two of them together assuming
[42:39] that the same
[42:42] handedness you get this form the white
[42:45] line is from the bigger toroid and the
[42:47] blue line is from the smaller one in
[42:50] fact the blue line is the same as this
[42:51] green
[42:53] line when you put them together they
[42:56] intersect
[42:57] they weave they interleave just like you
[42:59] were making a
[43:01] basket they intersect in 10
[43:04] places those 10 intersections are the 10
[43:07] sphart on the tree of life and if you
[43:10] plug this model into the
[43:12] sepher and into the cabalistic texts all
[43:15] the relationships that are described on
[43:18] the tree of life are confirmable you can
[43:20] see why they made the claim why they
[43:22] connected this idea to that idea and
[43:23] this idea to that idea I'm going to
[43:25] write it up and that'll be another
[43:26] present ation but this breaks open the
[43:29] whole idea of the tree of life and for
[43:30] those of you who have studied the lanic
[43:32] cabala there's a discussion of the two
[43:35] circulations that come together to make
[43:37] the
[43:37] tree for some reason nobody seems to
[43:40] have made this model recently I'm sure
[43:42] they did in the past so this is our tree
[43:46] of life model which we're going to
[43:47] expand on these 10
[43:49] intersections probably this isn't proven
[43:52] correlate with these 10 points which are
[43:54] the spin axes of the tetrahedron
[43:56] remember the Vortex and the
[43:58] tetrahedron are
[44:02] compliments they should stay compliments
[44:04] as we grow
[44:06] them if they're true
[44:08] compliments I have a list here this
[44:11] doesn't prove anything this is anecdotal
[44:13] I'm going to I have a list here of a few
[44:15] Hebrew words I don't know how many
[44:17] people know Hebrew but I'm not even
[44:18] going to tell you what the letters are
[44:19] and you can figure it out from my hand
[44:20] motions I'm going to move my hand
[44:22] between these letters and you're going
[44:24] to tell me what the word means now I did
[44:27] one last time which is one an easy one
[44:30] and it's this
[44:31] one soon as you know what it is just
[44:33] raise your hand or say shout out what am
[44:35] I
[44:36] describing remember I'm Columbus and I'm
[44:39] meeting the American Indians for the
[44:40] first time and my diary says that I'm
[44:42] speaking them in Hebrew because they're
[44:44] the Lost
[44:45] tribes well unfortunately 1492 is when
[44:49] the Muslims and Jews were expelled from
[44:50] Spain and they signed on the crew and we
[44:53] know Rabbi nak manes because he was from
[44:56] Portugal
[44:58] knew these hand gestures for the letters
[45:00] if Columbus's crew did this in front of
[45:03] the Indians they would say Columbus was
[45:05] describing something that is round giml
[45:09] lamid means round in Hebrew now if I did
[45:14] this you know I meant to
[45:18] me to led me y if I wanted to say come
[45:24] I'm not asking you to guess him I'm
[45:25] doing it quickly come come bait Olive
[45:28] come come to
[45:30] me
[45:34] um let's see which one do I want to do
[45:37] um blah blah blah oh this is these two
[45:40] are good if I can do them um these are
[45:42] opposites one means open the other means
[45:45] close Okay this is one of them if I can
[45:49] do it
[45:51] right and the other one is
[45:57] you can see the emotions are opposite
[46:00] the first one was
[46:01] open p to
[46:05] a and the second one was closed
[46:09] SE zipped
[46:12] up um in Hebrew the word for a
[46:15] commandment from God is a Mitzvah it
[46:18] comes from the
[46:19] root um CA which occurs I believe in
[46:23] Exodus um it's a command from God
[46:28] let me get it right
[46:31] T to draw down righteousness
[46:35] righteous over the spine and extend it
[46:37] over the
[46:39] shoulders a commandment from God I think
[46:42] that gives you an idea we there are a
[46:44] few more here which if you want to ask
[46:45] questions we can get to um here is the
[46:48] lightning bolt that is said to descend
[46:50] the tree of life you will find the same
[46:53] lightning bolt on this form but I'm not
[46:54] going to show it to you now we'll save
[46:56] that for next time
[46:58] and one other pretty thing this is known
[47:01] as Dei
[47:02] surface it's a mathematical form
[47:05] everything nests back at Infinity every
[47:08] generational cycle connects to Infinity
[47:10] directly down the middle but each
[47:12] generation is separate on the outside
[47:14] this is the masculine path cut off and
[47:16] circumcised at every generation this is
[47:19] the feminine path umbilic to umbilic
[47:21] womb to womb
[47:23] endlessly they are orthogonal they're at
[47:26] right angles to each other and yet they
[47:27] form a whole Continuum a flower within a
[47:30] flower within a flower onion skin onion
[47:32] skin shells Shell Shell shells layer on
[47:34] layer on layer Vortex on Vortex on
[47:37] Vortex here we have a pentagonal spiral
[47:41] in two Dimensions that becomes an
[47:43] octahedral pyramid in three dimensions
[47:45] if we put this on the tip of the pyramid
[47:47] this Square form and pull it out it
[47:51] becomes a tetrah helix in projective
[47:54] four
[47:55] dimensions you can always trade
[47:57] dimensionality for symmetry five
[48:00] symmetry in 2D four symmetry in 3D three
[48:04] Symmetry and 40 and of course
[48:08] this is
[48:11] also pick at the bottom part The
[48:14] Vortex and in fact out of this
[48:17] Cornucopia comes all the platonic solids
[48:20] all of the
[48:21] symmetries they flow naturally one after
[48:25] another as you open up the hand the
[48:28] whole gamut of platonic in our comedian
[48:30] solids tumbles out in order out of the
[48:33] vortex out of the uh what do they call
[48:36] this
[48:36] cornicopia horn let's talk a little
[48:39] philosophy
[48:41] here one of the principles of mystical
[48:43] teaching of spiritual teaching of a
[48:45] science of Consciousness is that you
[48:48] have to somehow bring yourself into
[48:50] resonance with that which you're
[48:51] studying you have to obliterate that
[48:54] separation between foreign and itself
[48:57] you have to identify with the feelings
[49:00] going on whether it's following the way
[49:03] in the da the way whether it's following
[49:06] the way in Judaism called halaka which
[49:09] is the law which is the ritual law which
[49:12] is literally translated the way or
[49:14] whether it's following the way of Jesus
[49:15] and Christianity it's the same idea
[49:17] there probably an
[49:19] Islamic um version of that too I don't
[49:21] know the term
[49:23] um the way that's that's being talked
[49:26] about
[49:27] the the the issue here is to make
[49:29] yourself like the model well how do you
[49:31] make yourself like the model well the
[49:34] model is really interesting this hand
[49:35] model connects this inside to this
[49:38] outside it unifies them in the hand in
[49:42] one
[49:45] unity in the talmid which is the written
[49:49] version of the oral companion to the
[49:52] written Hebrew Bible which is not
[49:54] accepted by anything but but Jewish
[49:55] tradition but never nevertheless goes
[49:57] back about 2,000 years
[49:59] also um it's taught there's a phrase for
[50:03] a person of Integrity they're said to be
[50:06] toku cavaro toku is like our word take
[50:09] it means take in and cavaro is like our
[50:12] word Barak from here creation bar sheet
[50:15] to project out to create a person who
[50:18] was Toko cavaro whose inside is like
[50:20] their outside is morally
[50:22] transparent whether it's a righteous
[50:24] person aoic or saint Mother Teresa
[50:28] type it's someone who's morally
[50:31] transparent their inside and their
[50:33] outside are the same that's the really
[50:35] the only qualification for doing this
[50:37] work or learning these ideas it looks
[50:39] like a lot of mathematics but the
[50:41] mathematics is only the spreadsheet it's
[50:43] only the lattice for holding the
[50:45] information together and keeping it in a
[50:47] way that you can use it the math by
[50:48] itself is sterile it's only if we
[50:51] emulate the feelings that are being
[50:53] cataloged by the math that this can come
[50:55] alive and that we can deeply understand
[50:57] it we can hear it inside not just
[50:58] superficially not just
[51:02] outside all right so the key to doing
[51:07] this work is to make
[51:09] oneself have a measure of
[51:12] Integrity um I think it was Einstein
[51:14] that said I I don't have the exact quote
[51:16] but I'll get close to it he said that
[51:17] you shouldn't um judge a theory by the
[51:20] data you should only judge a theory by
[51:22] its internal
[51:23] coherence internal coherence is
[51:27] integrity everything fits together in a
[51:29] harmonious and complete ho a whole a
[51:33] model of
[51:34] Integrity so the issue here is how does
[51:37] one make oneself like the model well
[51:40] there are many ways in which that that
[51:41] happens um it's no secret we we know it
[51:44] already the model is a model hand the
[51:46] hand connects our inside and our outside
[51:49] we can always see our hand in our Mind's
[51:51] Eye if we pick something up behind us we
[51:53] can feel it with our hand and bring the
[51:55] image into our mind um the hand is the
[51:58] human embodiment of a general principle
[52:00] that connects Consciousness and physics
[52:02] or physics and Consciousness inside and
[52:04] outside so this is one model of
[52:06] Integrity if you will it generates the
[52:08] whole alphabet
[52:12] [Music]
[52:30] the second part of this this paper the
[52:32] second part in the back is a discussion
[52:34] of the Hebrew text
[52:36] sepher now
[52:38] sepher the book of formation it's
[52:41] cabalistic text there are many different
[52:44] translations um the best one available
[52:46] today is one by AR Kaplan um published
[52:49] by Sam Weiser which you can get um in
[52:52] any event it supposedly is a discussion
[52:55] of the creation of the AL alet but if
[52:57] you read anybody's translation you're
[52:59] not going to figure out how what they're
[53:00] talking about has to do with making the
[53:02] alphabet however if you plug these
[53:04] models and this interpretation in you'll
[53:06] figure it out one of the questions
[53:08] that's always come up is how much math
[53:10] did they know in the in the old days how
[53:12] could they have done this well it's
[53:16] difficult to prove for instance
[53:19] that people knew about this interl
[53:21] pattern but if you look at the second
[53:23] verse of the seph which is at least a,
[53:26] years old probably 2,000 years old and
[53:29] may even be 3,000 years old you find and
[53:32] you can read this for yourself the first
[53:34] verse of the SE reads in Translation 10
[53:38] Spirit of nothingness 22 Foundation
[53:40] letters three mothers seven doubles and
[53:42] 12
[53:44] Elementals um unfortunately that first
[53:47] line T SP of nothingness doesn't tell
[53:49] you a lot what's a Sparro and what's a
[53:52] nothingness and if you look in
[53:54] various translations of sephir you find
[53:57] the key word that doesn't seem to work
[53:59] is the word bimma in Hebrew which is
[54:01] either one word or two words and which
[54:03] has many different
[54:04] translations what we did is realized
[54:07] that a text at this old is just like a
[54:09] Bible text it was probably written
[54:11] almost certainly written without
[54:13] vowelization it was almost certainly
[54:14] written without word divisions which
[54:16] means that you're free to break the text
[54:18] up into different word clusters if you
[54:20] want to and if you do that as you can
[54:23] read here and break up the first phrase
[54:26] which
[54:27] isar
[54:29] into and then the
[54:33] letters m he what you find is if this is
[54:38] the
[54:41] Sophi then these remaining letters are
[54:44] the letters
[54:45] listed and the actual second verse of
[54:48] the seph says make this woolly ball out
[54:54] of the letters that we've just
[54:55] discovered make the wlly ball out of the
[54:57] first verse of
[54:58] Genesis it's a little hard for you to
[55:01] have eight letters all coincidental all
[55:03] connected together fitting exactly where
[55:05] they where they are and have it not be
[55:06] meaningful it's a lot harder to to make
[55:09] it non-meaningful than to see it as
[55:11] meaningful so I've given these Pages out
[55:13] and people watching the videotape if if
[55:15] it comes out well we we'll make it
[55:16] available will include this paper with
[55:18] the videotape so you can examine
[55:20] it the the idea is that there are my
[55:24] Idols by the way that's in quotes I
[55:25] really don't don't mean that these are
[55:27] Idols in the sense of simple graven
[55:29] images that simple people worship in the
[55:32] ways that our culture tends to put down
[55:35] the idols I'm talking about are the
[55:37] cultural paradigms that we all live by
[55:39] every day um the beliefs and science the
[55:43] beliefs in in um business in our
[55:46] government um um our way of seeing the
[55:49] world um these aren't false Idols at all
[55:51] they're reality so I don't mean Idols in
[55:54] the sense of false I mean Idols in sense
[55:56] of embodiments of important spiritual
[55:59] truths as they're understood in
[56:00] different cultures and when as I
[56:04] presented previously you dip below that
[56:07] stratum that individual cultural level
[56:10] and get down to the core you find that
[56:13] there's an abstract level that appears
[56:15] to be common to all cultures or at least
[56:17] to most and certainly the higher and
[56:18] greater and more refined the more they
[56:20] they tend to converge and people have
[56:22] proposed they've been common sources too
[56:25] our model says that there may have been
[56:27] common sources for different cultural
[56:28] teachings but that also they may have
[56:30] Arisen independently um and still be the
[56:32] same because they're based ultimately on
[56:35] our self-aware form of
[56:37] Consciousness so the first thing I would
[56:39] like to do um is to read you a poem um
[56:43] which you've probably all heard I
[56:45] remember hearing it once or twice when I
[56:46] was in high school um and I'm going to
[56:50] walk through it and try to identify some
[56:52] of the terms with some of the sacred
[56:55] geometry that we have up here but um I'm
[56:58] not going to be able to do that first
[56:59] I'm just going to read the poem but see
[57:01] as I say the words if you can spot
[57:04] analoges to what I'm going to say in
[57:07] this
[57:09] drawing we have here a kind of a fruit a
[57:11] kind of an apple a model of wholeness an
[57:13] orphic egg uh a light in the meeting
[57:15] tent a a um a walking cypress tree to to
[57:18] the Sufi tradition um there are 12 on
[57:22] the circle and we'll see why that is um
[57:25] we're dealing with about the alphabet um
[57:27] you could say that this is a river this
[57:29] is an Earth plane
[57:32] um let me read
[57:34] it this is um Samuel Samuel Taylor kid's
[57:40] kuon um and I'm not a very good reader
[57:42] so I'll bear with me um one of the first
[57:46] things that comes up is what does the
[57:47] word the name kublan
[57:50] mean um I don't know for sure but
[57:54] there's an interesting quality in Hebrew
[57:57] and in some other ancient languages and
[57:58] that is that the vowels are left out and
[58:02] that you can read the meaning from the
[58:04] consonant alone so if we drop out the
[58:07] vowels of kublan we get kbl and
[58:11] khn and this may be a silly coincidence
[58:14] I really don't know I haven't done the
[58:16] research most of the coincidences I'm
[58:17] going to tell you are not silly this one
[58:19] may be silly you could read that as
[58:21] cabala
[58:22] cohain um you could say that this is a
[58:24] description of something cabalistic from
[58:27] a Priestly perspective and as it turns
[58:29] out when you get to the end of the poem
[58:31] there's a kind of confirmation of that
[58:33] so let me just read it and see what kind
[58:34] of imagery it brings
[58:38] up in zanadu did kublan a stately
[58:42] pleasure Dome decree where Alf the
[58:47] sacred River ran through Caverns
[58:50] measureless to man down to a sunless sea
[58:54] so twice 5 miles of fertile ground
[58:56] ground with walls and Towers were
[58:57] girdled round and here were Gardens
[59:00] bright with sinuous reals were blossomed
[59:03] many and incense bearing tree and here
[59:05] were forests ancient as the hills and
[59:08] folding Sunny spots of greenery but oh
[59:12] that deep romantic Chasm which slanted
[59:14] down the Green Hill of thwart a cedar
[59:17] cover a Savage place is Holy an
[59:19] enchanted as air beneath a waning moon
[59:22] was haunted by woman whing for her Demon
[59:25] Lover
[59:26] and from this Chasm with ceaseless
[59:29] turmoil seething as if this Earth in
[59:32] fast thick pants were breathing a mighty
[59:35] Fountain momently was forced amid whose
[59:38] Swift half interred burst you huge
[59:42] fragments Ved like rebounding hail or
[59:45] chaffy grain beneath the thresher flail
[59:48] in mid these dancing rocks at once and
[59:50] ever it flung up momently the sacred
[59:52] River five miles Meandering with a
[59:54] amazing motion through wood and Dale the
[59:57] sacred River ran then reached the
[59:59] caverns measure measureless to man and
[1:00:02] sank and tumult to a lifeless ocean and
[1:00:04] mid this tumult Kubler heard from afar
[1:00:07] ancestral voices prophesizing War the
[1:00:10] shadow of the Dome of pleasure floated
[1:00:12] Midway on the waves where was heard the
[1:00:15] mingled measure from The Fountain and
[1:00:17] the caves it was a miracle of rare
[1:00:21] device a sunny pleasure Dome with caves
[1:00:24] of ice a damsel with a damer in a vision
[1:00:27] once I saw it was an abian maid and on
[1:00:29] her duler she played singing of Mount
[1:00:32] abora could I revive within me her
[1:00:35] Symphony and song to such a deep Delight
[1:00:37] would win me that with music loud and
[1:00:40] long I would build that dome in air that
[1:00:42] Sunny Dome those caves of ice and all
[1:00:45] who heard should see them there and all
[1:00:47] should cry beware beware his flashing
[1:00:50] eyes his floating hair weave a circle
[1:00:54] around him Thrice close your eyes with
[1:00:57] holy dread for he on honeydew hath fed
[1:01:00] and drunk the mil milk of
[1:01:03] paradise let me walk through it again
[1:01:05] and see if I can give you some sense of
[1:01:07] how what I just read might refer to what
[1:01:10] we're looking at um you should know that
[1:01:13] Samuel Samuel Taylor CID was an opium
[1:01:16] addict we are told um and he was um
[1:01:19] financed in his poetry and writing uh by
[1:01:22] Thomas and Joshua and Hosea Wedgewood of
[1:01:25] of the famous China Fame I think it says
[1:01:28] it on the copy and he worked with people
[1:01:30] like Charles Lamb and William woodsworth
[1:01:31] and Robert souy um some of which were
[1:01:34] well known to have been involved in
[1:01:35] mystical Pursuits so they might have had
[1:01:37] an awareness of the model that we're
[1:01:39] talking about and in an opium Revy um a
[1:01:43] poem describing the sacred geometry that
[1:01:47] we're saying is common to experience and
[1:01:49] cosmology might have been prompted by
[1:01:52] that cosmology the poem might have been
[1:01:54] prompted so
[1:01:56] zanadu is an interesting word
[1:01:59] itself um except I don't remember the
[1:02:02] reference so I can't go into that but we
[1:02:04] uh we tracked down a Hebrew word that
[1:02:05] actually makes sense of it do you
[1:02:06] remember what it was
[1:02:07] Cynthia we we translate anyhow I could
[1:02:10] look it up in the dictionary but I'm not
[1:02:11] going to do it now a stately pleasure
[1:02:13] Dome
[1:02:14] well let's
[1:02:17] say that this is the
[1:02:20] Dome Alf Alpha Olive the alphabet say
[1:02:25] acred
[1:02:26] River of course you could call the whole
[1:02:29] the whole form a sacred River and this
[1:02:30] is just the shadow of it on an Earth
[1:02:33] plane um
[1:02:36] Caverns um Tower
[1:02:39] walls um an incense bearing tree the
[1:02:43] central part is is a tree as those
[1:02:45] who've seen previous lectures realize
[1:02:47] that we're going to give give other
[1:02:49] examples um a waning moon the the face
[1:02:52] down here the the bottom is a crescent
[1:02:55] way raining
[1:02:56] Moon um floated Midway on the waves
[1:02:59] while this whole thing floats on this
[1:03:01] water level this Earth and level in the
[1:03:03] middle um Mount of Bora the beginning of
[1:03:07] the text of Genesis starts ber sheath
[1:03:10] Bora
[1:03:12] sheath um and at the very end he says
[1:03:15] weave a circle around him Thrice well
[1:03:18] you can't see it from there but you can
[1:03:20] see it here it literally has three rings
[1:03:22] that defined it three loops and
[1:03:27] these three
[1:03:28] Loops so there's three loops around the
[1:03:33] floor and that's going to come in handy
[1:03:35] when we talk about other metaphors here
[1:03:38] um for he on honeydew hath fed if you
[1:03:40] look in a Hebrew dictionary and look up
[1:03:42] what a honeydew is try to find the
[1:03:44] closest reference to that you get a word
[1:03:46] that refers to the Mana that was given
[1:03:48] in The Exodus story um and the word in
[1:03:51] Hebrew that refers to a honeycomb and
[1:03:54] the translation there is from L's
[1:03:56] translation of of book of Exodus
[1:04:00] ISAT if you take that letter by letter
[1:04:02] off our alphabet charts and look at what
[1:04:04] the word sapat means it means the
[1:04:08] highest or the most complete mouth that
[1:04:11] points to Something in circling
[1:04:15] itself a mouth that points to Something
[1:04:17] in circling
[1:04:20] itself so our little uh
[1:04:23] honeydew which turns out to be a
[1:04:27] melon it turns out also the word melon I
[1:04:31] believe there's a reference buried in
[1:04:32] here someplace which we'll get to later
[1:04:34] is the same word as the word for fleece
[1:04:37] or wool in one of the languages that
[1:04:40] we're going to discuss and so we're
[1:04:42] going to find that the search for the
[1:04:43] Golden Fleece in this Sufi soft sufa
[1:04:48] form is about this honeydew
[1:04:52] melon that's made up of wool the word in
[1:04:55] Hebrew or Arabic for wool is saf or suf
[1:04:58] thus sufis thus sofa meaning a storm
[1:05:01] cloud which we talked about last year um
[1:05:04] thus the Sufi round dance the a sof of
[1:05:07] the cabalistic tradition all of them
[1:05:09] mean wool fuzzy puffy cloudlike
[1:05:14] so there's
[1:05:16] kuon and he started this
[1:05:18] off and I I read that because I liked
[1:05:21] the poem and I was surprised to find
[1:05:22] that in the classic piece of poetry that
[1:05:24] I had to read in high school there was
[1:05:25] something calistic I don't know how it
[1:05:27] snuck through I guess they didn't they
[1:05:28] didn't see what I saw in
[1:05:30] it one of the most important
[1:05:34] ideas is
[1:05:36] that what we're doing
[1:05:39] here seems to be very complex it's got
[1:05:42] all this mathematical forms these knots
[1:05:44] and everything and I mean um think about
[1:05:47] it the queen of the Sciences is physics
[1:05:51] the king is mathematics the most subtle
[1:05:54] part of mathematics is topology
[1:05:55] anthropology is often done with not
[1:05:58] Theory now go back to the ancient world
[1:06:02] what experimental medium was
[1:06:05] available what did people work with did
[1:06:07] they have computers no did they have our
[1:06:09] modern mathematical formalisms no did
[1:06:11] they have algebra no did they have
[1:06:13] calculus no we don't think so maybe in
[1:06:14] some other
[1:06:15] form what did everyone do well they
[1:06:19] lived in tents and they moved around in
[1:06:20] the desert and they kept animals and
[1:06:22] they raised crops and they made ships
[1:06:24] occasionally and they they made farts
[1:06:25] and drag stuff around and all of that um
[1:06:28] you don't have to be a mathematical
[1:06:30] genius you just have to be a decent
[1:06:32] Carpenter to know two-legged stools fall
[1:06:34] over and three-legged stools stand up
[1:06:36] they knew that kind of math um you had
[1:06:39] to be able to make rope and tie knots
[1:06:41] and weave cloth and weave baskets
[1:06:45] because that's what you put stuff in for
[1:06:46] your normal living these are all weaving
[1:06:50] patterns this is a
[1:06:52] wreath it's not some fancy thing from
[1:06:55] some modern mathematical topology this
[1:06:57] is what somebody making a wreath 3,000
[1:06:59] years ago out in the desert would have
[1:07:01] probably done they would have woven a
[1:07:02] bunch of straw a bunch of cloth or a
[1:07:04] bunch of thread that they made up
[1:07:05] somehow maybe even a bunch of wool into
[1:07:08] a wreath into a woven pattern we're also
[1:07:12] going to see where they got the patterns
[1:07:14] from so that the technology for doing
[1:07:17] this kind of stuff this work was
[1:07:21] available even much higher technology
[1:07:23] was available in some cases um Beno
[1:07:26] mandelbrot the fellow who's given cred
[1:07:28] um given credit for the discovery of
[1:07:31] fractal mathematics about 15 years ago
[1:07:34] 20 years ago now about 20 years ago now
[1:07:36] I was asked um who should get credit for
[1:07:39] bringing forth fractal mathematics it um
[1:07:41] his he wrote the forward I believe to um
[1:07:45] Pitkin and sa's book I'm not sure now on
[1:07:49] fractals um and in the in the in the
[1:07:52] preface he says in the introduction he
[1:07:53] says that credit for fractal Theory
[1:07:56] although obviously not for making the
[1:07:58] images because they didn't have the
[1:07:59] computers goes to
[1:08:01] Archimedes Archimedes was aive when the
[1:08:05] Hebrew Bible was first translated into
[1:08:07] Greek about 300 years BC so yes they had
[1:08:11] the mathematics it wasn't in our form
[1:08:13] but they had the subtlety they had the
[1:08:16] sophistication and that we're finding
[1:08:19] these patterns are woven patterns really
[1:08:22] means that they had all the means
[1:08:23] necessary in fact weaving is preliterate
[1:08:25] I mean there were Bic Traditions that
[1:08:27] went around you know weaving Persian
[1:08:29] rugs and moving through the Middle East
[1:08:31] well before anybody started writing down
[1:08:33] anything at least that's what we think
[1:08:36] historically um I wanted to point out
[1:08:38] and did we put it up maybe we didn't
[1:08:40] maybe we didn't I guess we didn't well
[1:08:43] all right I'll have to hold this guy up
[1:08:45] now let's hold this one up because you
[1:08:47] can see it clearly it's got three little
[1:08:50] loops on
[1:08:52] it this is our
[1:08:55] St Patrick's Day
[1:08:58] Shamrock this is our three-leaf clover
[1:09:00] in this case so happy St Patrick's Day
[1:09:02] to all of you who are celebrating St
[1:09:04] Patrick's Day um St Patrick of course
[1:09:07] drove the serpents out of
[1:09:09] Ireland so maybe he was talking about
[1:09:12] this too I don't know that's pushing a
[1:09:13] little far um I read you the story in a
[1:09:17] previous occasion um of ri's poetic
[1:09:20] description of the Mev Levy Sufi round
[1:09:23] dance um the L Sufi tradition I could be
[1:09:27] wrong but I'm pretty sure this was in
[1:09:28] nosis magazine um recently um originated
[1:09:32] in the abazia region of what was
[1:09:34] previously Soviet Georgia where there is
[1:09:36] now a rebellion and people are getting
[1:09:37] killed if you look at a map as to where
[1:09:39] abazia is you find it's just across a
[1:09:42] little straight from Sebastapol in the
[1:09:45] Crimea which is where the ashkanazi the
[1:09:48] European Jews went when they left the
[1:09:50] Middle East as opposed to the safari
[1:09:52] Jews which went which went out through
[1:09:53] the Mediterranean and so there is really
[1:09:56] very little coincidence in room's
[1:09:59] description of the med Levy round dance
[1:10:01] fitting the same description that we
[1:10:03] have found for the hand model except to
[1:10:07] roomi the grain that no Granary
[1:10:09] comprehends is this little seed in the
[1:10:12] middle now did you ever see in the
[1:10:14] ancient world what a what a mill that
[1:10:16] grinds flour looks like there are
[1:10:19] two big Stones one on the bottom and one
[1:10:22] on the top like these two hemispheres
[1:10:24] and there's a hole in the the top you
[1:10:26] dribble the Grain in and you turn the
[1:10:27] stones in between it on this plane the
[1:10:31] grain is ground so this is our model
[1:10:34] Millstone Hamlet's Mill um and there's
[1:10:37] the seed the grain that L Granary
[1:10:39] comprehends because this is a
[1:10:40] meditational form this is a spiritual
[1:10:42] form not a physical
[1:10:44] one um roomie talks about a walking
[1:10:48] cypress tree well you can see this
[1:10:50] actually even looks a little like a
[1:10:51] cypress tree with its Tangled Twisted
[1:10:53] Roots sitting below the waterline at the
[1:10:55] bottom and springing up above and its
[1:10:57] branches going in directions on the side
[1:10:59] it's a walking cypress
[1:11:01] tree um he talks about um a circle of
[1:11:06] dancers around the Divine Point well out
[1:11:10] here we have four fingers the thumb goes
[1:11:12] in the middle and so if there three
[1:11:14] hands three hands on top there'd be a
[1:11:16] circle of 12 fingers on this
[1:11:19] perimeter those are the circle of 12
[1:11:22] dancers they could be the 12 imms they
[1:11:24] could be the 12 TR they could be the 12
[1:11:26] houses of the zodiac they could be the
[1:11:28] 12 apostles they could be any of the
[1:11:30] other 12 around ones 12 knights around
[1:11:32] the round
[1:11:34] table
[1:11:35] um roomy also talks about a fountain of
[1:11:38] light this is the fountain part and he
[1:11:40] talks about a waterfall this is the
[1:11:42] waterfall
[1:11:43] part and so room's description of the
[1:11:46] Mev Sufi round dance appears to describe
[1:11:48] the same sacred geometry except in the
[1:11:50] case of roomi one is supposed to be
[1:11:53] dancing it making oneself like it well
[1:11:55] there's my answer to where the path in
[1:11:57] Islam is because the sufis are mostly
[1:11:59] identified with the Islamic tradition
[1:12:00] these days and the round dance is in
[1:12:03] fact a path one takes to make oneself
[1:12:05] like this first verse of Genesis
[1:12:07] spinning around like this
[1:12:10] donut okay let me continue um there's
[1:12:12] some more reading to be done
[1:12:14] here um but before I get to it I wanted
[1:12:17] to to make another point I was talking
[1:12:19] with Professor Richard rhods UC Berkeley
[1:12:21] the other day um in the Linguistics
[1:12:23] Department I believe I hope I'm getting
[1:12:24] that right
[1:12:25] and he reminded me of something that
[1:12:27] he'd come across I guess a while ago um
[1:12:30] in the Japanese World there is a
[1:12:32] tradition of samurai sword
[1:12:34] making and what Richard pointed out is
[1:12:37] that you didn't really know need to know
[1:12:40] how to make a samurai sword all you did
[1:12:43] need to know was know how to follow the
[1:12:45] tradition exactly that the ritual even
[1:12:49] amongst people who don't know what
[1:12:51] they're doing can serve to preserve the
[1:12:53] technology the Deep teachings
[1:12:57] now that may be exactly what's happened
[1:12:59] in all of our modern religions is that
[1:13:01] there are different embodiments of
[1:13:02] different ritual systems that make sense
[1:13:04] in different cultural
[1:13:05] contexts if you follow them you follow a
[1:13:09] path that embodies in you these
[1:13:12] spiritual feelings these experiences
[1:13:15] whether in your mind's eye you're
[1:13:18] drawing your roof brain chatter down
[1:13:21] slowly to a single point of
[1:13:23] meditation or whether you you are the
[1:13:25] hero descending to the depths below the
[1:13:27] Earth plane and then climbing the
[1:13:29] spiritual mountain in seven sacred
[1:13:31] quests back towards your
[1:13:35] goal in the external world it's the same
[1:13:39] model this is the model of the hero's
[1:13:42] journey as Joseph Campbell's presented
[1:13:44] it on PBS over the last several years
[1:13:47] well until recently
[1:13:49] anyway um let me read you from a few
[1:13:52] other Traditions here and I'm going to
[1:13:55] try to be brief um I think we've given
[1:13:57] you some of these quotations and not all
[1:13:58] of them though um this is from Germanic
[1:14:02] mythology and the fate of Europe by
[1:14:04] Ralph mner um printed in revision volume
[1:14:07] 13 number one
[1:14:09] 1990 he's talking about Odin's three
[1:14:11] ways of knowledge
[1:14:13] three there are three stories of Odin
[1:14:16] that illustrate the character of this
[1:14:17] wandering truth Seeker magician they
[1:14:19] exemplify three ways of knowledge that
[1:14:22] form part of the wisdom teachings of the
[1:14:24] ancient European people ways of
[1:14:25] knowledge that we have for the most part
[1:14:27] lost and would do well to remember the
[1:14:28] first story is told in the poem haval
[1:14:32] words of the high one in which odm
[1:14:34] recounts how he hung himself
[1:14:38] voluntarily in self-sacrifice from the
[1:14:41] world tree yasol I hope I'm pronouncing
[1:14:44] that right which is the axis Mundy
[1:14:46] there's a spin axis through this thing
[1:14:48] from the stem to the seeds um the
[1:14:51] central pillar axis of the world of the
[1:14:54] world
[1:14:55] w o r l d w h i r l e d world I guess so
[1:15:02] um which holds all the various worlds of
[1:15:04] existence together in a unitary
[1:15:07] framework there it is to be hung from a
[1:15:11] great tree echo's ancient Asiatic
[1:15:12] shamanic initiation practices and he
[1:15:15] goes on and on and he also says Odin
[1:15:17] speaks of
[1:15:19] fasting and being pierced by a
[1:15:22] spear now I think most people whether
[1:15:25] they're Christian or not will recognize
[1:15:27] the story of early Christianity
[1:15:29] parallels what Ralph mner is saying was
[1:15:33] basis of the philosophy involving Odin
[1:15:35] in Europe in the old days um and there's
[1:15:38] some poetry here too and he says both
[1:15:41] fasting and self-inflicted plan are
[1:15:42] class classic components of shamanic
[1:15:43] Vision Quest of the ordeal type I think
[1:15:46] he's misinterpreting but let me read the
[1:15:48] poem um he says I know that I hung on
[1:15:51] that wind swept tree wind swept so storm
[1:15:55] cloud nine days and nights well we're
[1:15:58] going to get into the nine cycle pretty
[1:16:00] quickly pierced by the spear sacrific to
[1:16:03] Odin myself to myself
[1:16:07] self-referential on that great tree
[1:16:09] whose roots are
[1:16:11] unknown and I will skip continuing
[1:16:13] except for the next part of the poem
[1:16:15] where he says neither food nor drink did
[1:16:18] they give me I leaned downwards took up
[1:16:21] the runes with a cry then I came down
[1:16:25] Odin is able to descend from his
[1:16:26] voluntary crucifixion when he discovers
[1:16:28] the runes the secret symbol language of
[1:16:31] nature the runic alphabet which will'll
[1:16:35] maybe mention a few more times in some
[1:16:36] other quotes is what comes from this
[1:16:38] legend in the European
[1:16:42] tradition okay um this is from nor myth
[1:16:45] North Norse myths introduced and retold
[1:16:49] by Kevin Crosley Holland published by
[1:16:51] Pantheon fairtown folklore Library um
[1:16:54] and I'll just read from it he says a
[1:16:57] great many mythologies have a tree or
[1:16:59] column or Mountain at the center of the
[1:17:01] world a tree or column the mountain at
[1:17:04] the center of the world more
[1:17:05] specifically the symbol of three Cosmic
[1:17:07] regions connected by a tree three
[1:17:09] regions connected by the
[1:17:12] tree that we find a North North not
[1:17:16] doing good with Norse Norse mythology
[1:17:18] also appears in viic Indian and Chinese
[1:17:21] mythologies HR Ellis Davidson has
[1:17:23] written of yasol that
[1:17:25] the fact that it formed a link between
[1:17:27] the gods mankind the Giants and the dead
[1:17:30] meant it was visualized as a kind of
[1:17:31] ladder reaching up to heaven and
[1:17:33] downwards to the underworld a ladder
[1:17:36] reaching up and down up and down latter
[1:17:40] see the rungs
[1:17:43] rungs which is going to be on the tetrah
[1:17:46] Helix uh that was the on the world the
[1:17:49] conception of a Road between the world
[1:17:51] is one which is familiar in the beliefs
[1:17:52] of shamanistic religions well we've
[1:17:54] talked about the the idea of a road or a
[1:17:57] path um or a
[1:18:00] way
[1:18:02] um and I'm not going to go much more
[1:18:04] with this because it'll take too much
[1:18:06] time but he talks about nine worlds
[1:18:08] encompassed by the tree nine nights
[1:18:11] hanging on the tree nine magic songs um
[1:18:14] nine human beings nine animals there's a
[1:18:15] whole bunch of Nines in this if you want
[1:18:17] to check the references later I can give
[1:18:18] them to you but I think you get the
[1:18:22] drift basically what um Robert John and
[1:18:25] Brenda Dunner saying in margins of
[1:18:27] reality which is an excellent book which
[1:18:29] I can summarize very quickly they did
[1:18:32] experiments at the Princeton engineering
[1:18:33] anomalies research lab published work um
[1:18:37] which has then been published in a book
[1:18:38] also um they found that extra sensory
[1:18:41] effects were real but within the limits
[1:18:44] of the uncertainty principle so they
[1:18:46] don't violate determinism now I may be
[1:18:48] overstating that and you should read the
[1:18:50] book for yourself but that's what I got
[1:18:52] from it I think it's a beautiful finding
[1:18:54] because it means that you can have extra
[1:18:55] sensory effects and still have logic
[1:18:59] it's quantum mechanical World anyhow he
[1:19:02] says here that um Newton wrote
[1:19:04] extensively on Bible prophecy studied
[1:19:06] the occult symbolism in the structure of
[1:19:07] Solomon's Temple in the Great Pyramid of
[1:19:09] CH chops and exended immense effort
[1:19:12] performing experiments in its private
[1:19:14] alchemical laboratory his concept of a
[1:19:16] universal gravitational force connecting
[1:19:18] all bodies in the cosmos was clearly
[1:19:20] influenced by ancient mystical
[1:19:21] ponderings on the subject and I'm going
[1:19:24] to leave leave it there um except at the
[1:19:26] end he says the mystery by um another
[1:19:28] biographer has observed Newton regarded
[1:19:30] the ultimate mechanism of change in the
[1:19:32] universe to reside in quote the mystery
[1:19:34] by which mind could control matter
[1:19:36] unquote this is from Philosophy from
[1:19:39] thali anx
[1:19:41] anaxagoras um also from Egyptian light
[1:19:43] and Hebrew Fire by Carl
[1:19:45] lucard um he's talking about anaximander
[1:19:48] and he says um here we arrived at a
[1:19:50] crucial point in early Greek philosophy
[1:19:51] namely at anaximander vision of the
[1:19:54] cosmo
[1:19:55] cosmogonic process separating separating
[1:19:58] out that in turn is brought about by an
[1:20:01] eternal Motion in the apirion all things
[1:20:04] come and return to the apirion the
[1:20:06] infinite or boundless substratum of the
[1:20:08] universe and we're going to find of
[1:20:10] course that our Taurus literally is the
[1:20:13] first distinction in an infinite
[1:20:15] isotropic homogeneous Cosmic Jello in a
[1:20:18] peran and a sof and infinite nothingness
[1:20:22] uh um Quantum vacuum I think is it's
[1:20:24] current
[1:20:25] name um of special interest is
[1:20:29] information on an axamer provided by
[1:20:31] theopus hope I got that right as
[1:20:33] originally given by usus
[1:20:35] Yus he says that at the birth of this
[1:20:38] Cosmos a germ of hot and cold was
[1:20:40] separated off germ seed from the Eternal
[1:20:45] substance out of this a sphere of flame
[1:20:48] grew a sphere of flame grew about the
[1:20:52] vapor surrounding the earth The Vapor
[1:20:54] the the clouds surrounding the earth
[1:20:57] like the ark round a
[1:21:00] tree when this was torn away and shut
[1:21:02] off in certain Rings the sun moon and
[1:21:03] stars came into existence the sun is the
[1:21:06] center the Moon is the Crescent here and
[1:21:08] there's a Vortex that carries the stars
[1:21:10] in the Kepler bod theory on the surface
[1:21:12] of the bowl of the
[1:21:14] Taurus um thus instead of the more
[1:21:17] concrete first in the cosmos of nun as
[1:21:19] the water to which thales had referenced
[1:21:21] and ax Amanda has returned to a more
[1:21:22] vaporlike and less sensate
[1:21:23] conceptualization of the Egyptian nun
[1:21:26] from within it he derived the world and
[1:21:27] then the sun moon and stars all these
[1:21:29] emanated from the
[1:21:32] center successfully contained within
[1:21:34] rings of fire well we don't have the
[1:21:36] rings of fire there indeed in the
[1:21:37] Orthodox Egyptian context these fiery
[1:21:39] emanation Rings provide a rational
[1:21:41] pattern for visualization oh wait a
[1:21:43] minute a rational pattern for
[1:21:45] visualization seeing a pattern of
[1:21:47] letters in one's Mind's Eye a path of
[1:21:52] meditation maybe maybe
[1:21:55] atom was the central primeval Hill
[1:21:59] Sun from when all lesser realities came
[1:22:03] these successive emanations spewing from
[1:22:04] the hills Sun Center puff forth as rings
[1:22:07] of fire like a playful smoker May blow
[1:22:09] smoke rings that
[1:22:11] emanate and I'm skipping a little um
[1:22:14] here there too the godheads emissions
[1:22:17] are mentioned as fire or as the light of
[1:22:19] raw and at the very end of this little
[1:22:21] quote the dynamic link between atam and
[1:22:23] raw earthy Hill and athetic fire
[1:22:26] emanation is in the later generation of
[1:22:29] anadian gods depreciated from shub to
[1:22:32] gab sh shu to GB thus to Father Earth
[1:22:36] the he's talking about an an anagon of
[1:22:38] Egyptian gods or God ideas and the
[1:22:41] anagon again is just a cycle of nine and
[1:22:44] as we're going to see repeatedly in
[1:22:45] these models we're going to be looking
[1:22:47] at these cycles of Nine the Hebrew
[1:22:49] alphabet with 27 letters is three layers
[1:22:51] of cycles of Nine the hyper sphere
[1:22:55] Define where the 27 lines that solve the
[1:22:57] general cubic equation also produces
[1:23:00] three layers of nine this is from Cox's
[1:23:03] model of the polytope
[1:23:06] 221 I think in the interest of a uh
[1:23:11] smooth transition I'm going to mention
[1:23:14] um the allegory of Plato's Cave which
[1:23:16] I'm going to hope to read you at the end
[1:23:17] of the discussion um from this little
[1:23:19] discussion here where he's talking about
[1:23:21] the allegory of Plato's Cave as relating
[1:23:23] to an ego def
[1:23:25] experience which is of course part of
[1:23:27] what this is all about this would be
[1:23:29] Plato's
[1:23:30] Cave here is the sun here's the Earth
[1:23:33] plane if we were standing here the sun
[1:23:35] we would cast Shadows on the wall of the
[1:23:38] cave where did they get the models from
[1:23:42] we discussed models of the cyclicity of
[1:23:46] life these these solar cycle
[1:23:49] Zodiacs druidic principles of worshiping
[1:23:52] um sacred trees and growing things and
[1:23:55] the the fuar the druidic alphabet Celtic
[1:23:57] alphabet matches these living processes
[1:23:59] also um each culture comes up with a
[1:24:03] different cyclic process to represent
[1:24:06] important considerations but we all have
[1:24:08] the same database we've all got hands
[1:24:10] we've all got bodies we all have
[1:24:12] internal spiritual experience one way or
[1:24:14] another sometimes you have to fall off a
[1:24:16] Dunkey and hit your head sometimes you
[1:24:17] take a psychedelic sometimes you do a
[1:24:19] breathing exercise but it's accessible
[1:24:21] to all um we all experience the her
[1:24:24] Journey The Seven Ages of man
[1:24:26] Shakespeare seven as we go through
[1:24:28] life and we all observe the heavens in
[1:24:31] fact observing the heavens is another
[1:24:33] one of those technologies that we know
[1:24:34] the Ancients did a lot of had a lot of
[1:24:36] the Egyptians the Babylonians the
[1:24:38] samarians the Greeks everybody observes
[1:24:41] the heavens you got it you want to know
[1:24:42] when to plant your
[1:24:44] crops well if You observe the heavens
[1:24:47] here's Keith crlo but there were another
[1:24:50] number of other people involved this by
[1:24:52] the way is the 35 tus knot from math
[1:24:54] book this is from um plain algebraic
[1:24:56] curves by people's names I can't
[1:24:59] pronounce published in basil Switzerland
[1:25:02] um the 35 Taurus
[1:25:05] knot this is the 34 Taurus knot it's got
[1:25:08] four lobes and three
[1:25:11] intersections this is the 35 Taurus knot
[1:25:14] turned inside out it makes half of it
[1:25:17] the other half down there put the two
[1:25:19] together and you get the 310
[1:25:21] knot this is the form that most tightly
[1:25:24] correlates the first letters of the text
[1:25:26] of Genesis it's the simplified version
[1:25:28] of what we started with looks like an
[1:25:30] apple doesn't it even has a little womb
[1:25:31] in the middle and a womb really does
[1:25:34] have these these swirl forms around it
[1:25:36] you can actually see those kind of
[1:25:37] striations and living things in a
[1:25:39] womb there's a book on that that I can
[1:25:42] refer you to if you want this is um I've
[1:25:44] have a p i have a icosahedra in the
[1:25:47] middle but this is also the 35 knot it's
[1:25:49] got five points and three Crossings for
[1:25:51] each one
[1:25:54] so these are our baskets that we're
[1:25:56] weaving these are our reads these are
[1:25:58] our again from a Christian perspective
[1:26:00] this would be a crown of
[1:26:01] thorns um there's other names for these
[1:26:04] in in cabalistic literature they
[1:26:06] described as baskets where' they get
[1:26:08] them
[1:26:09] from well let's see I'll show you what
[1:26:11] Kito did first because you all know
[1:26:12] about Kito these are drawings of the
[1:26:16] procession of the
[1:26:19] planets these are tourist
[1:26:22] knots the one on
[1:26:25] top is Mars the one below is mercury
[1:26:28] Mars and
[1:26:30] Mercury um this one is Venus Mars and
[1:26:34] Jupiter
[1:26:35] together all Taurus
[1:26:38] knots and even
[1:26:41] better it's a paper that I was given by
[1:26:44] a fellow that I haven't spoken to in a
[1:26:46] while and I hope he doesn't mind my
[1:26:47] using it but it's a really fine work um
[1:26:49] fell lives down in San Jose named Terry
[1:26:51] Alden this is copyright Terry Alden 1991
[1:26:55] um and this is based on his theory that
[1:26:56] the Jupiter Saturn cycle was used as a
[1:26:58] verer to set the 25,000 year
[1:27:01] processional age and you might get in
[1:27:02] touch with him to find out about if
[1:27:03] people want know how to contact him I'll
[1:27:05] give you what I know of his address
[1:27:07] anyhow this is the Jupiter Saturn
[1:27:09] cycle it's the 1240 Taurus knot divide
[1:27:14] through by four and you get the 310
[1:27:18] knot this is the interactive cycle of
[1:27:20] Saturn and Jupiter in the heavens in the
[1:27:23] cosmos in the Dome of the heavens above
[1:27:27] the Flat
[1:27:29] Earth above the zodiacal
[1:27:32] plane and so all that they needed to
[1:27:36] design these models was to know how to
[1:27:38] weave baskets and to observe the
[1:27:41] heavens they had the
[1:27:43] technology imagine a model of the
[1:27:46] heavens a model of the hero's journey a
[1:27:48] model of the embryonic growth cycle all
[1:27:50] of it a meditational path in your mind
[1:27:54] talk about identifying with that which
[1:27:57] you're
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:08] studying I know nothing about the Hebrew
[1:28:11] alphabet I was wondering if I were to
[1:28:14] look in a modern
[1:28:18] Hebrew right will I you'll see the
[1:28:22] you'll see these you'll see these these
[1:28:24] style letters which are the letters I've
[1:28:26] used here these have been stylized and
[1:28:29] squared off the idea is that in in um
[1:28:32] writing a Torah scroll the standard of
[1:28:34] whether the scroll is acceptable is
[1:28:36] kosher is whether a small child can
[1:28:38] unambiguously read the letters letters
[1:28:40] here such as the V and the nun are too
[1:28:44] close and if they were drawn sloppily
[1:28:46] you could confuse them so what the
[1:28:48] rabbis did is to stylize the letters so
[1:28:51] they could could be unambiguously
[1:28:53] written
[1:28:55] these are the older forms these are the
[1:28:58] forms that are currently
[1:28:59] used but if you look in the dead C
[1:29:01] Scrolls you're going to find forms that
[1:29:03] look more like
[1:29:06] these
[1:29:07] okay anybody else yeah how certain are
[1:29:10] you that the uh those hand forms form
[1:29:13] the letters like did you do and how did
[1:29:14] you do that did you sort of experimented
[1:29:16] a lot experimented a lot took many years
[1:29:19] and I was trying at first to use a left
[1:29:21] hand you see when I say the morning
[1:29:22] prayers every morning I put it pilling
[1:29:24] strap on my left arm and I bind the
[1:29:26] strap on my hand so I thought it was my
[1:29:28] left hand that should make the letters
[1:29:30] but you can't do it you just can't I
[1:29:32] mean I tell you you could try it you
[1:29:33] can't get from one letter to another
[1:29:35] without doing these you know it doesn't
[1:29:37] work um it only works this way but no
[1:29:41] these are this is work in progress I
[1:29:43] would say you can trust two-thirds of
[1:29:45] these at this point worked on them long
[1:29:47] enough but there are some that I am
[1:29:49] suspicious of I am not certain of the
[1:29:51] final letters and I know the cough
[1:29:53] that's on the chart is wrong um but I
[1:29:56] haven't worked out exactly why it's the
[1:29:57] other one yet and so I have to leave the
[1:29:58] temporary one this is definitely work in
[1:30:00] progress and um we need to refine it
[1:30:02] more before it can be fully used but
[1:30:04] there's enough here to play with to work
[1:30:06] with if you want to experience some of
[1:30:08] this for yourself you don't really need
[1:30:10] the models we're going to make them
[1:30:11] available um but just lie down in a dark
[1:30:14] room sometime maybe you're going to go
[1:30:16] to sleep and move your hands
[1:30:18] around and notice you'll be able to see
[1:30:20] them even if it's completely dark room
[1:30:21] or your eyes are closed and if you've
[1:30:23] got used to making various gestures put
[1:30:26] your hands at your sides and visualize
[1:30:28] that you're moving your hands now do it
[1:30:31] carefully humility is very important in
[1:30:33] doing these things that way you don't
[1:30:34] get in trouble um but you can learn
[1:30:36] something you can have an experience
[1:30:37] from that we are said by people like
[1:30:40] costan and I think the talid says it
[1:30:42] also if you want to have lucid dreams
[1:30:43] look at your hand in your
[1:30:45] dream this is the
[1:30:47] dream we look at our hand here in order
[1:30:50] to wake
[1:30:51] up right
[1:30:55] okay please has there been in
[1:30:58] correlation with yogic positions in uh I
[1:31:02] haven't done the work um my answer is
[1:31:05] I'm pretty sure when we've got this
[1:31:06] refined we're going to find lots of
[1:31:08] correlations but I haven't done any of
[1:31:09] the work yet and do you have any
[1:31:11] suspicions as to what that might lead to
[1:31:14] as far as uh physical
[1:31:18] um uh ritual or if you look if you um
[1:31:24] you look a little younger than I am but
[1:31:25] I remember the 1950s they had these Aram
[1:31:28] Murray Dance Studios and what they would
[1:31:30] do is they teach you to do the Walts or
[1:31:32] the chaa if you didn't choke on it by
[1:31:34] they literally paint um footprints on
[1:31:36] the ballroom floor and you'd step into
[1:31:38] the stupid Footprints until you stumbled
[1:31:41] but You' learn to do the Walts the
[1:31:43] letters are like Footprints in your
[1:31:46] mind if you can do the exercise you will
[1:31:50] have the experience spiritual experience
[1:31:52] is ineffable you can't describe it in
[1:31:54] words so a sacred text that's just a
[1:31:57] story can only tell you that some
[1:31:59] Prophet might have existed and might
[1:32:00] have had an experience but what he
[1:32:01] experienced who knows but a text that's
[1:32:03] a formal language a language that
[1:32:06] specifies motion not only motion of your
[1:32:08] hands or dance outside but emotion you
[1:32:10] can also see
[1:32:12] feel that's a
[1:32:14] yoga you you follow that path and do
[1:32:17] that dance and your Consciousness will
[1:32:19] change there is an a quote that I I
[1:32:22] typed up I didn't bring the quotation
[1:32:24] this is very important this is from a
[1:32:26] book on
[1:32:28] mathematics um here it is this is from
[1:32:30] VI Arnold it's quoted from his book
[1:32:32] catastrophe Theory it's a springer verog
[1:32:34] page 26 I think you can get it Cody it's
[1:32:36] not worth it for this this one line the
[1:32:39] he this is a story of catastrophe theory
[1:32:41] part of Chaos Theory modern mathematics
[1:32:43] and he gets to this point where he says
[1:32:45] for instance it has been suggested that
[1:32:47] different phones of speech are different
[1:32:50] attractors of a sound producing
[1:32:52] dynamical system
[1:32:54] when you put a smile on your face it's
[1:32:57] been demonstrated you produce certain
[1:33:00] neurotransmitters that make you feel
[1:33:03] better it can't be a snide smile it's
[1:33:05] got to be a genuine smile so you can't
[1:33:07] Fake It Anyway the point is that when
[1:33:09] you do certain
[1:33:11] things it feels a certain way and when
[1:33:14] you make a sound or move your hand to
[1:33:16] relieve attention then you're
[1:33:18] dissipating that energy in that motion
[1:33:20] you're transforming it from a psychic
[1:33:22] state to a physical state or vice versa
[1:33:25] makes sense so that if you went through
[1:33:27] a sequence of feelings or visualizations
[1:33:29] and coordinated with a dance with motion
[1:33:31] with breathing with chanting with the
[1:33:33] whole gamut then you make yourself part
[1:33:37] of what you're discussing what you're
[1:33:39] describing you make yourself part of
[1:33:40] this process of life this transcendental
[1:33:43] process you stretch yourself Between
[1:33:45] Heaven and Earth um the rabbis teach
[1:33:48] that the only connection between hakma
[1:33:50] and Bina hakma being internal wisdom
[1:33:52] Bina being external understanding are
[1:33:55] the letters of the alphabet that's in
[1:33:56] kaplan's one of kaplan's books yeah yeah
[1:33:59] please
[1:34:01] um then have you played around with the
[1:34:05] different sizes of the letters in the
[1:34:08] Torah or some of the things like in
[1:34:10] numbers you have backwards Nos and stuff
[1:34:13] is that a reversal of the meditation is
[1:34:15] that lar smaller gestes don't know we
[1:34:19] our meu foundation is not very well
[1:34:22] funded um it's just basically the people
[1:34:25] that are in this room that are doing the
[1:34:26] work myself my wife Cynthia Bill Haber
[1:34:28] and Hannah araman who was over there I
[1:34:31] think um and we don't have the resources
[1:34:34] to do everything I have a stack in index
[1:34:36] of index cars about 3 feet high at this
[1:34:38] point four feet high whatever um of
[1:34:40] things that I should be checking out
[1:34:42] that you can't do everything so if you
[1:34:44] know anybody who wants to do some more
[1:34:46] of this work and will volunteer that's
[1:34:48] great we there's a lot of things to be
[1:34:49] checked out no I don't know I don't know
[1:34:51] how far the coding goes the the
[1:34:53] statistic test show it goes through all
[1:34:55] five books of Moses my indication is
[1:34:58] that there is definitely coding as far
[1:35:00] as the story of the Garden of Eden in
[1:35:02] Genesis and probably into the middle of
[1:35:04] Exodus but beyond that I don't know um
[1:35:07] it's my guess that Rabbi aka's
[1:35:09] meditation this is a guess this is a
[1:35:11] speculation I'm labeling that because I
[1:35:13] want to distinguish from what I've been
[1:35:14] telling you before which is pretty much
[1:35:16] stuff I'm I'm confident him I think that
[1:35:19] the pares meditation the one that takes
[1:35:21] you from here to where Messiah is
[1:35:24] this central point where the sun Su n
[1:35:29] resides is the sequence of letters from
[1:35:31] beginning of Genesis to the story of the
[1:35:33] Garden of Eden to Parise Parise Paradise
[1:35:36] Garden of Eden same in Hebrew I'm not
[1:35:39] sure that's true and I can't do it yet
[1:35:40] because I don't know all the letters
[1:35:41] well enough but the models suggest
[1:35:45] that's the case the most common letter
[1:35:48] skip pattern that the statisticians have
[1:35:50] found in the texts of the Books of Moses
[1:35:52] is a skip of 49 or 50
[1:35:56] letters the column is 99 tetrahedral
[1:36:00] long 49 49 and one in the
[1:36:04] middle each of these hands is 49
[1:36:07] tetrahedr long with one at the tip if
[1:36:11] you wrote the Torah out on this scroll
[1:36:15] toras are written on
[1:36:16] Scrolls then the letters that form these
[1:36:19] 49 letter patterns would line up in
[1:36:21] concentric circles like jewels on a
[1:36:24] egg now wait a minute that's not so
[1:36:26] farfetched oh I didn't bring the little
[1:36:28] model I always forget one model you know
[1:36:30] in the ancient world in the Roman and
[1:36:31] Greek world if you wanted to send a
[1:36:32] secret message to your
[1:36:34] general you'd take a rod shaft and you'd
[1:36:39] wrap it with a leather
[1:36:41] strap and you'd write across the
[1:36:43] windings your message and you'd pull the
[1:36:46] rod out and unfurl the strap and you'd
[1:36:47] have garbled letters the only way you
[1:36:49] can put it back together again is to
[1:36:52] wind it on the similar diameter
[1:36:55] shaft so we know that they use this
[1:36:58] system of winding winding on a shaft
[1:37:00] wait a minute looks like a shaft with
[1:37:02] windings on it to me huh um winding on a
[1:37:05] shaft was a technology that they used
[1:37:08] for coating if we didn't use an ordinary
[1:37:10] shaft but used this shaft and wrote the
[1:37:14] Torah on it that would encode it and
[1:37:17] maybe they started from this pattern of
[1:37:19] letters that then got interleaved
[1:37:21] interleaved woven embroidered let me
[1:37:25] read you that quotation that was the
[1:37:26] last
[1:37:27] quotation let's put this
[1:37:30] away going to find the quotation of
[1:37:32] course here it
[1:37:34] is this is from AR kaplan's translation
[1:37:37] of
[1:37:38] Exodus a living Torah it's a perfectly
[1:37:40] standard kosher Orthodox Jewish
[1:37:42] translation you'll find it in King James
[1:37:45] too I'm sure Exodus 3530 to35 Moses said
[1:37:50] this is in in Exodus where he's talking
[1:37:51] about building the Tabernacle Moses said
[1:37:54] to the Israelites God has selected Beto
[1:37:56] son of erri son of herur of the tribe of
[1:37:58] Judah and has filled him with Divine
[1:38:00] Spirit of wisdom understanding and
[1:38:02] knowledge hakina
[1:38:05] and which is on another level three
[1:38:08] levels three
[1:38:11] levels uh and a talent for all types of
[1:38:13] craftsmanship he will thus be able to
[1:38:15] devise
[1:38:17] plans makeup plans work in Gold Silver
[1:38:20] and copper cut stone stones to be set
[1:38:22] and do carp and other skilled work the
[1:38:25] words in Hebrew for Gold Silver and
[1:38:27] copper the word for silver means the
[1:38:30] palm of the hand the word for gold is
[1:38:33] the same as this Golden Sun point this
[1:38:36] seed in the center golden grain sun is
[1:38:38] golden the word for Sil for copper is
[1:38:41] the same as the word for snake there's
[1:38:43] the snake gold and silver and Brass so
[1:38:46] betel is making a tabernacle I showed
[1:38:48] you the ark picture out of gold and
[1:38:51] silver and Brass out of this projective
[1:38:53] principle
[1:38:54] and then it says in the next section God
[1:38:57] also gave to him in the oh ohol leav son
[1:39:00] of akis samak of the tribe of Don the
[1:39:04] ability to teach others he has granted
[1:39:07] them a natural talent for all
[1:39:08] craftsmanship to form materials to
[1:39:11] brocade to embroider patterns with sky
[1:39:15] blue dark red and Crimson wool and fine
[1:39:17] L linen and to weave they will thus be
[1:39:20] able to do all the necessary work in
[1:39:22] planning that's it those are the skills
[1:39:25] required to make the model simple
[1:39:27] carpentry weaving
[1:39:32] embroidering
[1:39:35] okay um next
[1:39:37] question uh can't quite see the page
[1:39:40] that embeds Arthur Young's Sevenfold in
[1:39:44] in the nine and I'm wondering if you're
[1:39:47] uh
[1:39:49] correlating particular letters of the I
[1:39:52] am what I'm doing is saying what Arthur
[1:39:54] is shown is that there's a turn that
[1:39:56] there's this Progressive sequence where
[1:39:58] there's a goal projected and a goal
[1:39:59] attained moves by charge uses charge to
[1:40:02] move takes on a center throws off
[1:40:03] centers there's a symmetry to that I'm
[1:40:07] saying the goal projected is this
[1:40:09] birthing breaking open the first
[1:40:12] distinction the goal attained is head
[1:40:15] encompassment closure logically the same
[1:40:18] relationship see what I'm saying
[1:40:21] Breaking open and encircling are exactly
[1:40:24] the same symmetrical relationship as
[1:40:26] goal projected and goal attained
[1:40:28] likewise after you open in a natural
[1:40:31] sequence follows the same logical order
[1:40:33] you have relationship the camel the
[1:40:35] gimmel the action opposite relationship
[1:40:38] action within limits on the other side
[1:40:41] we have projection uses charge to move
[1:40:44] projection same logical relationship
[1:40:47] here takes on its own Center here throws
[1:40:50] off centers throws off centers is like
[1:40:52] multiplying like a SE shell opening up
[1:40:54] layer on layer spiral on
[1:40:56] spiral takes on its own Center is just
[1:40:59] like the Delta it has the river coming
[1:41:01] down the center and it spreads that
[1:41:03] around it it makes its own Center
[1:41:06] defines its own Center so you can do
[1:41:09] this in many different ways and you have
[1:41:10] to go through it lots of times to in
[1:41:12] order to get it to match up to get the
[1:41:13] right sense of it but it's really no
[1:41:15] different than what Arthur I I hope I'm
[1:41:17] not mistaking it did over here by
[1:41:18] putting these these other names on these
[1:41:20] functions on the Rosetta Stone I mean um
[1:41:24] there's very good reasons for
[1:41:28] associating ml^ 2 t^2 with work or fact
[1:41:33] there's very good reasons for
[1:41:34] associating the um ml^ s over T function
[1:41:37] with action or
[1:41:39] impulse at first glance you wouldn't
[1:41:42] know to do that but if you think it
[1:41:43] through this is this is very logical and
[1:41:46] it it Maps the same way and you'll have
[1:41:50] to trust I did my work if you want more
[1:41:51] details you have to come over and we'll
[1:41:52] talk
[1:41:54] okay what I'm still curious what the
[1:41:58] what are the mechanics you go through to
[1:41:59] try to uh uh to find to find this match
[1:42:02] I mean do you have to put in vowels no I
[1:42:06] have paid no attention to the vowels nor
[1:42:08] to the word divisions nor to the
[1:42:09] cancellation marks because as far as we
[1:42:11] know the original text didn't have
[1:42:13] vowels didn't have word divisions didn't
[1:42:15] have cancellation marks however I'm
[1:42:18] certain that when they did add these
[1:42:19] extra layers they enhanced the
[1:42:22] definition and we'll learn more when we
[1:42:24] do examine them I just haven't done it
[1:42:27] the sequence as it exists on all you
[1:42:29] look at Dead Sea Scrolls it's just all
[1:42:30] run together and there's no vowels and
[1:42:32] there's there's nothing and you have to
[1:42:34] know what you can't tell where words end
[1:42:36] unless you introduce the final letters
[1:42:37] in Hebrew there's five letters that have
[1:42:39] final forms if you see them you know you
[1:42:41] have the end of a word but the final
[1:42:43] letters are weren't used in the old I
[1:42:46] script they were added after the
[1:42:48] Babylonian exile or reconstructed from
[1:42:50] what was originally there in Moses time
[1:42:52] that's an op
[1:42:54] debate
[1:42:56] so this is a result of a kind of
[1:42:58] distillation process over the last J
[1:43:01] it's 15 years now almost I mean it's
[1:43:03] been since 198 it's 11 years full-time
[1:43:06] and I've been doing this since
[1:43:07] 1968 so it's a distillation process well
[1:43:11] have you for instance written written
[1:43:13] down the Torah this part that you think
[1:43:15] is
[1:43:16] um based on this i' I've looked at the
[1:43:20] first so to place it uh you know leaving
[1:43:23] gaps if you had to uh so to place it
[1:43:28] in um you know going every 49th or
[1:43:31] whatever no I didn't do that work that
[1:43:32] work was done by statisticians at UCLA
[1:43:35] and later at Hebrew University um and
[1:43:37] that's published work if you want give
[1:43:39] me a call during the week and I send you
[1:43:40] a copy of some of it you can look at it
[1:43:43] um my guess is that these are tenard
[1:43:45] statisticians with reputations as good
[1:43:47] mathematicians so their math is probably
[1:43:49] good their philosophy is thin because
[1:43:52] they're jump to conclusions that are
[1:43:54] unwarranted but the math is good as far
[1:43:56] as I
[1:43:57] know I didn't do that I wonder if you
[1:44:01] found anything in the current recent
[1:44:04] Revelations of Dead Sea Scrolls that fit
[1:44:08] into your theories in in a meaningful
[1:44:11] way I haven't examined the de C Scrolls
[1:44:13] uh in any great detail myself my
[1:44:15] understanding of the stories is that
[1:44:17] they either presage or Echo the gospel
[1:44:19] stories to a large degree and there's a
[1:44:22] lot of relig just debates about what
[1:44:24] that means and what its significance is
[1:44:26] they also seem to say that U Judaism was
[1:44:28] much more varied than we think it was um
[1:44:31] and which we know is the case there were
[1:44:32] all kinds of individual groups that were
[1:44:35] doing their own thing at that time my
[1:44:37] guess is that we're not going to
[1:44:39] understand the meaning of the
[1:44:40] allegorical discussions in the Dead Sea
[1:44:42] Scrolls any better than we understand
[1:44:44] the meaning of the allegorical
[1:44:45] discussions in calistic texts until we
[1:44:48] apply some of these mathematical models
[1:44:50] to those texts but I I haven't done it
[1:44:54] it should be done S one particular point
[1:44:57] of view let me see if I have it right
[1:44:59] what you're suggesting is that if indeed
[1:45:02] um what was going on with the formation
[1:45:05] of of the language and the way it was
[1:45:06] put together and it's taken in in its
[1:45:10] original meaning that the reading of it
[1:45:12] correctly will induce an ontological
[1:45:14] shift yes in terms of Consciousness and
[1:45:17] will be tantamount to arriving at a
[1:45:19] point of view or a belon Shong a
[1:45:22] participatory one in which which would
[1:45:24] essentially be that which was meant by
[1:45:26] the coming of the Messiah yes if I'm
[1:45:28] right Moses comes down from my sin and
[1:45:31] writes down his experience in this
[1:45:33] formal language he describes step by
[1:45:37] step the dance God puts him through and
[1:45:40] if we can step into Moses's shoes so to
[1:45:44] speak I know he takes his shoes off but
[1:45:45] step into his shoes and the artham
[1:45:47] Murray Dance sense into the letters he
[1:45:49] writes in his Torah then we will be
[1:45:51] present back at Mount
[1:45:53] which is what Judaism teaches but you
[1:45:56] have to go through the level the word
[1:45:58] level of the Torah there's four levels
[1:45:59] of the Torah and I know you know that
[1:46:01] but not everyone knows that um The
[1:46:03] Superficial level is the story which is
[1:46:05] what the fundamentalists believe um the
[1:46:07] next level is the discussion level
[1:46:09] so-called um no actually it's it's it's
[1:46:12] a hint level called
[1:46:13] remes um which is more details then
[1:46:16] there's a level called D which is
[1:46:18] discussion there is a statement here I
[1:46:20] didn't get to where one of the these
[1:46:22] commentators is saying the word Druid
[1:46:23] comes from the Hebrew word d they were
[1:46:25] roving Bic commentators who brought this
[1:46:27] Israelite teaching out of the Middle
[1:46:29] East and into northern Europe now I
[1:46:31] didn't get to that quote U and then the
[1:46:34] bottom level is s which means Foundation
[1:46:37] we're dealing I hope with the foundation
[1:46:39] level shot which is the simple level
[1:46:43] remes the hints D the discussion and S
[1:46:47] the foundation together spell pares if
[1:46:50] you integrate the four levels some could
[1:46:52] say the four dimensions of the Torah
[1:46:55] then you may have the experience um we
[1:46:58] are running out of time I wanted to get
[1:47:00] one thing in we're working on a little
[1:47:01] book that is going to give you the hand
[1:47:03] gestures on a full page each with
[1:47:05] descriptions and I'm hoping to make them
[1:47:07] available soon so people can practice
[1:47:09] with it so I just thought I'd show you
[1:47:10] the markup on it
[1:47:12] um also I didn't get back to pl's Cave
[1:47:16] Revisited which I'd wanted to but I will
[1:47:19] summarize the point of it basically he's
[1:47:22] saying that the tonic stories of Plato's
[1:47:24] Cave is also the story of the use of
[1:47:27] sacred geometry to initiate an ego death
[1:47:29] experience as the description of an ego
[1:47:31] death experience that if one doesn't
[1:47:34] have this self-abnegating experience at
[1:47:36] a very deep level one is
[1:47:40] not righteous enough one doesn't Reach
[1:47:42] This level a a a AIC a righteous person
[1:47:46] in Judaism is said to sacrifice them
[1:47:49] themselves to the great flame in their
[1:47:50] meditation every night before they go to
[1:47:52] sleep and then of course they're reborn
[1:47:54] Every Morning Sounds also familiar
[1:47:57] another death and Resurrection story u a
[1:48:00] person at the level uh I use the example
[1:48:02] because it's not so controversial of
[1:48:04] Mother Teresa a saintly person um sort
[1:48:07] of does that automatically they're at
[1:48:08] that level of humility they just they
[1:48:11] let go they just keep letting go all the
[1:48:13] time they don't play ego
[1:48:16] games so if you could integrate all the
[1:48:19] levels of the Torah um as it says at I
[1:48:23] um the people heard the
[1:48:28] visions and saw the sounds or something
[1:48:32] like that it was a case of synesthesia
[1:48:35] where the senses were mixed where they
[1:48:36] were all together it's at that level of
[1:48:39] abstraction that level of
[1:48:41] meditation we really are running out of
[1:48:43] time do we have time for one more
[1:48:44] question do you think one more okay um
[1:48:47] anybody all right you get it um you
[1:48:50] mentioned earlier about cage and and
[1:48:53] opium and I wondered if you speculated
[1:48:55] on the possible role of shamanic
[1:48:58] psychoactive shamanic medicines in uh
[1:49:02] sure the discovery or or experience
[1:49:04] visions of this type of
[1:49:07] thing I think it looks a little like a
[1:49:10] mushroom you take a mushroom into your
[1:49:12] mouth and the mushroom form blossoms in
[1:49:15] your
[1:49:17] mind um the Egyptians we know had or got
[1:49:22] them in from RoR got they also we think
[1:49:25] practice Suffocation rituals and these
[1:49:27] coffers which can induce near-death
[1:49:31] experiences um I'm sure that they had
[1:49:34] their own version of holotropic
[1:49:36] breathing um they definitely knew about
[1:49:38] ritual dancing and
[1:49:40] chanting um so yeah this is work in
[1:49:44] progress um and um there will be more
[1:49:48] please stay in touch with us we need all
[1:49:50] of your help if you've got questions or
[1:49:52] comments uh we want them um I think we
[1:49:56] better stop because we're going to run
[1:49:57] out of tape so I thank you all for
[1:49:59] coming um those of you who celebrate St
[1:50:02] Patrick's Day have an especially good
[1:50:04] one and um perhaps we'll do this again
[1:50:06] next year thank
[1:50:15] you well they seem to like it
[1:50:23] [Music]
[1:50:52] oh
[1:51:14] [Music]
