[00:30] Thank you all for coming. Um,
[00:33] Thank you all for coming. Um, this is a new presentation of new
[00:36] this is a new presentation of new
[00:36] this is a new presentation of new material and so I'm assuming that
[00:38] material and so I'm assuming that
[00:38] material and so I'm assuming that everyone is up to speed on all the old
[00:40] everyone is up to speed on all the old
[00:40] everyone is up to speed on all the old material.
[00:42] material.
[00:42] material. If that's not the case, we're going to
[00:43] If that's not the case, we're going to
[00:43] If that's not the case, we're going to do a very quick review, but we're not
[00:45] do a very quick review, but we're not
[00:45] do a very quick review, but we're not going to do um I'm not going to start
[00:46] going to do um I'm not going to start
[00:46] going to do um I'm not going to start from the beginning again because if I do
[00:48] from the beginning again because if I do
[00:48] from the beginning again because if I do that, we'll be here all night. And so
[00:50] that, we'll be here all night. And so
[00:50] that, we'll be here all night. And so this is new material. Also, I want to
[00:52] this is new material. Also, I want to
[00:52] this is new material. Also, I want to ask everyone to be a little patient. I'm
[00:55] ask everyone to be a little patient. I'm
[00:55] ask everyone to be a little patient. I'm going to do the hard troublesome math
[00:57] going to do the hard troublesome math
[00:58] going to do the hard troublesome math type stuff first and then get into the
[00:59] type stuff first and then get into the
[00:59] type stuff first and then get into the stuff that's easy to understand and new
[01:01] stuff that's easy to understand and new
[01:02] stuff that's easy to understand and new material later. So bear with it for a
[01:04] material later. So bear with it for a
[01:04] material later. So bear with it for a little while. But I do think it's worth
[01:05] little while. But I do think it's worth
[01:05] little while. But I do think it's worth updating what we've done before and um
[01:08] updating what we've done before and um
[01:08] updating what we've done before and um writing some of the intermediate things
[01:09] writing some of the intermediate things
[01:10] writing some of the intermediate things and then the new material.
[01:14] The the title of of the talk tonight is
[01:16] The the title of of the talk tonight is a matrix of meaning for sacred
[01:18] a matrix of meaning for sacred
[01:18] a matrix of meaning for sacred alphabets. And although I'm only going
[01:20] alphabets. And although I'm only going
[01:20] alphabets. And although I'm only going to be dealing with the Hebrew alphabet,
[01:22] to be dealing with the Hebrew alphabet,
[01:22] to be dealing with the Hebrew alphabet, what I'm saying appears to be true by
[01:24] what I'm saying appears to be true by
[01:24] what I'm saying appears to be true by and large for the Arabic and the Greek
[01:26] and large for the Arabic and the Greek
[01:26] and large for the Arabic and the Greek alphabet and in some related ways we
[01:28] alphabet and in some related ways we
[01:28] alphabet and in some related ways we think with some of the Eastern
[01:29] think with some of the Eastern
[01:29] think with some of the Eastern traditions as well, Tibetan perhaps, but
[01:32] traditions as well, Tibetan perhaps, but
[01:32] traditions as well, Tibetan perhaps, but I haven't done that work. Um, so I'm
[01:35] I haven't done that work. Um, so I'm
[01:35] I haven't done that work. Um, so I'm going to use the Hebrew. And we know
[01:37] going to use the Hebrew. And we know
[01:37] going to use the Hebrew. And we know that the Greek alphabet is related to
[01:39] that the Greek alphabet is related to
[01:39] that the Greek alphabet is related to the Hebrew and we know that the Arabic
[01:40] the Hebrew and we know that the Arabic
[01:40] the Hebrew and we know that the Arabic alphabet is related to the Hebrew. They
[01:42] alphabet is related to the Hebrew. They
[01:42] alphabet is related to the Hebrew. They both have the same numerological
[01:44] both have the same numerological
[01:44] both have the same numerological connection. A is one, alpha is one. I
[01:47] connection. A is one, alpha is one. I
[01:47] connection. A is one, alpha is one. I don't know what the Arabic name is, but
[01:49] don't know what the Arabic name is, but
[01:49] don't know what the Arabic name is, but the A letter is always one. And they all
[01:50] the A letter is always one. And they all
[01:50] the A letter is always one. And they all have the same numerical value. And you
[01:53] have the same numerical value. And you
[01:53] have the same numerical value. And you can parallel these alphabets. And they
[01:55] can parallel these alphabets. And they
[01:55] can parallel these alphabets. And they also have the same
[01:57] also have the same
[01:57] also have the same equivalent with English, except in
[01:58] equivalent with English, except in
[01:58] equivalent with English, except in English, we only have 26 letters. In
[02:00] English, we only have 26 letters. In
[02:00] English, we only have 26 letters. In Hebrew, they're 27 in the full alphabet.
[02:03] Hebrew, they're 27 in the full alphabet.
[02:03] Hebrew, they're 27 in the full alphabet. The letter that's missing is near the
[02:04] The letter that's missing is near the
[02:04] The letter that's missing is near the middle of the alphabet, and it's the one
[02:06] middle of the alphabet, and it's the one
[02:06] middle of the alphabet, and it's the one that I I use an English dollar sign for
[02:08] that I I use an English dollar sign for
[02:08] that I I use an English dollar sign for that. It doesn't have anything to do
[02:09] that. It doesn't have anything to do
[02:09] that. It doesn't have anything to do with a dollar sign. So I think the thing
[02:12] with a dollar sign. So I think the thing
[02:12] with a dollar sign. So I think the thing to do is for me to try to follow my
[02:14] to do is for me to try to follow my
[02:14] to do is for me to try to follow my outline which is very difficult for me
[02:16] outline which is very difficult for me
[02:16] outline which is very difficult for me to do and if we do that then we should
[02:19] to do and if we do that then we should
[02:19] to do and if we do that then we should be able to accomplish what I hope we can
[02:21] be able to accomplish what I hope we can
[02:21] be able to accomplish what I hope we can accomplish tonight. So thank you all for
[02:23] accomplish tonight. So thank you all for
[02:23] accomplish tonight. So thank you all for coming. Um this work is done on the
[02:25] coming. Um this work is done on the
[02:25] coming. Um this work is done on the under the opaces of the Meu Foundation
[02:27] under the opaces of the Meu Foundation
[02:27] under the opaces of the Meu Foundation which is a nonprofit foundation. Um some
[02:31] which is a nonprofit foundation. Um some
[02:31] which is a nonprofit foundation. Um some of the other people here can help you
[02:33] of the other people here can help you
[02:33] of the other people here can help you with information about what we're doing
[02:35] with information about what we're doing
[02:35] with information about what we're doing if you're curious. And there are
[02:37] if you're curious. And there are
[02:37] if you're curious. And there are videotapes of the old material and the
[02:40] videotapes of the old material and the
[02:40] videotapes of the old material and the update material. And we're making a new
[02:42] update material. And we're making a new
[02:42] update material. And we're making a new tape now for the new material. So if
[02:43] tape now for the new material. So if
[02:44] tape now for the new material. So if anyone wants to get caught up, there
[02:45] anyone wants to get caught up, there
[02:45] anyone wants to get caught up, there tapes available here and they're also at
[02:47] tapes available here and they're also at
[02:47] tapes available here and they're also at Cody's on Telegraph A.
[02:50] Cody's on Telegraph A.
[02:50] Cody's on Telegraph A. Okay. What we're going to do is we're
[02:52] Okay. What we're going to do is we're
[02:52] Okay. What we're going to do is we're going to rediscover the obvious. If it
[02:54] going to rediscover the obvious. If it
[02:54] going to rediscover the obvious. If it isn't going to turn out to be obvious
[02:55] isn't going to turn out to be obvious
[02:55] isn't going to turn out to be obvious when we're done, then it probably wasn't
[02:57] when we're done, then it probably wasn't
[02:57] when we're done, then it probably wasn't right. And so this is going to be a
[02:59] right. And so this is going to be a
[02:59] right. And so this is going to be a rediscovery of what it's hard to believe
[03:01] rediscovery of what it's hard to believe
[03:01] rediscovery of what it's hard to believe isn't known. Um I certainly find it hard
[03:04] isn't known. Um I certainly find it hard
[03:04] isn't known. Um I certainly find it hard to believe that some of these ideas are
[03:05] to believe that some of these ideas are
[03:06] to believe that some of these ideas are not known. at least the bottom line
[03:07] not known. at least the bottom line
[03:07] not known. at least the bottom line ideas we'll get to at the end. We're
[03:09] ideas we'll get to at the end. We're
[03:09] ideas we'll get to at the end. We're going to be talking about
[03:12] going to be talking about
[03:12] going to be talking about how we generate letters of the alphabet
[03:14] how we generate letters of the alphabet
[03:14] how we generate letters of the alphabet and we're going to be talking about the
[03:16] and we're going to be talking about the
[03:16] and we're going to be talking about the meaning of sacred alphabets and their
[03:18] meaning of sacred alphabets and their
[03:18] meaning of sacred alphabets and their relationship to both the physical world
[03:20] relationship to both the physical world
[03:20] relationship to both the physical world and to the spiritual world and that's
[03:23] and to the spiritual world and that's
[03:23] and to the spiritual world and that's the primary model the relationship of
[03:25] the primary model the relationship of
[03:25] the primary model the relationship of the two parts of reality. We exist in an
[03:28] the two parts of reality. We exist in an
[03:28] the two parts of reality. We exist in an external reality, physical reality and
[03:31] external reality, physical reality and
[03:31] external reality, physical reality and we have an internal reality, our
[03:33] we have an internal reality, our
[03:33] we have an internal reality, our consciousness. Um, inside is our
[03:35] consciousness. Um, inside is our
[03:35] consciousness. Um, inside is our consciousness, outside is the physical
[03:37] consciousness, outside is the physical
[03:37] consciousness, outside is the physical world. And that relationship between
[03:39] world. And that relationship between
[03:39] world. And that relationship between inside and outside is the basis for this
[03:41] inside and outside is the basis for this
[03:41] inside and outside is the basis for this whole presentation. In fact, that's the
[03:43] whole presentation. In fact, that's the
[03:44] whole presentation. In fact, that's the first letter of the text of Genesis is
[03:45] first letter of the text of Genesis is
[03:46] first letter of the text of Genesis is the letter B. And the letter B stands
[03:48] the letter B. And the letter B stands
[03:48] the letter B. And the letter B stands for the distinction between inside and
[03:50] for the distinction between inside and
[03:50] for the distinction between inside and outside. It means a house. And we'll get
[03:52] outside. It means a house. And we'll get
[03:52] outside. It means a house. And we'll get into some of that as we go on.
[03:55] into some of that as we go on.
[03:55] into some of that as we go on. Um we're going to talk about not only um
[03:57] Um we're going to talk about not only um
[03:57] Um we're going to talk about not only um some of these forms which many of you
[03:59] some of these forms which many of you
[03:59] some of these forms which many of you have seen over the years but now finally
[04:01] have seen over the years but now finally
[04:01] have seen over the years but now finally I'm going to try to identify some of
[04:03] I'm going to try to identify some of
[04:03] I'm going to try to identify some of these forms um a little better. Um,
[04:06] these forms um a little better. Um,
[04:06] these forms um a little better. Um, we've gone through in the past what
[04:08] we've gone through in the past what
[04:08] we've gone through in the past what happened when we uh attempted to look at
[04:12] happened when we uh attempted to look at
[04:12] happened when we uh attempted to look at the beginning of Genesis in Hebrew.
[04:14] the beginning of Genesis in Hebrew.
[04:14] the beginning of Genesis in Hebrew. And what we found is I'm not going to I
[04:17] And what we found is I'm not going to I
[04:17] And what we found is I'm not going to I didn't bring the the the large posters
[04:19] didn't bring the the the large posters
[04:19] didn't bring the the the large posters for that, but this pyramid shaped
[04:22] for that, but this pyramid shaped
[04:22] for that, but this pyramid shaped object, as you can see, has letters that
[04:25] object, as you can see, has letters that
[04:25] object, as you can see, has letters that are all paired up. Some of the letters
[04:27] are all paired up. Some of the letters
[04:27] are all paired up. Some of the letters aren't the same, and we'll talk about
[04:28] aren't the same, and we'll talk about
[04:28] aren't the same, and we'll talk about that, too. These are the letters of the
[04:31] that, too. These are the letters of the
[04:31] that, too. These are the letters of the Hebrew text of Genesis, the first verse.
[04:34] Hebrew text of Genesis, the first verse.
[04:34] Hebrew text of Genesis, the first verse. And all that's happened here is we've
[04:35] And all that's happened here is we've
[04:35] And all that's happened here is we've taken the first verse which should be up
[04:37] taken the first verse which should be up
[04:37] taken the first verse which should be up on the wall and this you've seen from
[04:40] on the wall and this you've seen from
[04:40] on the wall and this you've seen from before. We recognized it as the first
[04:42] before. We recognized it as the first
[04:42] before. We recognized it as the first natural unit of the text and we took um
[04:46] natural unit of the text and we took um
[04:46] natural unit of the text and we took um Carlos Suarez and other cobalists
[04:50] Carlos Suarez and other cobalists
[04:50] Carlos Suarez and other cobalists opinion literally. Um the teaching is
[04:53] opinion literally. Um the teaching is
[04:53] opinion literally. Um the teaching is that the secret of the whole universe of
[04:55] that the secret of the whole universe of
[04:55] that the secret of the whole universe of everything we could ever know is in the
[04:56] everything we could ever know is in the
[04:56] everything we could ever know is in the first letter of the sacred text. But if
[04:59] first letter of the sacred text. But if
[04:59] first letter of the sacred text. But if you can't figure it out from the first
[05:00] you can't figure it out from the first
[05:00] you can't figure it out from the first letter, it's repeated in greater detail
[05:03] letter, it's repeated in greater detail
[05:03] letter, it's repeated in greater detail in the first word. If you can't figure
[05:05] in the first word. If you can't figure
[05:05] in the first word. If you can't figure it out from the first word, it's
[05:06] it out from the first word, it's
[05:06] it out from the first word, it's repeated in greater detail in the first
[05:08] repeated in greater detail in the first
[05:08] repeated in greater detail in the first verse and the first day and the first
[05:09] verse and the first day and the first
[05:09] verse and the first day and the first week and etc. Um, a description of a
[05:13] week and etc. Um, a description of a
[05:13] week and etc. Um, a description of a hierarchical system. Well, obviously
[05:15] hierarchical system. Well, obviously
[05:15] hierarchical system. Well, obviously when I started this, it wasn't too easy
[05:18] when I started this, it wasn't too easy
[05:18] when I started this, it wasn't too easy to figure out the secret from the first
[05:19] to figure out the secret from the first
[05:19] to figure out the secret from the first letter, but now it becomes clear why the
[05:22] letter, but now it becomes clear why the
[05:22] letter, but now it becomes clear why the first letter has to be B. And that B
[05:25] first letter has to be B. And that B
[05:25] first letter has to be B. And that B stands for a container, for a box, for a
[05:27] stands for a container, for a box, for a
[05:27] stands for a container, for a box, for a house. the distinction between inside
[05:29] house. the distinction between inside
[05:29] house. the distinction between inside and outside. And then what we did with
[05:31] and outside. And then what we did with
[05:31] and outside. And then what we did with it with this sequence of Hebrew letters
[05:34] it with this sequence of Hebrew letters
[05:34] it with this sequence of Hebrew letters is we noticed these patterns, which I've
[05:36] is we noticed these patterns, which I've
[05:36] is we noticed these patterns, which I've talked about before, and I'm not going
[05:37] talked about before, and I'm not going
[05:37] talked about before, and I'm not going to get into. We notice that the initial
[05:39] to get into. We notice that the initial
[05:39] to get into. We notice that the initial B and the final Z, I'll use the English
[05:41] B and the final Z, I'll use the English
[05:42] B and the final Z, I'll use the English names for the letters. They're they're
[05:43] names for the letters. They're they're
[05:43] names for the letters. They're they're equivalent. Um, form a big olive, a big
[05:46] equivalent. Um, form a big olive, a big
[05:46] equivalent. Um, form a big olive, a big A. And so it's as if the head and tail
[05:49] A. And so it's as if the head and tail
[05:49] A. And so it's as if the head and tail of this snake that eats its tail comes
[05:51] of this snake that eats its tail comes
[05:51] of this snake that eats its tail comes back on itself. And as we've seen
[05:53] back on itself. And as we've seen
[05:53] back on itself. And as we've seen before, it forms this toidal loop.
[05:57] before, it forms this toidal loop.
[05:57] before, it forms this toidal loop. In fact, that's what this pattern does.
[06:00] In fact, that's what this pattern does.
[06:00] In fact, that's what this pattern does. This little pyramid-shaped object, which
[06:01] This little pyramid-shaped object, which
[06:01] This little pyramid-shaped object, which is shaped this way for mathematical
[06:03] is shaped this way for mathematical
[06:03] is shaped this way for mathematical reasons,
[06:05] reasons,
[06:05] reasons, basically correlates the same letters
[06:08] basically correlates the same letters
[06:08] basically correlates the same letters with themselves as you curl around the
[06:10] with themselves as you curl around the
[06:10] with themselves as you curl around the first verse. You can think of sort of a
[06:11] first verse. You can think of sort of a
[06:12] first verse. You can think of sort of a bead chain with each letter being on a
[06:14] bead chain with each letter being on a
[06:14] bead chain with each letter being on a bead. And you can curl the chain around
[06:16] bead. And you can curl the chain around
[06:16] bead. And you can curl the chain around so the same letters line up. That's all
[06:18] so the same letters line up. That's all
[06:18] so the same letters line up. That's all I've done here. Um, this pattern is so
[06:21] I've done here. Um, this pattern is so
[06:21] I've done here. Um, this pattern is so strong that correlates the letters at
[06:23] strong that correlates the letters at
[06:24] strong that correlates the letters at the beginning of Genesis that you could
[06:25] the beginning of Genesis that you could
[06:25] the beginning of Genesis that you could uniquely replace a letter if it had been
[06:27] uniquely replace a letter if it had been
[06:27] uniquely replace a letter if it had been miscopied, which would have been a
[06:29] miscopied, which would have been a
[06:29] miscopied, which would have been a horrible tragedy of course from
[06:31] horrible tragedy of course from
[06:31] horrible tragedy of course from religious point of view by just
[06:32] religious point of view by just
[06:32] religious point of view by just reference to the other letters of the
[06:34] reference to the other letters of the
[06:34] reference to the other letters of the first verse. It's that deeply
[06:36] first verse. It's that deeply
[06:36] first verse. It's that deeply self-reerential. It's that deeply
[06:38] self-reerential. It's that deeply
[06:38] self-reerential. It's that deeply autocorrelated is that strong a pattern.
[06:40] autocorrelated is that strong a pattern.
[06:40] autocorrelated is that strong a pattern. But it's important now for us to try to
[06:42] But it's important now for us to try to
[06:42] But it's important now for us to try to figure out what these patterns
[06:44] figure out what these patterns
[06:44] figure out what these patterns represent.
[06:46] represent.
[06:46] represent. And what we found before that they
[06:49] And what we found before that they
[06:49] And what we found before that they represented was a way of generating the
[06:51] represented was a way of generating the
[06:51] represented was a way of generating the Hebrew alphabet. And that's what um the
[06:53] Hebrew alphabet. And that's what um the
[06:54] Hebrew alphabet. And that's what um the basis of the previous work has been. And
[06:56] basis of the previous work has been. And
[06:56] basis of the previous work has been. And so what we want to do now is expand on
[06:58] so what we want to do now is expand on
[06:58] so what we want to do now is expand on that and find out how that works and
[06:59] that and find out how that works and
[06:59] that and find out how that works and what else it implies.
[07:02] what else it implies.
[07:02] what else it implies. We're going to be talking about some
[07:03] We're going to be talking about some
[07:03] We're going to be talking about some mathematical objects um besides Arthur
[07:06] mathematical objects um besides Arthur
[07:06] mathematical objects um besides Arthur Young's seven cycle,
[07:09] Young's seven cycle,
[07:09] Young's seven cycle, the turn, the reflexive turn. We're also
[07:11] the turn, the reflexive turn. We're also
[07:12] the turn, the reflexive turn. We're also going to be talking about material that
[07:13] going to be talking about material that
[07:13] going to be talking about material that book Mr. Fuller mentions. Um we're going
[07:15] book Mr. Fuller mentions. Um we're going
[07:15] book Mr. Fuller mentions. Um we're going to be talking about the Penrose Twister.
[07:17] to be talking about the Penrose Twister.
[07:17] to be talking about the Penrose Twister. We'll mention that. Um some
[07:19] We'll mention that. Um some
[07:19] We'll mention that. Um some hyperdimensional objects and some
[07:21] hyperdimensional objects and some
[07:21] hyperdimensional objects and some reasons for why we would want to be

[07:27] objects.
[07:27] objects. Okay.
[07:29] Okay.
[07:29] Okay. The most important idea to keep in mind
[07:32] The most important idea to keep in mind
[07:32] The most important idea to keep in mind is that everything that we're going to
[07:34] is that everything that we're going to
[07:34] is that everything that we're going to be doing here is going to be based on
[07:36] be doing here is going to be based on
[07:36] be doing here is going to be based on the lowest order, the simplest, the most
[07:40] the lowest order, the simplest, the most
[07:40] the lowest order, the simplest, the most direct representation we can have.
[07:41] direct representation we can have.
[07:42] direct representation we can have. That's the only one we can count on to
[07:43] That's the only one we can count on to
[07:43] That's the only one we can count on to be universal. If as is claimed, these
[07:47] be universal. If as is claimed, these
[07:47] be universal. If as is claimed, these sacred alphabets, the Hebrew alphabet is
[07:49] sacred alphabets, the Hebrew alphabet is
[07:49] sacred alphabets, the Hebrew alphabet is a universal language, a universal
[07:51] a universal language, a universal
[07:51] a universal language, a universal alphabet, then if a high order effect
[07:55] alphabet, then if a high order effect
[07:55] alphabet, then if a high order effect had been picked, it wouldn't be
[07:56] had been picked, it wouldn't be
[07:56] had been picked, it wouldn't be universal. It couldn't be intrinsic. it
[07:58] universal. It couldn't be intrinsic. it
[07:58] universal. It couldn't be intrinsic. it couldn't be rediscovered independently
[08:00] couldn't be rediscovered independently
[08:00] couldn't be rediscovered independently other places. But if we pick the most
[08:02] other places. But if we pick the most
[08:02] other places. But if we pick the most elegant situation, that's a unique
[08:04] elegant situation, that's a unique
[08:04] elegant situation, that's a unique situation and that's the one that we're
[08:06] situation and that's the one that we're
[08:06] situation and that's the one that we're going to be looking for. And the
[08:10] going to be looking for. And the
[08:10] going to be looking for. And the highest ideal we're going to be looking
[08:11] highest ideal we're going to be looking
[08:11] highest ideal we're going to be looking at, what we think we're looking at here
[08:13] at, what we think we're looking at here
[08:13] at, what we think we're looking at here in the terms of the Hebrew alphabet and
[08:15] in the terms of the Hebrew alphabet and
[08:15] in the terms of the Hebrew alphabet and in terms of the text of Genesis is the
[08:19] in terms of the text of Genesis is the
[08:19] in terms of the text of Genesis is the single most deeply self-mbed, most
[08:22] single most deeply self-mbed, most
[08:22] single most deeply self-mbed, most deeply reflexive, if you will, most
[08:24] deeply reflexive, if you will, most
[08:24] deeply reflexive, if you will, most deeply self- embedded system that is
[08:26] deeply self- embedded system that is
[08:26] deeply self- embedded system that is possible.
[08:28] possible.
[08:28] possible. Now, if I were to tell you that I had
[08:31] Now, if I were to tell you that I had
[08:31] Now, if I were to tell you that I had the truth with a big T and it was in a
[08:33] the truth with a big T and it was in a
[08:34] the truth with a big T and it was in a religious context, you would sort of
[08:35] religious context, you would sort of
[08:35] religious context, you would sort of walk away and say, "Oh, yeah, another
[08:37] walk away and say, "Oh, yeah, another
[08:37] walk away and say, "Oh, yeah, another guy knows the truth." But if I told you
[08:39] guy knows the truth." But if I told you
[08:39] guy knows the truth." But if I told you that I had a truth and I talked about
[08:42] that I had a truth and I talked about
[08:42] that I had a truth and I talked about the digits in pi, then you wouldn't have
[08:44] the digits in pi, then you wouldn't have
[08:44] the digits in pi, then you wouldn't have a pro problem with that. Everyone knows
[08:46] a pro problem with that. Everyone knows
[08:46] a pro problem with that. Everyone knows that pi is a fundamental truth of this
[08:48] that pi is a fundamental truth of this
[08:48] that pi is a fundamental truth of this reality. The relationship of the radius
[08:50] reality. The relationship of the radius
[08:50] reality. The relationship of the radius to the circumference of a circle. This
[08:52] to the circumference of a circle. This
[08:52] to the circumference of a circle. This is a fundamental of our reality.
[08:55] is a fundamental of our reality.
[08:55] is a fundamental of our reality. That's why we're going for the most
[08:57] That's why we're going for the most
[08:57] That's why we're going for the most deeply self-mbed, the most deeply
[09:00] deeply self-mbed, the most deeply
[09:00] deeply self-mbed, the most deeply reflexive system, a representation of
[09:02] reflexive system, a representation of
[09:02] reflexive system, a representation of that. Because if we go for that extreme,
[09:06] that. Because if we go for that extreme,
[09:06] that. Because if we go for that extreme, then we can have truth with a big T
[09:09] then we can have truth with a big T
[09:09] then we can have truth with a big T without getting into theological
[09:10] without getting into theological
[09:10] without getting into theological discussions, which really don't belong
[09:12] discussions, which really don't belong
[09:12] discussions, which really don't belong here, I don't think.
[09:14] here, I don't think.
[09:14] here, I don't think. And the the primary form that we're
[09:16] And the the primary form that we're
[09:16] And the the primary form that we're going to be looking for, um, which I'm
[09:18] going to be looking for, um, which I'm
[09:18] going to be looking for, um, which I'm going to tell you about as we go along,
[09:20] going to tell you about as we go along,
[09:20] going to tell you about as we go along, is going to be this form. And I'll tell
[09:23] is going to be this form. And I'll tell
[09:23] is going to be this form. And I'll tell you its name ahead of time so that as we
[09:26] you its name ahead of time so that as we

[09:27] go through this you'll get a sense of
[09:27] go through this you'll get a sense of where I'm going with all this. I'm
[09:29] where I'm going with all this. I'm
[09:29] where I'm going with all this. I'm calling this form naked recursion.
[09:34] calling this form naked recursion.
[09:34] calling this form naked recursion. The idea is it's naked because it is

[10:10] fundamental part of it. And then we're
[10:10] fundamental part of it. And then we're going to identify what this is. As you
[10:11] going to identify what this is. As you
[10:12] going to identify what this is. As you know from before, let's let's just do
[10:14] know from before, let's let's just do
[10:14] know from before, let's let's just do that so we don't make a big secret of
[10:15] that so we don't make a big secret of
[10:15] that so we don't make a big secret of it. This object, this entirely
[10:17] it. This object, this entirely

[10:20] asymmetrical object, which in the past
[10:20] asymmetrical object, which in the past we've identified as a flame, flame of
[10:23] we've identified as a flame, flame of
[10:23] we've identified as a flame, flame of consciousness. Hebrew letters are said
[10:26] consciousness. Hebrew letters are said
[10:26] consciousness. Hebrew letters are said to come from flame. Arabic letters are
[10:28] to come from flame. Arabic letters are

[10:31] said to come from flame. Shadows of that
[10:31] said to come from flame. Shadows of that ob of this object are all of these
[10:33] ob of this object are all of these
[10:33] ob of this object are all of these Hebrew letters.
[10:35] Hebrew letters.
[10:35] Hebrew letters. Same one object generates all of these
[10:37] Same one object generates all of these
[10:37] Same one object generates all of these letters of the alphabet.
[10:39] letters of the alphabet.
[10:39] letters of the alphabet. And I'll show you that when we get a
[10:41] And I'll show you that when we get a
[10:41] And I'll show you that when we get a little farther along. I don't want to
[10:42] little farther along. I don't want to
[10:42] little farther along. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself because I
[10:44] get too far ahead of myself because I
[10:44] get too far ahead of myself because I want I do want to leave that towards the
[10:45] want I do want to leave that towards the
[10:45] want I do want to leave that towards the end. Okay,
[10:50] let's review
[10:54] let's review very quickly what we've done in the past
[10:57] very quickly what we've done in the past
[10:57] very quickly what we've done in the past and I I think I just said it. uh we
[10:59] and I I think I just said it. uh we
[10:59] and I I think I just said it. uh we found a pattern in the letters at the
[11:01] found a pattern in the letters at the
[11:01] found a pattern in the letters at the beginning of Genesis that when we
[11:04] beginning of Genesis that when we
[11:04] beginning of Genesis that when we expressed it in its most elegant form
[11:07] expressed it in its most elegant form
[11:07] expressed it in its most elegant form produced this shape words this
[11:10] produced this shape words this
[11:10] produced this shape words this say that that's the core of the to
[11:12] say that that's the core of the to
[11:12] say that that's the core of the to yeah you can see you can actually see
[11:14] yeah you can see you can actually see
[11:14] yeah you can see you can actually see that that in fact even though we're
[11:16] that that in fact even though we're
[11:16] that that in fact even though we're dealing here with a flat donut rather
[11:19] dealing here with a flat donut rather
[11:19] dealing here with a flat donut rather than a spherical donut what this form
[11:21] than a spherical donut what this form
[11:22] than a spherical donut what this form really is is nothing but
[11:25] really is is nothing but
[11:25] really is is nothing but the path of the seven color map of the
[11:28] the path of the seven color map of the
[11:28] the path of the seven color map of the vortex on the donut in its lowest order
[11:30] vortex on the donut in its lowest order
[11:30] vortex on the donut in its lowest order form. Now, this is not exactly the right
[11:32] form. Now, this is not exactly the right
[11:32] form. Now, this is not exactly the right shape for many reasons, but
[11:34] shape for many reasons, but
[11:34] shape for many reasons, but topologically it's the right shape.
[11:36] topologically it's the right shape.
[11:36] topologically it's the right shape. Geometrically, it's not. And that's the
[11:37] Geometrically, it's not. And that's the
[11:38] Geometrically, it's not. And that's the second thing we want to deal with is is
[11:39] second thing we want to deal with is is
[11:40] second thing we want to deal with is is determining the exact shape, which is
[11:41] determining the exact shape, which is
[11:41] determining the exact shape, which is what wasn't available a couple of years
[11:43] what wasn't available a couple of years
[11:43] what wasn't available a couple of years ago.
[11:45] ago.
[11:45] ago. So, let's let's talk about that.
[11:50] If you make a donut, an ideal donut,
[11:53] If you make a donut, an ideal donut, mathematicians donut, this is the type
[11:54] mathematicians donut, this is the type
[11:54] mathematicians donut, this is the type you typically make. It falls through
[11:56] you typically make. It falls through
[11:56] you typically make. It falls through itself.
[11:58] itself.
[11:58] itself. It's got two circular cross-sections. If
[12:00] It's got two circular cross-sections. If
[12:00] It's got two circular cross-sections. If you slice it this way, it's a circle.
[12:02] you slice it this way, it's a circle.
[12:02] you slice it this way, it's a circle. And if you slice it this way, it'll make
[12:03] And if you slice it this way, it'll make
[12:03] And if you slice it this way, it'll make two circles side by side. This is fine
[12:07] two circles side by side. This is fine
[12:07] two circles side by side. This is fine for mathematicians, but it doesn't tell
[12:09] for mathematicians, but it doesn't tell
[12:09] for mathematicians, but it doesn't tell us how to make the shape. For instance,
[12:12] us how to make the shape. For instance,
[12:12] us how to make the shape. For instance, if I simply took a spherical shape, a
[12:17] if I simply took a spherical shape, a
[12:17] if I simply took a spherical shape, a dimpled sphere, which is going to be
[12:18] dimpled sphere, which is going to be
[12:18] dimpled sphere, which is going to be closer to what we want here. I'll tell
[12:20] closer to what we want here. I'll tell
[12:20] closer to what we want here. I'll tell you why in a minute. I would have a form
[12:23] you why in a minute. I would have a form
[12:23] you why in a minute. I would have a form where the outside of the of the vortex
[12:25] where the outside of the of the vortex
[12:25] where the outside of the of the vortex came along horizont horizontally.
[12:27] came along horizont horizontally.
[12:27] came along horizont horizontally. Whereas on this form, as you can see, if
[12:29] Whereas on this form, as you can see, if
[12:29] Whereas on this form, as you can see, if I compare it, it comes through
[12:31] I compare it, it comes through
[12:31] I compare it, it comes through vertically. Why? Okay,
[12:34] vertically. Why? Okay,
[12:34] vertically. Why? Okay, let's let's do that first.
[12:39] let's let's do that first.
[12:39] let's let's do that first. What we're looking at, and fact, I think
[12:41] What we're looking at, and fact, I think
[12:41] What we're looking at, and fact, I think I want I want to um
[12:44] I want I want to um
[12:44] I want I want to um I want to read you a quote, I think.
[12:49] Yeah, let's do that first.
[12:53] Yeah, let's do that first. Let's do that first.
[12:55] Let's do that first.
[12:55] Let's do that first. Um, except I don't have it in this book.
[12:56] Um, except I don't have it in this book.
[12:56] Um, except I don't have it in this book. I had Okay, this is a quote I've read
[12:58] I had Okay, this is a quote I've read
[12:58] I had Okay, this is a quote I've read before and this is the key to the whole
[13:00] before and this is the key to the whole
[13:00] before and this is the key to the whole to the whole process.
[13:03] to the whole process.
[13:03] to the whole process. This is a discussion in the introduction
[13:05] This is a discussion in the introduction
[13:05] This is a discussion in the introduction to the Zohar which is a cobalistic text
[13:09] to the Zohar which is a cobalistic text
[13:10] to the Zohar which is a cobalistic text and I'll just read it to you and then
[13:12] and I'll just read it to you and then
[13:12] and I'll just read it to you and then we'll talk about the key point. It's
[13:14] we'll talk about the key point. It's
[13:14] we'll talk about the key point. It's called the lily. And it says, "The
[13:16] called the lily. And it says, "The
[13:16] called the lily. And it says, "The students of Rabbi Shimon were assembled
[13:18] students of Rabbi Shimon were assembled
[13:18] students of Rabbi Shimon were assembled together and sitting in silence, waiting
[13:20] together and sitting in silence, waiting
[13:20] together and sitting in silence, waiting for the master to begin his discourse.
[13:21] for the master to begin his discourse.
[13:21] for the master to begin his discourse. At length, Rabbi Shiman spoke and he
[13:23] At length, Rabbi Shiman spoke and he
[13:23] At length, Rabbi Shiman spoke and he said, "As a lily among the thorns," and
[13:26] said, "As a lily among the thorns," and
[13:26] said, "As a lily among the thorns," and I've talked about that before. The liies
[13:28] I've talked about that before. The liies
[13:28] I've talked about that before. The liies are all of these vortex shapes, all of
[13:30] are all of these vortex shapes, all of
[13:30] are all of these vortex shapes, all of the smooth shapes. In fact, you can see
[13:33] the smooth shapes. In fact, you can see
[13:34] the smooth shapes. In fact, you can see if you look down into this, it looks
[13:35] if you look down into this, it looks
[13:35] if you look down into this, it looks sort of like a lily, like a cow lily.
[13:39] sort of like a lily, like a cow lily.
[13:39] sort of like a lily, like a cow lily. And the thorns are all a polyhedra. All
[13:43] And the thorns are all a polyhedra. All
[13:44] And the thorns are all a polyhedra. All Well, there's a thorn. It looks a little
[13:45] Well, there's a thorn. It looks a little
[13:45] Well, there's a thorn. It looks a little like a thorn. And when you put the two
[13:47] like a thorn. And when you put the two
[13:47] like a thorn. And when you put the two two of them together, you're going to
[13:48] two of them together, you're going to
[13:48] two of them together, you're going to make the system. So, continuing this
[13:51] make the system. So, continuing this
[13:51] make the system. So, continuing this word lily, what does it mean and
[13:52] word lily, what does it mean and
[13:52] word lily, what does it mean and symbolize? He says it symbolizes the
[13:54] symbolize? He says it symbolizes the
[13:54] symbolize? He says it symbolizes the congregation of Israel. And the lily has
[13:56] congregation of Israel. And the lily has
[13:56] congregation of Israel. And the lily has 13 leaves surrounding it on all sides.
[13:57] 13 leaves surrounding it on all sides.
[13:57] 13 leaves surrounding it on all sides. And we've talked that about that before.
[14:00] And we've talked that about that before.
[14:00] And we've talked that about that before. If you make a sphere out of spheres,
[14:03] If you make a sphere out of spheres,
[14:03] If you make a sphere out of spheres, there are 12 spheres around a central
[14:05] there are 12 spheres around a central
[14:05] there are 12 spheres around a central sphere. You could take the outer set of
[14:08] sphere. You could take the outer set of
[14:08] sphere. You could take the outer set of spheres to be the meat of a fruit and
[14:10] spheres to be the meat of a fruit and
[14:10] spheres to be the meat of a fruit and the central sphere to be the seed. And
[14:12] the central sphere to be the seed. And
[14:12] the central sphere to be the seed. And we'll see why that happens in a second.
[14:14] we'll see why that happens in a second.
[14:14] we'll see why that happens in a second. For this reason, the lily symbolizes the
[14:16] For this reason, the lily symbolizes the
[14:16] For this reason, the lily symbolizes the cup of blessing. And he goes on and
[14:18] cup of blessing. And he goes on and
[14:18] cup of blessing. And he goes on and says, uh, well, let me just read it. As
[14:21] says, uh, well, let me just read it. As
[14:21] says, uh, well, let me just read it. As there are five words between the second
[14:23] there are five words between the second
[14:23] there are five words between the second and third Elo mentioned in the book of
[14:24] and third Elo mentioned in the book of
[14:24] and third Elo mentioned in the book of Genesis, one of these words is ore,
[14:26] Genesis, one of these words is ore,
[14:26] Genesis, one of these words is ore, meaning light. This light was treated.
[14:28] meaning light. This light was treated.
[14:28] meaning light. This light was treated. Well, now we've got light. This light
[14:30] Well, now we've got light. This light
[14:30] Well, now we've got light. This light was treated and became enclosed as an
[14:33] was treated and became enclosed as an
[14:33] was treated and became enclosed as an embryo
[14:35] embryo
[14:35] embryo in the covenant. And entering into the
[14:37] in the covenant. And entering into the
[14:37] in the covenant. And entering into the lily as a principle of life made it
[14:39] lily as a principle of life made it
[14:39] lily as a principle of life made it fruitful. And this is what is called in
[14:41] fruitful. And this is what is called in
[14:41] fruitful. And this is what is called in Genesis fruit tree yielding fruit whose
[14:44] Genesis fruit tree yielding fruit whose
[14:44] Genesis fruit tree yielding fruit whose seed is in itself. And as this life
[14:47] seed is in itself. And as this life
[14:47] seed is in itself. And as this life principle entering into the covenant
[14:49] principle entering into the covenant
[14:49] principle entering into the covenant caused itself to become manifest in 42
[14:51] caused itself to become manifest in 42
[14:52] caused itself to become manifest in 42 kinds of second matter. So it has
[14:53] kinds of second matter. So it has
[14:53] kinds of second matter. So it has produced the 42let name of God which
[14:58] produced the 42let name of God which
[14:58] produced the 42let name of God which operated in the creation of the world.
[15:00] operated in the creation of the world.
[15:00] operated in the creation of the world. If you were to make another layer of
[15:02] If you were to make another layer of
[15:02] If you were to make another layer of spheres, there would be 42 spheres. And
[15:04] spheres, there would be 42 spheres. And
[15:04] spheres, there would be 42 spheres. And so we're identifying this figure. But
[15:06] so we're identifying this figure. But
[15:06] so we're identifying this figure. But the key phrase here is fruit tree
[15:09] the key phrase here is fruit tree
[15:09] the key phrase here is fruit tree yielding fruit whose seed is in itself.
[15:13] yielding fruit whose seed is in itself.
[15:13] yielding fruit whose seed is in itself. If we take that literally, we can unfurl
[15:16] If we take that literally, we can unfurl
[15:16] If we take that literally, we can unfurl the whole alphabet and all of its
[15:18] the whole alphabet and all of its
[15:18] the whole alphabet and all of its meaning. And that's one of the things
[15:20] meaning. And that's one of the things
[15:20] meaning. And that's one of the things that has happened recently.
[15:23] that has happened recently.
[15:23] that has happened recently. If you look at a fruit, here's an
[15:26] If you look at a fruit, here's an
[15:26] If you look at a fruit, here's an idealized fruit. It's a dimpled sphere.
[15:31] idealized fruit. It's a dimpled sphere.
[15:31] idealized fruit. It's a dimpled sphere. One could abstract it. There's a star of
[15:33] One could abstract it. There's a star of
[15:33] One could abstract it. There's a star of seeds in the middle. If you slice
[15:35] seeds in the middle. If you slice
[15:35] seeds in the middle. If you slice through an apple horizontally, you'll
[15:36] through an apple horizontally, you'll
[15:36] through an apple horizontally, you'll see a star of seeds in the middle and
[15:38] see a star of seeds in the middle and
[15:38] see a star of seeds in the middle and two sort of elliptical cross-sections.
[15:41] two sort of elliptical cross-sections.
[15:41] two sort of elliptical cross-sections. And one could put a
[15:43] And one could put a
[15:43] And one could put a seven color map, a vortex on that donut,
[15:46] seven color map, a vortex on that donut,
[15:46] seven color map, a vortex on that donut, on that dipple sphere. And then we would
[15:49] on that dipple sphere. And then we would
[15:49] on that dipple sphere. And then we would have here's here's again our our fruit.
[15:52] have here's here's again our our fruit.
[15:52] have here's here's again our our fruit. But this is a fruit tree bearing fruit
[15:56] But this is a fruit tree bearing fruit
[15:56] But this is a fruit tree bearing fruit whose seed is in itself. So obviously in
[15:58] whose seed is in itself. So obviously in
[15:58] whose seed is in itself. So obviously in the center there's got to be a fruit.
[16:00] the center there's got to be a fruit.
[16:00] the center there's got to be a fruit. And between the seed and the fruit,
[16:02] And between the seed and the fruit,
[16:02] And between the seed and the fruit, there has to be the life cycle of the
[16:05] there has to be the life cycle of the
[16:05] there has to be the life cycle of the fruit tree. And that's the key to the
[16:07] fruit tree. And that's the key to the
[16:07] fruit tree. And that's the key to the understanding of what's being said here.
[16:09] understanding of what's being said here.
[16:09] understanding of what's being said here. From a seed to a tree to a fruit with
[16:14] From a seed to a tree to a fruit with
[16:14] From a seed to a tree to a fruit with new seed inside is one complete cycle of
[16:17] new seed inside is one complete cycle of
[16:18] new seed inside is one complete cycle of life.
[16:19] life.
[16:20] life. It's a recursive cycle and it's a self-
[16:22] It's a recursive cycle and it's a self-
[16:22] It's a recursive cycle and it's a self- embedment. After all,
[16:26] embedment. After all,
[16:26] embedment. After all, the sphere in the middle representing
[16:28] the sphere in the middle representing
[16:28] the sphere in the middle representing the seed pack could itself be made up of
[16:31] the seed pack could itself be made up of
[16:31] the seed pack could itself be made up of 12 spheres and have a sphere in the
[16:33] 12 spheres and have a sphere in the
[16:33] 12 spheres and have a sphere in the middle of it. And one could go
[16:35] middle of it. And one could go
[16:35] middle of it. And one could go generation on generation from the seed
[16:37] generation on generation from the seed
[16:37] generation on generation from the seed through the tree to the fruit with a
[16:39] through the tree to the fruit with a
[16:39] through the tree to the fruit with a seed, plant that seed, grow a new tree,
[16:42] seed, plant that seed, grow a new tree,
[16:42] seed, plant that seed, grow a new tree, and one could have acorn and oak tree,
[16:43] and one could have acorn and oak tree,
[16:44] and one could have acorn and oak tree, acorn and oak tree endlessly, infinitely
[16:46] acorn and oak tree endlessly, infinitely
[16:46] acorn and oak tree endlessly, infinitely long. And since we can't examine an
[16:48] long. And since we can't examine an
[16:48] long. And since we can't examine an infinite series because we don't last
[16:50] infinite series because we don't last
[16:50] infinite series because we don't last long enough to do it, we have to look at
[16:52] long enough to do it, we have to look at
[16:52] long enough to do it, we have to look at just one module of the series, one one
[16:55] just one module of the series, one one
[16:55] just one module of the series, one one section. And that's the section from the
[16:57] section. And that's the section from the
[16:57] section. And that's the section from the seed through the tree to the fruit with
[16:59] seed through the tree to the fruit with
[16:59] seed through the tree to the fruit with the new seed inside. And that's a
[17:01] the new seed inside. And that's a
[17:01] the new seed inside. And that's a relationship between inside and outside
[17:03] relationship between inside and outside
[17:03] relationship between inside and outside because we're going from inside where
[17:04] because we're going from inside where
[17:04] because we're going from inside where the seeds are to outside where the fruit
[17:06] the seeds are to outside where the fruit
[17:06] the seeds are to outside where the fruit is. If you look down on it, you see this
[17:09] is. If you look down on it, you see this
[17:09] is. If you look down on it, you see this little heart with a star in the middle
[17:11] little heart with a star in the middle
[17:11] little heart with a star in the middle of it. You can compare this fruit by the
[17:14] of it. You can compare this fruit by the
[17:14] of it. You can compare this fruit by the way which basically stretches itself
[17:16] way which basically stretches itself
[17:16] way which basically stretches itself generation after generation between the

[17:26] fruit looks just like a heart stretches
[17:26] fruit looks just like a heart stretches between physical reality and spiritual
[17:28] between physical reality and spiritual
[17:28] between physical reality and spiritual reality that we reach we span our
[17:31] reality that we reach we span our
[17:31] reality that we reach we span our lifetimes. that same process. When we're
[17:33] lifetimes. that same process. When we're
[17:33] lifetimes. that same process. When we're born, we're all physical and we don't
[17:36] born, we're all physical and we don't
[17:36] born, we're all physical and we don't have much developed consciousness. And
[17:38] have much developed consciousness. And
[17:38] have much developed consciousness. And when we age, our physicality starts to
[17:40] when we age, our physicality starts to
[17:40] when we age, our physicality starts to deteriorate, but hopefully we're
[17:42] deteriorate, but hopefully we're
[17:42] deteriorate, but hopefully we're building an emery of consciousness
[17:43] building an emery of consciousness
[17:44] building an emery of consciousness inside.
[17:45] inside.
[17:45] inside. And so when we're when we're when we're
[17:47] And so when we're when we're when we're
[17:47] And so when we're when we're when we're finished with our life cycle, we're all
[17:48] finished with our life cycle, we're all
[17:48] finished with our life cycle, we're all spirit and we're very little matter. And
[17:50] spirit and we're very little matter. And
[17:50] spirit and we're very little matter. And then theoretically, the process
[17:52] then theoretically, the process
[17:52] then theoretically, the process restarts. And so this is the metaphor
[17:55] restarts. And so this is the metaphor
[17:55] restarts. And so this is the metaphor between a fruit tree and our own
[17:56] between a fruit tree and our own
[17:56] between a fruit tree and our own spiritual growth that we are the tree
[17:59] spiritual growth that we are the tree
[17:59] spiritual growth that we are the tree now growing between our birth and our
[18:00] now growing between our birth and our
[18:00] now growing between our birth and our death. We we we are spanning between
[18:03] death. We we we are spanning between
[18:03] death. We we we are spanning between inside and outside on our chain of
[18:05] inside and outside on our chain of
[18:05] inside and outside on our chain of being.
[18:08] Okay. Now, just to just to tidy up, and
[18:11] Okay. Now, just to just to tidy up, and this is in some of the material that's
[18:13] this is in some of the material that's
[18:13] this is in some of the material that's available. Um
[18:15] available. Um
[18:15] available. Um Grace at the door, I think, has some of
[18:17] Grace at the door, I think, has some of
[18:17] Grace at the door, I think, has some of the papers that that show some of these
[18:18] the papers that that show some of these
[18:18] the papers that that show some of these things.
[18:20] things.
[18:20] things. What's going to determine the shape of
[18:22] What's going to determine the shape of
[18:22] What's going to determine the shape of this curve?
[18:24] this curve?
[18:24] this curve? Well, if we just had a point in there,
[18:26] Well, if we just had a point in there,
[18:26] Well, if we just had a point in there, if this seed model was a dead thing,
[18:28] if this seed model was a dead thing,
[18:28] if this seed model was a dead thing, just an idealized point, a mathematical
[18:30] just an idealized point, a mathematical
[18:30] just an idealized point, a mathematical point, a cartisian point, we'd have very
[18:32] point, a cartisian point, we'd have very
[18:32] point, a cartisian point, we'd have very little. But a seed isn't an idealized
[18:35] little. But a seed isn't an idealized
[18:35] little. But a seed isn't an idealized point. The seed has life force in it
[18:37] point. The seed has life force in it
[18:37] point. The seed has life force in it somehow. And we need, if we're going to
[18:39] somehow. And we need, if we're going to
[18:39] somehow. And we need, if we're going to make a geometric model, we need to have
[18:41] make a geometric model, we need to have
[18:41] make a geometric model, we need to have some sort of a model for that life
[18:42] some sort of a model for that life
[18:42] some sort of a model for that life force. Well, in this model, it appears
[18:45] force. Well, in this model, it appears
[18:45] force. Well, in this model, it appears that that the analog, the metaphor for
[18:48] that that the analog, the metaphor for
[18:48] that that the analog, the metaphor for the life force is angular momentum.
[18:51] the life force is angular momentum.
[18:51] the life force is angular momentum. that it's because there is an intrinsic
[18:53] that it's because there is an intrinsic
[18:53] that it's because there is an intrinsic spin in the seed
[18:55] spin in the seed
[18:55] spin in the seed that the seed unfurs. And so one can
[18:58] that the seed unfurs. And so one can
[18:58] that the seed unfurs. And so one can look at
[19:00] look at
[19:00] look at this shape and one can say that's the
[19:02] this shape and one can say that's the
[19:02] this shape and one can say that's the seed and this is the stem erupting from
[19:05] seed and this is the stem erupting from
[19:05] seed and this is the stem erupting from the seed and this is the unfurling of
[19:07] the seed and this is the unfurling of
[19:07] the seed and this is the unfurling of leaves and branches and this is the
[19:09] leaves and branches and this is the
[19:09] leaves and branches and this is the fullness of the fruit comes to fruition.
[19:12] fullness of the fruit comes to fruition.
[19:12] fullness of the fruit comes to fruition. And so this is the whole life cycle from
[19:14] And so this is the whole life cycle from
[19:14] And so this is the whole life cycle from inside to outside from the seed to the
[19:17] inside to outside from the seed to the
[19:17] inside to outside from the seed to the fruit.
[19:19] fruit.
[19:19] fruit. Now, if we're going to be modeling the
[19:22] Now, if we're going to be modeling the
[19:22] Now, if we're going to be modeling the life force by angular momentum, then we
[19:26] life force by angular momentum, then we
[19:26] life force by angular momentum, then we have to conserve angular momentum and
[19:29] have to conserve angular momentum and
[19:29] have to conserve angular momentum and that's what determines the shape of the
[19:30] that's what determines the shape of the
[19:30] that's what determines the shape of the curve. You don't have to have a lot of
[19:32] curve. You don't have to have a lot of
[19:32] curve. You don't have to have a lot of physics to know what's going to happen.
[19:35] physics to know what's going to happen.
[19:35] physics to know what's going to happen. If you have a dancer and the dancer is
[19:37] If you have a dancer and the dancer is
[19:37] If you have a dancer and the dancer is spinning, has angular momentum in them.
[19:40] spinning, has angular momentum in them.
[19:40] spinning, has angular momentum in them. They're spinning. They spin very quickly
[19:42] They're spinning. They spin very quickly
[19:42] They're spinning. They spin very quickly when their arms are in close and they
[19:44] when their arms are in close and they
[19:44] when their arms are in close and they slow down when they put their arms out.
[19:47] slow down when they put their arms out.
[19:47] slow down when they put their arms out. Now the cobalistic descriptions say that
[19:49] Now the cobalistic descriptions say that
[19:49] Now the cobalistic descriptions say that the arms of the universe go to infinity.
[19:51] the arms of the universe go to infinity.
[19:51] the arms of the universe go to infinity. If you could put your arms at infinity
[19:53] If you could put your arms at infinity
[19:53] If you could put your arms at infinity then you would come to a stop. That's
[19:56] then you would come to a stop. That's
[19:56] then you would come to a stop. That's what's determining the shape of the
[19:57] what's determining the shape of the
[19:57] what's determining the shape of the curve. You see here the sprout all the
[20:00] curve. You see here the sprout all the
[20:00] curve. You see here the sprout all the energy of the life force of the fruit of
[20:03] energy of the life force of the fruit of
[20:03] energy of the life force of the fruit of the seed I'm sorry is erupting along the
[20:05] the seed I'm sorry is erupting along the
[20:05] the seed I'm sorry is erupting along the new stem the new sprout and there's not
[20:07] new stem the new sprout and there's not
[20:07] new stem the new sprout and there's not much width. Then at the top of the
[20:09] much width. Then at the top of the
[20:09] much width. Then at the top of the sprout you get this little pair of
[20:11] sprout you get this little pair of
[20:11] sprout you get this little pair of leaves and then you start to unfurl the
[20:13] leaves and then you start to unfurl the
[20:13] leaves and then you start to unfurl the rest of the plant and it reaches its its
[20:15] rest of the plant and it reaches its its
[20:15] rest of the plant and it reaches its its maximum unfurlment in any particular
[20:17] maximum unfurlment in any particular
[20:17] maximum unfurlment in any particular year life cycle and then it build then
[20:20] year life cycle and then it build then
[20:20] year life cycle and then it build then it starts to bud and flower and make
[20:21] it starts to bud and flower and make
[20:21] it starts to bud and flower and make fruit and eventually the flowers fall to
[20:24] fruit and eventually the flowers fall to
[20:24] fruit and eventually the flowers fall to the ground and the seed is thrown to the
[20:25] the ground and the seed is thrown to the
[20:25] the ground and the seed is thrown to the wind and falls to the ground and a new
[20:27] wind and falls to the ground and a new
[20:27] wind and falls to the ground and a new cycle starts. So, what we're saying here
[20:30] cycle starts. So, what we're saying here
[20:30] cycle starts. So, what we're saying here is that all of this momentum has to be
[20:33] is that all of this momentum has to be
[20:33] is that all of this momentum has to be spent by the time you get to the fruit
[20:35] spent by the time you get to the fruit
[20:35] spent by the time you get to the fruit because it's going to collapse that down
[20:36] because it's going to collapse that down
[20:36] because it's going to collapse that down again to that center point. So, when you
[20:39] again to that center point. So, when you
[20:39] again to that center point. So, when you get to the outside, you're going to
[20:41] get to the outside, you're going to
[20:41] get to the outside, you're going to break you're going to grow a new a new
[20:42] break you're going to grow a new a new
[20:42] break you're going to grow a new a new seed in the middle and transfer that
[20:44] seed in the middle and transfer that
[20:44] seed in the middle and transfer that momentum. Now, we know that a real fruit
[20:47] momentum. Now, we know that a real fruit
[20:48] momentum. Now, we know that a real fruit doesn't look like a donut. A real fruit
[20:51] doesn't look like a donut. A real fruit
[20:51] doesn't look like a donut. A real fruit is more closely approximated. This is
[20:54] is more closely approximated. This is
[20:54] is more closely approximated. This is the work of an artist named um I think
[20:56] the work of an artist named um I think
[20:56] the work of an artist named um I think it's Charles Adams in New York made this
[20:58] it's Charles Adams in New York made this
[20:58] it's Charles Adams in New York made this a number of years ago. He called it
[20:59] a number of years ago. He called it
[20:59] a number of years ago. He called it Genesis by the way. A real fruit if I
[21:02] Genesis by the way. A real fruit if I
[21:02] Genesis by the way. A real fruit if I can figure out where it opens. There it
[21:03] can figure out where it opens. There it
[21:03] can figure out where it opens. There it is. Has these elliptical cross-sections.
[21:07] is. Has these elliptical cross-sections.
[21:07] is. Has these elliptical cross-sections. It's a dimpled sphere. But nevertheless,
[21:12] the minimum way of representing the
[21:15] the minimum way of representing the self-reerential quality, the life
[21:17] self-reerential quality, the life
[21:17] self-reerential quality, the life cycling quality, the seed out to fruit
[21:22] cycling quality, the seed out to fruit
[21:22] cycling quality, the seed out to fruit and then back to seed.
[21:23] and then back to seed.
[21:24] and then back to seed. is the seven colored map that defines
[21:26] is the seven colored map that defines
[21:26] is the seven colored map that defines the surface of the donut. Just because
[21:28] the surface of the donut. Just because
[21:28] the surface of the donut. Just because it's a dimple sphere doesn't change the
[21:29] it's a dimple sphere doesn't change the
[21:30] it's a dimple sphere doesn't change the topology in it. It's still going to have
[21:31] topology in it. It's still going to have
[21:31] topology in it. It's still going to have these same seven sections.
[21:33] these same seven sections.
[21:33] these same seven sections. So we now have three criteria which I'm
[21:37] So we now have three criteria which I'm
[21:37] So we now have three criteria which I'm saying should be able to determine this
[21:39] saying should be able to determine this
[21:39] saying should be able to determine this shape uniquely. One, we have to be
[21:42] shape uniquely. One, we have to be
[21:42] shape uniquely. One, we have to be modeling a real fruit and not somebody's
[21:44] modeling a real fruit and not somebody's
[21:44] modeling a real fruit and not somebody's lunch,
[21:46] lunch,
[21:46] lunch, somebody's cooked food lunch. We have to
[21:48] somebody's cooked food lunch. We have to
[21:48] somebody's cooked food lunch. We have to have a real a real snack, a real a real
[21:50] have a real a real snack, a real a real
[21:50] have a real a real snack, a real a real apple, a dimpled sphere. We have to
[21:52] apple, a dimpled sphere. We have to
[21:52] apple, a dimpled sphere. We have to conserve angular momentum because we're
[21:54] conserve angular momentum because we're
[21:54] conserve angular momentum because we're representing the light force
[21:56] representing the light force
[21:56] representing the light force and
[21:58] and
[21:58] and it has to have this seven color map
[22:01] it has to have this seven color map
[22:01] it has to have this seven color map which can be minimally expressed in
[22:04] which can be minimally expressed in
[22:04] which can be minimally expressed in three turns for one turn through or
[22:06] three turns for one turn through or
[22:06] three turns for one turn through or alternately three turns through for one

[22:09] alternately three turns through for one turn around. This is the only two ways
[22:11] turn around. This is the only two ways
[22:11] turn around. This is the only two ways that one can minimally make the seven
[22:13] that one can minimally make the seven
[22:13] that one can minimally make the seven color map. But again, we're going with
[22:14] color map. But again, we're going with
[22:14] color map. But again, we're going with AAM's razor here. We're going to try to
[22:15] AAM's razor here. We're going to try to
[22:15] AAM's razor here. We're going to try to go for the most elegant minimum state.
[22:17] go for the most elegant minimum state.
[22:17] go for the most elegant minimum state. Obviously, you can make all kinds of
[22:19] Obviously, you can make all kinds of
[22:19] Obviously, you can make all kinds of vortexes on all kinds of donuts, but the
[22:22] vortexes on all kinds of donuts, but the
[22:22] vortexes on all kinds of donuts, but the two ways that one can do it minimally
[22:24] two ways that one can do it minimally
[22:24] two ways that one can do it minimally are just these three in one or one and
[22:26] are just these three in one or one and
[22:26] are just these three in one or one and three turns. Two and two turns come
[22:28] three turns. Two and two turns come
[22:28] three turns. Two and two turns come apart. You don't make a donut. And zero
[22:31] apart. You don't make a donut. And zero
[22:31] apart. You don't make a donut. And zero and four turns isn't any turns at all.
[22:33] and four turns isn't any turns at all.
[22:33] and four turns isn't any turns at all. So, the only ways that you the only ways
[22:35] So, the only ways that you the only ways
[22:35] So, the only ways that you the only ways you can make the seven color map for the
[22:36] you can make the seven color map for the
[22:36] you can make the seven color map for the type frame these two forms.
[22:38] type frame these two forms.
[22:38] type frame these two forms. Why do you divide the donut into seven
[22:39] Why do you divide the donut into seven
[22:39] Why do you divide the donut into seven regions?
[22:40] regions?
[22:40] regions? Because the topology that defines the
[22:42] Because the topology that defines the
[22:42] Because the topology that defines the surface of the donut says that there is
[22:44] surface of the donut says that there is
[22:44] surface of the donut says that there is a seven color map. In other words,
[22:45] a seven color map. In other words,
[22:45] a seven color map. In other words, creating a seven color map is the
[22:47] creating a seven color map is the
[22:47] creating a seven color map is the equivalent to creating a donut. For
[22:49] equivalent to creating a donut. For
[22:49] equivalent to creating a donut. For instance, this
[22:52] instance, this
[22:52] instance, this only a mathematician could get nutrition
[22:54] only a mathematician could get nutrition
[22:54] only a mathematician could get nutrition out of this doughut. This is very flat
[22:56] out of this doughut. This is very flat
[22:56] out of this doughut. This is very flat and very square. But it has all the
[22:58] and very square. But it has all the
[22:58] and very square. But it has all the qualities of a donut. It connects its
[23:00] qualities of a donut. It connects its
[23:00] qualities of a donut. It connects its left to its right, its top to its
[23:02] left to its right, its top to its
[23:02] left to its right, its top to its bottom. After all, if you were going to
[23:03] bottom. After all, if you were going to
[23:03] bottom. After all, if you were going to make a donut, you would connect top to
[23:05] make a donut, you would connect top to
[23:05] make a donut, you would connect top to bottom and left and right. And this tube
[23:07] bottom and left and right. And this tube
[23:07] bottom and left and right. And this tube would come around and form a donut. and
[23:09] would come around and form a donut. and
[23:09] would come around and form a donut. and the topologists have proven that the
[23:12] the topologists have proven that the
[23:12] the topologists have proven that the minimum way to represent that surface is
[23:14] minimum way to represent that surface is
[23:14] minimum way to represent that surface is with this seven color map. So that's
[23:16] with this seven color map. So that's
[23:16] with this seven color map. So that's something that that you have to take as
[23:18] something that that you have to take as
[23:18] something that that you have to take as for purposes of this discussion as a
[23:20] for purposes of this discussion as a
[23:20] for purposes of this discussion as a given. It's topological truth. Also as
[23:23] given. It's topological truth. Also as
[23:23] given. It's topological truth. Also as Arthur points out the relationship
[23:25] Arthur points out the relationship
[23:25] Arthur points out the relationship between reflexive process and the
[23:26] between reflexive process and the
[23:26] between reflexive process and the surface of the donut. I suggest you read
[23:28] surface of the donut. I suggest you read
[23:28] surface of the donut. I suggest you read the reflexive universe for detailed
[23:30] the reflexive universe for detailed
[23:30] the reflexive universe for detailed discussion of that probably better than
[23:31] discussion of that probably better than
[23:31] discussion of that probably better than I could do.
[23:33] I could do.
[23:33] I could do. Now,
[23:36] Now,
[23:36] Now, this is
[23:38] this is
[23:38] this is one new piece of information because
[23:40] one new piece of information because
[23:40] one new piece of information because last year, the year before, we didn't
[23:42] last year, the year before, we didn't
[23:42] last year, the year before, we didn't know why this shape worked and this
[23:46] know why this shape worked and this
[23:46] know why this shape worked and this shape didn't work.
[23:50] shape didn't work.
[23:50] shape didn't work. And that leads us to a key idea.
[23:53] And that leads us to a key idea.
[23:53] And that leads us to a key idea. We are going to be taking topological
[23:55] We are going to be taking topological
[23:55] We are going to be taking topological forms that are minimal, but we're going
[23:58] forms that are minimal, but we're going
[23:58] forms that are minimal, but we're going to embody them geometrically in ways
[24:00] to embody them geometrically in ways
[24:00] to embody them geometrically in ways that represent living things. In other
[24:02] that represent living things. In other
[24:02] that represent living things. In other words, we're putting an additional
[24:03] words, we're putting an additional
[24:03] words, we're putting an additional constraint. If we didn't have a
[24:04] constraint. If we didn't have a
[24:04] constraint. If we didn't have a geometric constraint, we could use this
[24:06] geometric constraint, we could use this
[24:06] geometric constraint, we could use this form of donut. But because we're
[24:08] form of donut. But because we're
[24:08] form of donut. But because we're modeling a fruit tree,
[24:09] modeling a fruit tree,
[24:09] modeling a fruit tree, excuse me, Stan, will that show the all
[24:12] excuse me, Stan, will that show the all
[24:12] excuse me, Stan, will that show the all the seven touching one another?
[24:14] the seven touching one another?
[24:14] the seven touching one another? Yes. Yes.
[24:14] Yes. Yes.
[24:14] Yes. Yes. Oh, that does. In fact,
[24:17] Oh, that does. In fact,
[24:17] Oh, that does. In fact, in fact, I'll show you how good a
[24:18] in fact, I'll show you how good a
[24:18] in fact, I'll show you how good a metaphor for a living thing this is. If
[24:20] metaphor for a living thing this is. If
[24:20] metaphor for a living thing this is. If I had a stem here and I pushed this down
[24:22] I had a stem here and I pushed this down
[24:22] I had a stem here and I pushed this down on the stem, watch the leaves unfurl
[24:25] on the stem, watch the leaves unfurl
[24:25] on the stem, watch the leaves unfurl along the stem. If this was drawn flat,
[24:28] along the stem. If this was drawn flat,
[24:28] along the stem. If this was drawn flat, those would be rectalinear regions. But
[24:31] those would be rectalinear regions. But
[24:31] those would be rectalinear regions. But you see the leaf shaped sections coming
[24:32] you see the leaf shaped sections coming
[24:32] you see the leaf shaped sections coming out.
[24:34] out.
[24:34] out. It's as if I were pulling it down the
[24:36] It's as if I were pulling it down the
[24:36] It's as if I were pulling it down the stem and it's literally unfurling these
[24:37] stem and it's literally unfurling these
[24:37] stem and it's literally unfurling these leaves each colored region and and it
[24:39] leaves each colored region and and it

[24:50] exceedingly accurate model of embryionic
[24:50] exceedingly accurate model of embryionic growth. It really does I'm going to show

[24:56] you some more parts of it as we go on.
[24:56] you some more parts of it as we go on. Um,
[24:58] Um,
[24:58] Um, so that's this section and this is
[25:01] so that's this section and this is
[25:01] so that's this section and this is covered on the videotape called Code of
[25:03] covered on the videotape called Code of
[25:03] covered on the videotape called Code of Many Colors which we did as a
[25:05] Many Colors which we did as a
[25:05] Many Colors which we did as a supplement. There was another section
[25:08] supplement. There was another section
[25:08] supplement. There was another section that I wanted to cover that was should
[25:10] that I wanted to cover that was should
[25:10] that I wanted to cover that was should clear up some confusion and maybe people
[25:12] clear up some confusion and maybe people
[25:12] clear up some confusion and maybe people have been wondering about it. You may
[25:13] have been wondering about it. You may
[25:13] have been wondering about it. You may remember a number of years ago I brought
[25:16] remember a number of years ago I brought
[25:16] remember a number of years ago I brought out this little Rubik cube which has a
[25:18] out this little Rubik cube which has a
[25:18] out this little Rubik cube which has a Hebrew letter on each little cubby and I
[25:21] Hebrew letter on each little cubby and I
[25:21] Hebrew letter on each little cubby and I realized that it was the symmetry of
[25:23] realized that it was the symmetry of
[25:23] realized that it was the symmetry of this cube which has all 27 letters on it
[25:25] this cube which has all 27 letters on it
[25:25] this cube which has all 27 letters on it because it's 3x3x3. So there's 27
[25:28] because it's 3x3x3. So there's 27
[25:28] because it's 3x3x3. So there's 27 cubies, 27 letters. They were in
[25:30] cubies, 27 letters. They were in
[25:30] cubies, 27 letters. They were in alphabetical order layer by layer on a
[25:32] alphabetical order layer by layer on a
[25:32] alphabetical order layer by layer on a cartisian coordinate system. You can
[25:34] cartisian coordinate system. You can
[25:34] cartisian coordinate system. You can review that. But I never knew and what I
[25:37] review that. But I never knew and what I
[25:37] review that. But I never knew and what I what I found is a very strange thing. I
[25:38] what I found is a very strange thing. I
[25:38] what I found is a very strange thing. I didn't didn't bring the same model, but
[25:40] didn't didn't bring the same model, but
[25:40] didn't didn't bring the same model, but if you look at the at the first verse of
[25:42] if you look at the at the first verse of
[25:42] if you look at the at the first verse of Genesis, you notice something very
[25:44] Genesis, you notice something very
[25:44] Genesis, you notice something very strange. You notice that there are
[25:46] strange. You notice that there are
[25:46] strange. You notice that there are letters that occur an even number of
[25:47] letters that occur an even number of
[25:47] letters that occur an even number of times in the first verse and they're on
[25:49] times in the first verse and they're on
[25:49] times in the first verse and they're on the axis of symmetry. And you know, let
[25:51] the axis of symmetry. And you know, let
[25:51] the axis of symmetry. And you know, let notice that letters occur,
[25:53] notice that letters occur,
[25:54] notice that letters occur, some letters occur, say this one occurs
[25:57] some letters occur, say this one occurs
[25:57] some letters occur, say this one occurs 1, two, three times, and other letters
[25:58] 1, two, three times, and other letters
[25:58] 1, two, three times, and other letters occur one time. And I'm matching these
[26:01] occur one time. And I'm matching these
[26:01] occur one time. And I'm matching these letters up. What gave me the right to do
[26:02] letters up. What gave me the right to do
[26:02] letters up. What gave me the right to do that? They're not the same letters. What
[26:05] that? They're not the same letters. What
[26:05] that? They're not the same letters. What I found worked but didn't know why it
[26:07] I found worked but didn't know why it
[26:07] I found worked but didn't know why it worked was that the letters that are
[26:09] worked was that the letters that are
[26:09] worked was that the letters that are paired up in 3 to one proportion are on
[26:11] paired up in 3 to one proportion are on
[26:11] paired up in 3 to one proportion are on opposite sides of the cube. And so I
[26:13] opposite sides of the cube. And so I
[26:14] opposite sides of the cube. And so I have if I hold this properly here it is
[26:16] have if I hold this properly here it is
[26:16] have if I hold this properly here it is I have an M opposite an E. Again I'm
[26:18] I have an M opposite an E. Again I'm
[26:18] I have an M opposite an E. Again I'm using the English names. I have um a T
[26:22] using the English names. I have um a T
[26:22] using the English names. I have um a T opposite an F and those are the two that
[26:24] opposite an F and those are the two that
[26:24] opposite an F and those are the two that I'm showing over here. So it's the
[26:27] I'm showing over here. So it's the
[26:27] I'm showing over here. So it's the symmetry of the alphabet that enables us
[26:30] symmetry of the alphabet that enables us
[26:30] symmetry of the alphabet that enables us to correlate the text to find these
[26:33] to correlate the text to find these
[26:33] to correlate the text to find these patterns.
[26:35] patterns.

[26:52] embedded. That is very self-reerential. That's a very reflexive process. It's
[26:54] That's a very reflexive process. It's

[29:22] means tortoise. Not only that, but we're looking at a
[29:24] Not only that, but we're looking at a
[29:24] Not only that, but we're looking at a donut. And this is a donut. And that's a
[29:27] donut. And this is a donut. And that's a
[29:28] donut. And this is a donut. And that's a tortoise shell.
[29:30] tortoise shell.
[29:30] tortoise shell. You see, the hex map that makes the
[29:32] You see, the hex map that makes the
[29:32] You see, the hex map that makes the seven color map is the same as the
[29:33] seven color map is the same as the
[29:33] seven color map is the same as the pattern on the back of a tortoise.
[29:36] pattern on the back of a tortoise.
[29:36] pattern on the back of a tortoise. So maybe the ancients weren't so stupid.
[29:38] So maybe the ancients weren't so stupid.
[29:38] So maybe the ancients weren't so stupid. Maybe the guy that told the story didn't
[29:40] Maybe the guy that told the story didn't
[29:40] Maybe the guy that told the story didn't understand where it came from. But maybe
[29:42] understand where it came from. But maybe
[29:42] understand where it came from. But maybe if you went back far enough, there was
[29:44] if you went back far enough, there was
[29:44] if you went back far enough, there was an ancient worldview that knew something
[29:46] an ancient worldview that knew something
[29:46] an ancient worldview that knew something about the pattern of six around one, the
[29:48] about the pattern of six around one, the
[29:48] about the pattern of six around one, the pattern on a donut. In fact, that's
[29:51] pattern on a donut. In fact, that's
[29:51] pattern on a donut. In fact, that's likely to be the case.
[29:53] likely to be the case.
[29:53] likely to be the case. Okay, let's leave that. Um there's one
[29:56] Okay, let's leave that. Um there's one
[29:56] Okay, let's leave that. Um there's one more catching up section that I want to
[29:58] more catching up section that I want to
[29:58] more catching up section that I want to show you and this is um a little more
[30:01] show you and this is um a little more
[30:01] show you and this is um a little more complicated.
[30:03] complicated.
[30:03] complicated. So let's let's get them out of the way
[30:04] So let's let's get them out of the way
[30:04] So let's let's get them out of the way one at a time. This one basically shows
[30:07] one at a time. This one basically shows
[30:07] one at a time. This one basically shows us that the symmetry that we use to
[30:09] us that the symmetry that we use to
[30:09] us that the symmetry that we use to correlate the text to make these
[30:10] correlate the text to make these
[30:10] correlate the text to make these patterns is also traditionally
[30:12] patterns is also traditionally
[30:12] patterns is also traditionally meaningful without resorting to Rubic
[30:14] meaningful without resorting to Rubic
[30:14] meaningful without resorting to Rubic cubes and is based on the same donut
[30:16] cubes and is based on the same donut
[30:16] cubes and is based on the same donut except taking the donut in its other
[30:18] except taking the donut in its other
[30:18] except taking the donut in its other form. One form makes the letters and the
[30:21] form. One form makes the letters and the
[30:21] form. One form makes the letters and the other form arranges the letters. And
[30:22] other form arranges the letters. And
[30:22] other form arranges the letters. And we'll see in more detail how that works
[30:24] we'll see in more detail how that works
[30:24] we'll see in more detail how that works later. Now, one of the criticisms of
[30:27] later. Now, one of the criticisms of
[30:27] later. Now, one of the criticisms of what I've been doing over the years has
[30:29] what I've been doing over the years has
[30:29] what I've been doing over the years has been all the cobalistic texts say you
[30:31] been all the cobalistic texts say you
[30:31] been all the cobalistic texts say you should use the 22let Hebrew alphabet and
[30:33] should use the 22let Hebrew alphabet and
[30:33] should use the 22let Hebrew alphabet and I've been using a 27 letter Hebrew
[30:35] I've been using a 27 letter Hebrew
[30:35] I've been using a 27 letter Hebrew alphabet. Why in the world am I using
[30:37] alphabet. Why in the world am I using
[30:37] alphabet. Why in the world am I using why am I using these extra five letters?
[30:39] why am I using these extra five letters?
[30:39] why am I using these extra five letters? Well, in Hebrew, if you write a word and
[30:42] Well, in Hebrew, if you write a word and
[30:42] Well, in Hebrew, if you write a word and you use a letter, one of five letters in
[30:45] you use a letter, one of five letters in
[30:45] you use a letter, one of five letters in the middle of the word, you draw it in
[30:47] the middle of the word, you draw it in
[30:47] the middle of the word, you draw it in one way. And if you if it happens to be
[30:49] one way. And if you if it happens to be
[30:49] one way. And if you if it happens to be at the end of a word, it has a final
[30:51] at the end of a word, it has a final
[30:51] at the end of a word, it has a final form. You draw it differently. And there
[30:52] form. You draw it differently. And there
[30:52] form. You draw it differently. And there are five letters that have final forms.
[30:55] are five letters that have final forms.
[30:55] are five letters that have final forms. And it's taught that they contain the
[30:57] And it's taught that they contain the
[30:57] And it's taught that they contain the secret of redemption,
[30:59] secret of redemption,
[30:59] secret of redemption, that they somehow redeem something. It's
[31:00] that they somehow redeem something. It's
[31:00] that they somehow redeem something. It's not clear what, but let's assume they
[31:03] not clear what, but let's assume they
[31:03] not clear what, but let's assume they redeem the alphabet perhaps. The
[31:05] redeem the alphabet perhaps. The
[31:05] redeem the alphabet perhaps. The question is, where do these five letters
[31:06] question is, where do these five letters
[31:06] question is, where do these five letters come from? Why should we have these five
[31:08] come from? Why should we have these five
[31:08] come from? Why should we have these five final letters? What do they have to do
[31:09] final letters? What do they have to do
[31:09] final letters? What do they have to do with anything? And and and and how do
[31:11] with anything? And and and and how do
[31:11] with anything? And and and and how do they relate? How do the 22 and the 27
[31:13] they relate? How do the 22 and the 27
[31:13] they relate? How do the 22 and the 27 relate? Well, what we discovered is that
[31:16] relate? Well, what we discovered is that
[31:16] relate? Well, what we discovered is that if one looks at a 1/3 unit module of
[31:20] if one looks at a 1/3 unit module of
[31:20] if one looks at a 1/3 unit module of Buckminister Fuller's model of the
[31:22] Buckminister Fuller's model of the
[31:22] Buckminister Fuller's model of the tetrahelix DNA double helix, there are
[31:25] tetrahelix DNA double helix, there are
[31:25] tetrahelix DNA double helix, there are exactly 22 faces.
[31:28] exactly 22 faces.
[31:28] exactly 22 faces. Isn't that nice? Because that means we
[31:30] Isn't that nice? Because that means we
[31:30] Isn't that nice? Because that means we can fit the Hebrew letters on them. In
[31:32] can fit the Hebrew letters on them. In
[31:32] can fit the Hebrew letters on them. In fact, what I've done here is simply
[31:34] fact, what I've done here is simply
[31:34] fact, what I've done here is simply wrapped the alphabet around the form
[31:36] wrapped the alphabet around the form
[31:36] wrapped the alphabet around the form going in this order. Olive, bake,
[31:39] going in this order. Olive, bake,
[31:39] going in this order. Olive, bake, gimmel, doll, hey, etc. And wrapped it
[31:42] gimmel, doll, hey, etc. And wrapped it
[31:42] gimmel, doll, hey, etc. And wrapped it around this way. And then what I've done
[31:44] around this way. And then what I've done
[31:44] around this way. And then what I've done is peeled it off this way. So let's do
[31:46] is peeled it off this way. So let's do
[31:46] is peeled it off this way. So let's do that.
[31:48] that.
[31:48] that. Wow. It's an interesting thing to try.
[31:49] Wow. It's an interesting thing to try.
[31:50] Wow. It's an interesting thing to try. And it's a long story as to why we did
[31:51] And it's a long story as to why we did
[31:51] And it's a long story as to why we did that, but here it is. This is the here
[31:55] that, but here it is. This is the here
[31:55] that, but here it is. This is the here here's my my tetrahelix
[31:58] here's my my tetrahelix
[31:58] here's my my tetrahelix with the letters wrapped around it. I
[32:01] with the letters wrapped around it. I
[32:01] with the letters wrapped around it. I slit one of the edges and fold it flat,
[32:03] slit one of the edges and fold it flat,
[32:03] slit one of the edges and fold it flat, slice it up, and I make these three
[32:05] slice it up, and I make these three
[32:05] slice it up, and I make these three sections. And then I can read the
[32:06] sections. And then I can read the
[32:06] sections. And then I can read the alphabet off in a new order. um A F G L
[32:10] alphabet off in a new order. um A F G L
[32:10] alphabet off in a new order. um A F G L M Z QB C H J doesn't make any sense all
[32:16] M Z QB C H J doesn't make any sense all
[32:16] M Z QB C H J doesn't make any sense all garbled.
[32:18] garbled.
[32:18] garbled. But when we put these three on the three
[32:21] But when we put these three on the three
[32:21] But when we put these three on the three loops of the first distinction in not
[32:24] loops of the first distinction in not
[32:24] loops of the first distinction in not theory, the trifolium, the Tfoil knot,
[32:27] theory, the trifolium, the Tfoil knot,
[32:27] theory, the trifolium, the Tfoil knot, after all, the donut is the first
[32:29] after all, the donut is the first
[32:29] after all, the donut is the first distinction one can make in nothingness.
[32:32] distinction one can make in nothingness.
[32:32] distinction one can make in nothingness. You have a universe that's composed of
[32:34] You have a universe that's composed of
[32:34] You have a universe that's composed of transparent homogeneous isotropic cosmic
[32:36] transparent homogeneous isotropic cosmic
[32:36] transparent homogeneous isotropic cosmic jell-o and you try to make a form that
[32:39] jell-o and you try to make a form that
[32:39] jell-o and you try to make a form that sustains in that jell-o. You just cut a
[32:41] sustains in that jell-o. You just cut a
[32:41] sustains in that jell-o. You just cut a balloon of jell-o out of a sea of
[32:42] balloon of jell-o out of a sea of
[32:42] balloon of jell-o out of a sea of jell-o, you got nothing because it sinks
[32:44] jell-o, you got nothing because it sinks
[32:44] jell-o, you got nothing because it sinks back into the jello when you can't tell
[32:45] back into the jello when you can't tell
[32:45] back into the jello when you can't tell where the boundaries were. But if God
[32:48] where the boundaries were. But if God
[32:48] where the boundaries were. But if God goes fat lux, let there be light and
[32:51] goes fat lux, let there be light and
[32:52] goes fat lux, let there be light and puffs into the jello, the jello starts
[32:54] puffs into the jello, the jello starts
[32:54] puffs into the jello, the jello starts to fall through itself and forms a
[32:56] to fall through itself and forms a
[32:56] to fall through itself and forms a toidal vortex.
[32:58] toidal vortex.
[32:58] toidal vortex. Again, as Arthur points out, as I praise
[33:01] Again, as Arthur points out, as I praise
[33:01] Again, as Arthur points out, as I praise points out, that lowest order form that
[33:03] points out, that lowest order form that
[33:03] points out, that lowest order form that can self- sustain, that can be detected,
[33:05] can self- sustain, that can be detected,
[33:05] can self- sustain, that can be detected, that's made of the same material as this
[33:07] that's made of the same material as this
[33:07] that's made of the same material as this cosmic jello is the donut is the tutors.
[33:10] cosmic jello is the donut is the tutors.
[33:10] cosmic jello is the donut is the tutors. So the donut shape is the first
[33:12] So the donut shape is the first
[33:12] So the donut shape is the first distinction in the cosmic goo. And the
[33:15] distinction in the cosmic goo. And the
[33:15] distinction in the cosmic goo. And the tfoil knot, the simple knot,
[33:20] this knot is the small lowest
[33:23] this knot is the small lowest distinction in knot theory. It's the
[33:25] distinction in knot theory. It's the
[33:25] distinction in knot theory. It's the simplest way you can tie a thing so it
[33:27] simplest way you can tie a thing so it
[33:27] simplest way you can tie a thing so it stays tied. Same form.
[33:31] stays tied. Same form.
[33:31] stays tied. Same form. Well, if we then put our alphabet in
[33:34] Well, if we then put our alphabet in
[33:34] Well, if we then put our alphabet in this new order on this form, we discover
[33:38] this new order on this form, we discover
[33:38] this new order on this form, we discover some very interesting things.
[33:41] some very interesting things.
[33:41] some very interesting things. Mostly, we discover that the letters
[33:42] Mostly, we discover that the letters
[33:42] Mostly, we discover that the letters that turn out to be the final letters,
[33:44] that turn out to be the final letters,
[33:44] that turn out to be the final letters, which are these letters M, Z, N, K, and
[33:48] which are these letters M, Z, N, K, and
[33:48] which are these letters M, Z, N, K, and P turn out to be on the extremities of
[33:51] P turn out to be on the extremities of
[33:51] P turn out to be on the extremities of the form.
[33:53] the form.
[33:53] the form. In fact, they are the what you would do.
[33:55] In fact, they are the what you would do.
[33:55] In fact, they are the what you would do. Let's say you wanted to make a
[33:57] Let's say you wanted to make a
[33:57] Let's say you wanted to make a hyperdimensional object, but we only
[34:00] hyperdimensional object, but we only
[34:00] hyperdimensional object, but we only have three dimensions. Normally, what we
[34:02] have three dimensions. Normally, what we
[34:02] have three dimensions. Normally, what we do to make a hyperdimensional object, we
[34:04] do to make a hyperdimensional object, we
[34:04] do to make a hyperdimensional object, we put a little cube inside of a big cube
[34:05] put a little cube inside of a big cube
[34:05] put a little cube inside of a big cube to make a hyper cube. If we could make a
[34:08] to make a hyper cube. If we could make a
[34:08] to make a hyper cube. If we could make a little donut to fit inside of our big
[34:10] little donut to fit inside of our big
[34:10] little donut to fit inside of our big donut, then it would be like extending
[34:11] donut, then it would be like extending
[34:12] donut, then it would be like extending it into the next reality, recurring it,
[34:14] it into the next reality, recurring it,
[34:14] it into the next reality, recurring it, having it go over, spill over to the
[34:15] having it go over, spill over to the
[34:16] having it go over, spill over to the next manifestation from one generation
[34:18] next manifestation from one generation
[34:18] next manifestation from one generation to the next. Well, that's what's going
[34:20] to the next. Well, that's what's going
[34:20] to the next. Well, that's what's going on. The three letters
[34:23] on. The three letters
[34:23] on. The three letters that are on the perimeter, K, M, and N
[34:25] that are on the perimeter, K, M, and N
[34:25] that are on the perimeter, K, M, and N are on the ends of the loop here, here,
[34:27] are on the ends of the loop here, here,
[34:27] are on the ends of the loop here, here, and here. The P is up here and the Z is
[34:31] and here. The P is up here and the Z is
[34:31] and here. The P is up here and the Z is down here. Well, that's nice because P
[34:34] down here. Well, that's nice because P
[34:34] down here. Well, that's nice because P means mouth and Z means tree, more or
[34:36] means mouth and Z means tree, more or
[34:36] means mouth and Z means tree, more or less. We're going to get into that in
[34:37] less. We're going to get into that in
[34:37] less. We're going to get into that in more detail later. And so, you start
[34:39] more detail later. And so, you start
[34:39] more detail later. And so, you start from your mouth to what you stand on,
[34:41] from your mouth to what you stand on,
[34:41] from your mouth to what you stand on, your uprightness, your tree, your body
[34:43] your uprightness, your tree, your body
[34:43] your uprightness, your tree, your body part. And around your perimeter, there
[34:45] part. And around your perimeter, there
[34:45] part. And around your perimeter, there are three. And so what we've done is
[34:47] are three. And so what we've done is
[34:47] are three. And so what we've done is basically make a little itty bitty donut
[34:48] basically make a little itty bitty donut
[34:48] basically make a little itty bitty donut that sort of either sits outside or
[34:50] that sort of either sits outside or
[34:50] that sort of either sits outside or inside the original donut. And those
[34:52] inside the original donut. And those
[34:52] inside the original donut. And those become the final letters.
[34:54] become the final letters.
[34:54] become the final letters. And in fact, it's going to turn out that
[34:56] And in fact, it's going to turn out that
[34:56] And in fact, it's going to turn out that there is a direct relationship between
[34:58] there is a direct relationship between
[34:58] there is a direct relationship between the 22 and the 27. We'll get to that as
[35:00] the 22 and the 27. We'll get to that as
[35:00] the 22 and the 27. We'll get to that as we go on a little further.
[35:03] we go on a little further.
[35:03] we go on a little further. Okay. Now,
[35:05] Okay. Now,
[35:06] Okay. Now, that pretty much catches us up on the
[35:09] that pretty much catches us up on the
[35:09] that pretty much catches us up on the old material. Wait, there's one more
[35:11] old material. Wait, there's one more
[35:11] old material. Wait, there's one more piece I want to do. I guess maybe I
[35:13] piece I want to do. I guess maybe I
[35:13] piece I want to do. I guess maybe I should do it. This is our seven color
[35:15] should do it. This is our seven color
[35:15] should do it. This is our seven color map that makes the uh the Taurus.
[35:18] map that makes the uh the Taurus.
[35:18] map that makes the uh the Taurus. These are the 22 letters that form on
[35:20] These are the 22 letters that form on
[35:20] These are the 22 letters that form on the surface of this this tetrahelix. But
[35:24] the surface of this this tetrahelix. But
[35:24] the surface of this this tetrahelix. But if I open it up this way, it also puts
[35:26] if I open it up this way, it also puts
[35:26] if I open it up this way, it also puts the letters on the surface of the donut.
[35:28] the letters on the surface of the donut.
[35:28] the letters on the surface of the donut. In fact, instead of having seven colors
[35:30] In fact, instead of having seven colors
[35:30] In fact, instead of having seven colors making the donut, I have a sequence of
[35:32] making the donut, I have a sequence of
[35:32] making the donut, I have a sequence of 22 regions, 22 colors if you will, that
[35:35] 22 regions, 22 colors if you will, that
[35:35] 22 regions, 22 colors if you will, that make up the donut. And they can self-
[35:36] make up the donut. And they can self-
[35:36] make up the donut. And they can self- embed each other. I can go make little
[35:39] embed each other. I can go make little
[35:39] embed each other. I can go make little donuts inside of big donuts inside of
[35:41] donuts inside of big donuts inside of
[35:41] donuts inside of big donuts inside of big donuts, etc. So if a donut has seven
[35:44] big donuts, etc. So if a donut has seven
[35:44] big donuts, etc. So if a donut has seven colors, a doughnut of donuts has 49
[35:46] colors, a doughnut of donuts has 49
[35:46] colors, a doughnut of donuts has 49 colors and altogether that's 50 and
[35:49] colors and altogether that's 50 and
[35:49] colors and altogether that's 50 and that's the jubilee and that's another
[35:51] that's the jubilee and that's another
[35:51] that's the jubilee and that's another unit of the system. It's a generation of
[35:53] unit of the system. It's a generation of
[35:53] unit of the system. It's a generation of generations, a life cycle of life
[35:55] generations, a life cycle of life
[35:55] generations, a life cycle of life cycles, if you will.
[35:57] cycles, if you will.
[35:57] cycles, if you will. Okay. Now I want to leave the older
[35:59] Okay. Now I want to leave the older
[35:59] Okay. Now I want to leave the older material and I want to go on to what
[36:02] material and I want to go on to what
[36:02] material and I want to go on to what we've been doing recently which is the
[36:03] we've been doing recently which is the
[36:04] we've been doing recently which is the most exciting part which is what I hope
[36:05] most exciting part which is what I hope
[36:05] most exciting part which is what I hope you guys came for because this is what I
[36:07] you guys came for because this is what I
[36:07] you guys came for because this is what I really um this gets me a little shaky
[36:09] really um this gets me a little shaky
[36:09] really um this gets me a little shaky myself. It's it's too unbelievable. So
[36:12] myself. It's it's too unbelievable. So
[36:12] myself. It's it's too unbelievable. So use your own judgment. I want to read a
[36:15] use your own judgment. I want to read a
[36:15] use your own judgment. I want to read a couple of quotes now. Um just to give a
[36:18] couple of quotes now. Um just to give a
[36:18] couple of quotes now. Um just to give a little background and provide a little
[36:19] little background and provide a little

[37:01] And I don't quite know why he calls it
[37:01] And I don't quite know why he calls it that anymore, but he says something
[37:04] that anymore, but he says something

[41:29] That's what the point of this discussion
[41:31] That's what the point of this discussion is going to be. Now, he's going to give
[41:33] is going to be. Now, he's going to give
[41:33] is going to be. Now, he's going to give us a clue to this um much further along
[41:36] us a clue to this um much further along
[41:36] us a clue to this um much further along in the book. And this is a little out of
[41:38] in the book. And this is a little out of
[41:38] in the book. And this is a little out of context. He's discussing this the the
[41:39] context. He's discussing this the the

[41:42] Mishnat the the chapter in in the in
[41:42] Mishnat the the chapter in in the in sephiatira where they talk about the law
[41:45] sephiatira where they talk about the law

[41:48] of 37 and 12 which is much confused and
[41:48] of 37 and 12 which is much confused and he he covers all the standard
[41:49] he he covers all the standard
[41:50] he he covers all the standard discussions and then he has a curious
[41:51] discussions and then he has a curious
[41:51] discussions and then he has a curious thing to say he says the sequence 3712
[41:55] thing to say he says the sequence 3712
[41:55] thing to say he says the sequence 3712 can be defined in a number of ways one
[41:57] can be defined in a number of ways one
[41:57] can be defined in a number of ways one which we have discussed earlier involved
[41:58] which we have discussed earlier involved
[41:58] which we have discussed earlier involved the lines connecting the ciferat which
[42:00] the lines connecting the ciferat which
[42:00] the lines connecting the ciferat which is on the tree of life on a more
[42:02] is on the tree of life on a more
[42:02] is on the tree of life on a more sophisticated level this sequence can be
[42:04] sophisticated level this sequence can be
[42:04] sophisticated level this sequence can be represented by a triangle a tetrahedrin
[42:08] represented by a triangle a tetrahedrin
[42:08] represented by a triangle a tetrahedrin and a hyper tetrahedrin.
[42:12] Now, that's the model that we're going
[42:14] Now, that's the model that we're going to be addressing here because we're
[42:15] to be addressing here because we're
[42:15] to be addressing here because we're going to go from a low dimensional state
[42:17] going to go from a low dimensional state
[42:18] going to go from a low dimensional state to a higher dimensional state and then
[42:19] to a higher dimensional state and then
[42:19] to a higher dimensional state and then collapse back to the low dimensional
[42:21] collapse back to the low dimensional
[42:21] collapse back to the low dimensional state and start over. One of the most
[42:23] state and start over. One of the most
[42:23] state and start over. One of the most intriguing and interesting thing about
[42:25] intriguing and interesting thing about
[42:25] intriguing and interesting thing about Arthur's theory is that you only need
[42:28] Arthur's theory is that you only need
[42:28] Arthur's theory is that you only need 3.9999
[42:29] 3.9999
[42:29] 3.9999 dimensions to do everything in because
[42:31] dimensions to do everything in because
[42:31] dimensions to do everything in because when you hit four dimensions, you're
[42:32] when you hit four dimensions, you're
[42:32] when you hit four dimensions, you're already back in the beginning. You
[42:34] already back in the beginning. You
[42:34] already back in the beginning. You really don't have to go above it as the
[42:35] really don't have to go above it as the
[42:35] really don't have to go above it as the physicists do. What you have to do is
[42:37] physicists do. What you have to do is
[42:37] physicists do. What you have to do is remember to self- embed at the right
[42:38] remember to self- embed at the right
[42:38] remember to self- embed at the right place. So if you start with a point
[42:43] place. So if you start with a point
[42:43] place. So if you start with a point and you open up to a triangle to a
[42:45] and you open up to a triangle to a
[42:45] and you open up to a triangle to a tetrahedrron, by the time you get to a
[42:47] tetrahedrron, by the time you get to a
[42:47] tetrahedrron, by the time you get to a hyperteted, you're back to the point
[42:48] hyperteted, you're back to the point
[42:48] hyperteted, you're back to the point again.
[42:50] again.
[42:50] again. And that's what this mathematics and
[42:52] And that's what this mathematics and
[42:52] And that's what this mathematics and some of the the drawings up here are
[42:53] some of the the drawings up here are
[42:53] some of the the drawings up here are hopefully going to help us to see.
[42:56] hopefully going to help us to see.
[42:56] hopefully going to help us to see. Okay. Um continuing further,
[43:00] Okay. Um continuing further,
[43:00] Okay. Um continuing further, let's examine this process a little more
[43:02] let's examine this process a little more
[43:02] let's examine this process a little more closely. Let's look at
[43:05] closely. Let's look at
[43:05] closely. Let's look at the process
[43:07] the process
[43:07] the process of this opening up from low dimension to
[43:12] of this opening up from low dimension to
[43:12] of this opening up from low dimension to high dimension and and and self-
[43:13] high dimension and and and self-
[43:13] high dimension and and and self- embedment again.
[43:15] embedment again.
[43:15] embedment again. Um
[43:18] Um
[43:18] Um there are several different ways we can
[43:20] there are several different ways we can
[43:20] there are several different ways we can understand that and it's a little hard
[43:22] understand that and it's a little hard
[43:22] understand that and it's a little hard to know where to start. So I guess I
[43:23] to know where to start. So I guess I
[43:23] to know where to start. So I guess I have to start from what I found and work
[43:25] have to start from what I found and work
[43:25] have to start from what I found and work backwards to save time. There are 27
[43:28] backwards to save time. There are 27

[44:28] onto 27 points in complex three-dimensional space on
[44:31] in complex three-dimensional space on
[44:31] in complex three-dimensional space on the surface of a fivedimensional sphere
[44:33] the surface of a fivedimensional sphere
[44:34] the surface of a fivedimensional sphere whatever that means. What we're going to
[44:36] whatever that means. What we're going to
[44:36] whatever that means. What we're going to discover is you don't need all these
[44:38] discover is you don't need all these
[44:38] discover is you don't need all these dimensions to do it if you figure out
[44:40] dimensions to do it if you figure out
[44:40] dimensions to do it if you figure out what these dimensions are about. And
[44:42] what these dimensions are about. And
[44:42] what these dimensions are about. And that's the key.
[44:44] that's the key.
[44:44] that's the key. See, we're looking at a system that
[44:46] See, we're looking at a system that
[44:46] See, we're looking at a system that unfurs seed fruit new seed fruit layer
[44:51] unfurs seed fruit new seed fruit layer
[44:51] unfurs seed fruit new seed fruit layer on layer. Acorn, oak tree, acorn, oak
[44:53] on layer. Acorn, oak tree, acorn, oak
[44:53] on layer. Acorn, oak tree, acorn, oak tree unfurling from from the beginning
[44:54] tree unfurling from from the beginning
[44:54] tree unfurling from from the beginning of time all the way. And so our system
[44:58] of time all the way. And so our system
[44:58] of time all the way. And so our system is concentric. This is what I I was
[44:59] is concentric. This is what I I was
[45:00] is concentric. This is what I I was saying before when I was reading the
[45:01] saying before when I was reading the
[45:01] saying before when I was reading the earlier quote about the idea of
[45:03] earlier quote about the idea of
[45:03] earlier quote about the idea of concentric eusions of consciousness. The
[45:05] concentric eusions of consciousness. The
[45:06] concentric eusions of consciousness. The idea we've all seen italistic in the
[45:08] idea we've all seen italistic in the
[45:08] idea we've all seen italistic in the mystical text of these concentric shells
[45:10] mystical text of these concentric shells
[45:10] mystical text of these concentric shells that they draw like an onion. They say
[45:12] that they draw like an onion. They say
[45:12] that they draw like an onion. They say the world is like concentric shells.
[45:15] the world is like concentric shells.
[45:15] the world is like concentric shells. Well, if we've got a concentric system,
[45:17] Well, if we've got a concentric system,
[45:17] Well, if we've got a concentric system, then we can do some tricks. We can
[45:19] then we can do some tricks. We can
[45:19] then we can do some tricks. We can reduce a higher dimensional system to a
[45:20] reduce a higher dimensional system to a
[45:20] reduce a higher dimensional system to a lower dimensional system without losing
[45:22] lower dimensional system without losing
[45:22] lower dimensional system without losing any of the symmetry. If we reduce it
[45:24] any of the symmetry. If we reduce it
[45:24] any of the symmetry. If we reduce it along the radius, we collapse
[45:26] along the radius, we collapse
[45:26] along the radius, we collapse concentrically.
[45:29] concentrically.
[45:29] concentrically. Everything shrinks in and we're out. And
[45:31] Everything shrinks in and we're out. And
[45:31] Everything shrinks in and we're out. And so the symmetry stay the same.
[45:34] so the symmetry stay the same.
[45:34] so the symmetry stay the same. Well, let's do it and see what happens.
[45:37] Well, let's do it and see what happens.
[45:37] Well, let's do it and see what happens. Let's let's let's find out what happens.
[45:41] Let's let's let's find out what happens.
[45:41] Let's let's let's find out what happens. Um, what I want to present is a new way
[45:43] Um, what I want to present is a new way
[45:43] Um, what I want to present is a new way of displaying imaginary reality. And I
[45:47] of displaying imaginary reality. And I
[45:47] of displaying imaginary reality. And I want to identify it. In high school,
[45:49] want to identify it. In high school,
[45:49] want to identify it. In high school, we're taught that one can have a complex
[45:52] we're taught that one can have a complex
[45:52] we're taught that one can have a complex plane.
[45:53] plane.
[45:53] plane. We can have an x-axis and then we can
[45:55] We can have an x-axis and then we can
[45:55] We can have an x-axis and then we can have an iixaxis perpendicular to it. An
[45:58] have an iixaxis perpendicular to it. An
[45:58] have an iixaxis perpendicular to it. An imaginary axis perpendicular right
[46:00] imaginary axis perpendicular right
[46:00] imaginary axis perpendicular right angles to the real.
[46:03] angles to the real.
[46:03] angles to the real. That's a convention. It doesn't have to
[46:05] That's a convention. It doesn't have to
[46:05] That's a convention. It doesn't have to be at right angles. Mathematicians like
[46:07] be at right angles. Mathematicians like
[46:08] be at right angles. Mathematicians like to draw at right angles because that
[46:09] to draw at right angles because that
[46:09] to draw at right angles because that makes it simple for us to see that the
[46:10] makes it simple for us to see that the
[46:10] makes it simple for us to see that the two directions are independent or
[46:12] two directions are independent or
[46:12] two directions are independent or orthogonal.
[46:13] orthogonal.
[46:14] orthogonal. But what if we were to say that the
[46:15] But what if we were to say that the
[46:16] But what if we were to say that the imaginary is in our imagination, is
[46:19] imaginary is in our imagination, is
[46:19] imaginary is in our imagination, is inside,
[46:20] inside,
[46:20] inside, and that the real is real is the world.
[46:24] and that the real is real is the world.
[46:24] and that the real is real is the world. And so instead of rotating 90° to get
[46:27] And so instead of rotating 90° to get
[46:27] And so instead of rotating 90° to get between imaginary and real, let's say we
[46:29] between imaginary and real, let's say we
[46:29] between imaginary and real, let's say we were to go between inside and outside.
[46:32] were to go between inside and outside.
[46:32] were to go between inside and outside. But of course, if we were to simply make
[46:33] But of course, if we were to simply make
[46:33] But of course, if we were to simply make two coordinate systems and they were
[46:35] two coordinate systems and they were
[46:35] two coordinate systems and they were coincident with each other, then we
[46:37] coincident with each other, then we
[46:37] coincident with each other, then we wouldn't be able to tell anything.
[46:38] wouldn't be able to tell anything.
[46:38] wouldn't be able to tell anything. They'd be all blurred together. But we
[46:40] They'd be all blurred together. But we
[46:40] They'd be all blurred together. But we know in nature the relationship, the
[46:42] know in nature the relationship, the
[46:42] know in nature the relationship, the geometric relationship of inside to
[46:44] geometric relationship of inside to
[46:44] geometric relationship of inside to outside because we know in nature, let's
[46:46] outside because we know in nature, let's
[46:46] outside because we know in nature, let's see if I've got it up here someplace.
[46:48] see if I've got it up here someplace.
[46:48] see if I've got it up here someplace. It's a little symbol, but you can see
[46:49] It's a little symbol, but you can see
[46:49] It's a little symbol, but you can see it. We know about the nautilus shell. We
[46:51] it. We know about the nautilus shell. We
[46:51] it. We know about the nautilus shell. We know about the golden mean function.
[46:54] know about the golden mean function.
[46:54] know about the golden mean function. We know that as nature unfurs things,
[46:58] We know that as nature unfurs things,
[46:58] We know that as nature unfurs things, nature unfurs things in golden mean
[47:00] nature unfurs things in golden mean
[47:00] nature unfurs things in golden mean proportions. And the inside is one over
[47:04] proportions. And the inside is one over
[47:04] proportions. And the inside is one over the golden mean as big as the outside.
[47:07] the golden mean as big as the outside.
[47:07] the golden mean as big as the outside. and it continues to unfurl in golden
[47:09] and it continues to unfurl in golden
[47:09] and it continues to unfurl in golden mean proportion. So if we were to make a
[47:11] mean proportion. So if we were to make a
[47:11] mean proportion. So if we were to make a plane instead of making an imaginary
[47:13] plane instead of making an imaginary
[47:13] plane instead of making an imaginary plane that has a real axis and an
[47:16] plane that has a real axis and an
[47:16] plane that has a real axis and an imaginary axis at right angles, what if
[47:18] imaginary axis at right angles, what if
[47:18] imaginary axis at right angles, what if we were to make the real and the
[47:19] we were to make the real and the
[47:19] we were to make the real and the imaginary direction the same but make
[47:22] imaginary direction the same but make
[47:22] imaginary direction the same but make the imaginary direction shorter in
[47:25] the imaginary direction shorter in
[47:25] the imaginary direction shorter in scale? Have it only be 6/10 as big one
[47:29] scale? Have it only be 6/10 as big one
[47:29] scale? Have it only be 6/10 as big one over the golden name. Then instead of
[47:31] over the golden name. Then instead of
[47:31] over the golden name. Then instead of getting rectangular squares as our
[47:36] getting rectangular squares as our
[47:36] getting rectangular squares as our surfaces in three dimensions, we would
[47:39] surfaces in three dimensions, we would
[47:39] surfaces in three dimensions, we would get well actually these are not bad
[47:40] get well actually these are not bad
[47:40] get well actually these are not bad because that's why the design of the
[47:41] because that's why the design of the
[47:41] because that's why the design of the paper. We would get golden mean
[47:43] paper. We would get golden mean
[47:43] paper. We would get golden mean rectangles as planes. The imaginary one
[47:46] rectangles as planes. The imaginary one
[47:46] rectangles as planes. The imaginary one being shortened and the real axis being
[47:48] being shortened and the real axis being
[47:48] being shortened and the real axis being lengthened. And if we were operating in
[47:50] lengthened. And if we were operating in
[47:50] lengthened. And if we were operating in sixdimensional space, we would have an
[47:53] sixdimensional space, we would have an
[47:53] sixdimensional space, we would have an interpenetration
[47:55] interpenetration
[47:55] interpenetration of three of these golden mean planes.
[47:58] of three of these golden mean planes.
[47:58] of three of these golden mean planes. And there they are. And each one of
[48:01] And there they are. And each one of
[48:01] And there they are. And each one of these is an imaginary plane. One is an x
[48:03] these is an imaginary plane. One is an x
[48:03] these is an imaginary plane. One is an x and x x and ix, y and i y, z and i z if
[48:07] and x x and ix, y and i y, z and i z if
[48:07] and x x and ix, y and i y, z and i z if you want. There are other ways one can
[48:08] you want. There are other ways one can
[48:08] you want. There are other ways one can arrange it. And what you'd end up with
[48:10] arrange it. And what you'd end up with
[48:10] arrange it. And what you'd end up with is of course a sphere and a kosahhedral
[48:14] is of course a sphere and a kosahhedral
[48:14] is of course a sphere and a kosahhedral sphere.
[48:16] sphere.
[48:16] sphere. And if you were to look what you can do
[48:18] And if you were to look what you can do
[48:18] And if you were to look what you can do with it, you can literally put these
[48:20] with it, you can literally put these
[48:20] with it, you can literally put these vortex forms on both faces of the golden
[48:23] vortex forms on both faces of the golden
[48:23] vortex forms on both faces of the golden mean triangles of golden mean rectangle
[48:25] mean triangles of golden mean rectangle
[48:25] mean triangles of golden mean rectangle showing how they unfurl and you end up
[48:28] showing how they unfurl and you end up
[48:28] showing how they unfurl and you end up having this icosahedron
[48:30] having this icosahedron
[48:30] having this icosahedron representing complex three-dimensional
[48:33] representing complex three-dimensional
[48:33] representing complex three-dimensional coordinate system. And then this
[48:36] coordinate system. And then this
[48:36] coordinate system. And then this iicosahedron is our equivalent of the
[48:38] iicosahedron is our equivalent of the
[48:38] iicosahedron is our equivalent of the five-dimensional sphere. And all we have
[48:40] five-dimensional sphere. And all we have
[48:40] five-dimensional sphere. And all we have to figure out then is how we can arrange
[48:44] to figure out then is how we can arrange
[48:44] to figure out then is how we can arrange 27 points evenly
[48:47] 27 points evenly
[48:47] 27 points evenly [Applause]
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:50] [Applause] on this complex three-dimensional
[48:54] on this complex three-dimensional
[48:54] on this complex three-dimensional form.
[48:55] form.
[48:55] form. Well, figure it out. We've got 27 points
[48:58] Well, figure it out. We've got 27 points
[48:58] Well, figure it out. We've got 27 points and they have to be evenly arrayed. Why
[49:01] and they have to be evenly arrayed. Why
[49:01] and they have to be evenly arrayed. Why evenly? Because that's the whole point
[49:02] evenly? Because that's the whole point
[49:02] evenly? Because that's the whole point of the 27. They're evenly arrayed on the
[49:05] of the 27. They're evenly arrayed on the
[49:05] of the 27. They're evenly arrayed on the sphere. There are fundamental directions
[49:07] sphere. There are fundamental directions
[49:07] sphere. There are fundamental directions on this hyperdimensional supposedly
[49:09] on this hyperdimensional supposedly
[49:09] on this hyperdimensional supposedly hyperdimensional sphere. It's not so
[49:11] hyperdimensional sphere. It's not so
[49:11] hyperdimensional sphere. It's not so hyperdimensional anymore because we can
[49:12] hyperdimensional anymore because we can
[49:12] hyperdimensional anymore because we can see it. If they're evenly arranged and
[49:15] see it. If they're evenly arranged and
[49:15] see it. If they're evenly arranged and there are six dimensions, then there
[49:18] there are six dimensions, then there
[49:18] there are six dimensions, then there must be 27 / 6 points in each dimension.
[49:24] must be 27 / 6 points in each dimension.
[49:24] must be 27 / 6 points in each dimension. Very simple. What other choice is there?
[49:26] Very simple. What other choice is there?
[49:26] Very simple. What other choice is there? But 27 doesn't divide by six. You get
[49:29] But 27 doesn't divide by six. You get
[49:29] But 27 doesn't divide by six. You get four and a half points per dimension. He
[49:31] four and a half points per dimension. He
[49:31] four and a half points per dimension. He can't have a half a point. Even if Bart
[49:33] can't have a half a point. Even if Bart
[49:33] can't have a half a point. Even if Bart could slice his points in half, we can't
[49:35] could slice his points in half, we can't
[49:35] could slice his points in half, we can't cut our seed in half because the plant
[49:37] cut our seed in half because the plant
[49:37] cut our seed in half because the plant will die. There's no half points in this
[49:40] will die. There's no half points in this
[49:40] will die. There's no half points in this system. They're quantum. Quantum of
[49:42] system. They're quantum. Quantum of
[49:42] system. They're quantum. Quantum of action actually in Arthur's terms.
[49:46] action actually in Arthur's terms.
[49:46] action actually in Arthur's terms. So that means that the dimensions must
[49:48] So that means that the dimensions must
[49:48] So that means that the dimensions must be paired. That means we have to have
[49:50] be paired. That means we have to have
[49:50] be paired. That means we have to have nine points in each of three
[49:55] nine points in each of three
[49:55] nine points in each of three planes
[49:57] planes
[49:57] planes surfaces rather than four and a half
[49:59] surfaces rather than four and a half
[49:59] surfaces rather than four and a half points in each of
[50:02] points in each of
[50:02] points in each of six lines, six linear dimensions.
[50:06] six lines, six linear dimensions.
[50:06] six lines, six linear dimensions. Well, that sort of does the trick
[50:09] Well, that sort of does the trick
[50:09] Well, that sort of does the trick because that tells us that the
[50:11] because that tells us that the
[50:12] because that tells us that the dimensions have to be paired into these
[50:13] dimensions have to be paired into these
[50:13] dimensions have to be paired into these planes. And that tells us that what we
[50:16] planes. And that tells us that what we
[50:16] planes. And that tells us that what we really have to have, let's see if I can
[50:18] really have to have, let's see if I can
[50:18] really have to have, let's see if I can find it,
[50:21] find it,
[50:21] find it, is on each of the planes, we have to
[50:23] is on each of the planes, we have to
[50:23] is on each of the planes, we have to have this little vortex shape that's
[50:24] have this little vortex shape that's
[50:24] have this little vortex shape that's going to have nine points on it. And
[50:26] going to have nine points on it. And
[50:26] going to have nine points on it. And we're going to have three of them to
[50:28] we're going to have three of them to
[50:28] we're going to have three of them to penetrate each other. And you've seen
[50:29] penetrate each other. And you've seen
[50:29] penetrate each other. And you've seen this from the previous lectures. This
[50:31] this from the previous lectures. This
[50:31] this from the previous lectures. This I'm calling a shushin flower which is
[50:33] I'm calling a shushin flower which is
[50:33] I'm calling a shushin flower which is what's described in the introduction to
[50:34] what's described in the introduction to
[50:34] what's described in the introduction to the zohar. And what you can see it comes
[50:36] the zohar. And what you can see it comes
[50:36] the zohar. And what you can see it comes from is that these are three loops here.
[50:39] from is that these are three loops here.
[50:39] from is that these are three loops here. And what they really are nothing but
[50:41] And what they really are nothing but
[50:41] And what they really are nothing but these three loops but curled up some
[50:43] these three loops but curled up some
[50:43] these three loops but curled up some more.
[50:45] more.
[50:45] more. So this is just a curled up version of
[50:47] So this is just a curled up version of
[50:47] So this is just a curled up version of this.
[50:50] this.
[50:50] this. And this form somehow has to have these
[50:52] And this form somehow has to have these
[50:52] And this form somehow has to have these 27 points array on it. Well, that's
[50:54] 27 points array on it. Well, that's
[50:54] 27 points array on it. Well, that's exactly what we've done. You see, if you
[50:56] exactly what we've done. You see, if you
[50:56] exactly what we've done. You see, if you take the form and you put the Hebrew
[50:59] take the form and you put the Hebrew
[50:59] take the form and you put the Hebrew letters on them on, this this this round
[51:02] letters on them on, this this this round
[51:02] letters on them on, this this this round cube is supposedly be this, but
[51:04] cube is supposedly be this, but
[51:04] cube is supposedly be this, but something I could write on the olive,
[51:06] something I could write on the olive,
[51:06] something I could write on the olive, the yud, and the coup. The central
[51:07] the yud, and the coup. The central
[51:08] the yud, and the coup. The central letters are actually in the middle in
[51:09] letters are actually in the middle in
[51:09] letters are actually in the middle in that center point.
[51:11] that center point.
[51:12] that center point. Then you've got a uniform distribution
[51:14] Then you've got a uniform distribution
[51:14] Then you've got a uniform distribution of the 27 letters in a way that's
[51:16] of the 27 letters in a way that's
[51:16] of the 27 letters in a way that's completely analogous to the way the
[51:18] completely analogous to the way the
[51:18] completely analogous to the way the mathematicians have distributed the 27
[51:21] mathematicians have distributed the 27
[51:21] mathematicians have distributed the 27 points.
[51:23] points.
[51:23] points. Now, Consider shows this in two
[51:25] Now, Consider shows this in two
[51:25] Now, Consider shows this in two different ways. He shows an anagonal
[51:29] different ways. He shows an anagonal
[51:29] different ways. He shows an anagonal projection which is three concentric
[51:32] projection which is three concentric
[51:32] projection which is three concentric sets of nine. Very hard to project these
[51:35] sets of nine. Very hard to project these
[51:35] sets of nine. Very hard to project these hyperdimensional objects. He shows a
[51:37] hyperdimensional objects. He shows a
[51:37] hyperdimensional objects. He shows a docal
[51:39] docal
[51:39] docal version which is two rings of 12 and
[51:41] version which is two rings of 12 and
[51:41] version which is two rings of 12 and then three stacked up in the middle.
[51:46] And in discussion with S Paul sak and
[51:49] And in discussion with S Paul sak and others we've come to the conclusion that
[51:52] others we've come to the conclusion that
[51:52] others we've come to the conclusion that if you
[51:54] if you
[51:54] if you have these forms they also define
[51:57] have these forms they also define
[51:57] have these forms they also define in some very fundamental way Roger

[51:59] in some very fundamental way Roger Penrose's twister.
[52:01] Penrose's twister.
[52:02] Penrose's twister. Now where do we get the twister from?
[52:03] Now where do we get the twister from?
[52:03] Now where do we get the twister from? Here we're dealing with these these
[52:04] Here we're dealing with these these
[52:04] Here we're dealing with these these hyperspherical things. And here we've
[52:06] hyperspherical things. And here we've
[52:06] hyperspherical things. And here we've got this this set of nested donuts.
[52:08] got this this set of nested donuts.
[52:08] got this this set of nested donuts. Well, again, it's Arthur that pointed
[52:10] Well, again, it's Arthur that pointed
[52:10] Well, again, it's Arthur that pointed out that a solid Taurus in three
[52:13] out that a solid Taurus in three
[52:14] out that a solid Taurus in three dimensions is equivalent in many ways to
[52:17] dimensions is equivalent in many ways to
[52:17] dimensions is equivalent in many ways to a sphere in four dimensions.
[52:20] a sphere in four dimensions.
[52:20] a sphere in four dimensions. And so what we've got here is a sphere,
[52:23] And so what we've got here is a sphere,
[52:23] And so what we've got here is a sphere, a hypersphere, except it doesn't have to
[52:25] a hypersphere, except it doesn't have to
[52:25] a hypersphere, except it doesn't have to be in hyperdimensions. If we make three
[52:27] be in hyperdimensions. If we make three
[52:27] be in hyperdimensions. If we make three levels of donut, why three levels?
[52:31] levels of donut, why three levels?
[52:31] levels of donut, why three levels? Because we've got to have an inside, an
[52:33] Because we've got to have an inside, an
[52:33] Because we've got to have an inside, an outside, and an in between.
[52:37] outside, and an in between.
[52:37] outside, and an in between. Now we're getting someplace because now
[52:40] Now we're getting someplace because now
[52:40] Now we're getting someplace because now what we can do is we can come over here
[52:42] what we can do is we can come over here
[52:42] what we can do is we can come over here and we can look at the turret, the
[52:45] and we can look at the turret, the
[52:45] and we can look at the turret, the reflexive turret, which folks that are
[52:48] reflexive turret, which folks that are
[52:48] reflexive turret, which folks that are here tonight are probably familiar with.
[52:50] here tonight are probably familiar with.
[52:50] here tonight are probably familiar with. Now, I'm not saying these are the same
[52:52] Now, I'm not saying these are the same
[52:52] Now, I'm not saying these are the same categories. We're dealing with a
[52:53] categories. We're dealing with a
[52:54] categories. We're dealing with a topological situation here and we can
[52:55] topological situation here and we can
[52:55] topological situation here and we can make any number of sets of categories,
[52:57] make any number of sets of categories,
[52:57] make any number of sets of categories, but I'm saying that whichever categories
[52:59] but I'm saying that whichever categories
[52:59] but I'm saying that whichever categories we use are going to be isomorphic to
[53:01] we use are going to be isomorphic to
[53:02] we use are going to be isomorphic to this set that Arthur has used. I just
[53:03] this set that Arthur has used. I just
[53:03] this set that Arthur has used. I just pulled this out out of um the appendix
[53:05] pulled this out out of um the appendix
[53:05] pulled this out out of um the appendix 3lex of universe I believe. Yeah, out of
[53:07] 3lex of universe I believe. Yeah, out of
[53:07] 3lex of universe I believe. Yeah, out of appendix one. And the whole beauty of
[53:09] appendix one. And the whole beauty of
[53:10] appendix one. And the whole beauty of this is that just like on the donut,
[53:12] this is that just like on the donut,
[53:12] this is that just like on the donut, it's symmetrical. The in and the out
[53:15] it's symmetrical. The in and the out
[53:15] it's symmetrical. The in and the out parts are reciprocal. And every level is
[53:20] parts are reciprocal. And every level is
[53:20] parts are reciprocal. And every level is reciprocal. And we've got these four
[53:22] reciprocal. And we've got these four
[53:22] reciprocal. And we've got these four levels.
[53:23] levels.
[53:23] levels. In fact, I don't have it here and I
[53:25] In fact, I don't have it here and I
[53:26] In fact, I don't have it here and I haven't worked it out in detail, but I
[53:27] haven't worked it out in detail, but I
[53:27] haven't worked it out in detail, but I think we can compare these four levels
[53:29] think we can compare these four levels
[53:29] think we can compare these four levels to the four letters of the four-letter
[53:31] to the four letters of the four-letter
[53:31] to the four letters of the four-letter name of God.
[53:33] name of God.
[53:33] name of God. In fact, there's even one that repeats.
[53:35] In fact, there's even one that repeats.
[53:35] In fact, there's even one that repeats. You see, because this this idea here,
[53:37] You see, because this this idea here,
[53:37] You see, because this this idea here, this middle one, which I'm calling
[53:40] this middle one, which I'm calling
[53:40] this middle one, which I'm calling action together, is actually part of
[53:43] action together, is actually part of
[53:43] action together, is actually part of this this one, this one, which I'm
[53:44] this this one, this one, which I'm
[53:44] this this one, this one, which I'm calling action within and action
[53:46] calling action within and action
[53:46] calling action within and action projection. And we're going to get that
[53:48] projection. And we're going to get that
[53:48] projection. And we're going to get that in a minute. So that in fact, we could
[53:50] in a minute. So that in fact, we could
[53:50] in a minute. So that in fact, we could really do it with the four-letter name.
[53:52] really do it with the four-letter name.
[53:52] really do it with the four-letter name. Very compactable. And we could use the
[53:54] Very compactable. And we could use the
[53:54] Very compactable. And we could use the four-letter name to generate our
[53:56] four-letter name to generate our
[53:56] four-letter name to generate our fundamental tetrahedrin. And our
[53:58] fundamental tetrahedrin. And our
[53:58] fundamental tetrahedrin. And our tetrahedrin is going to open up into
[54:00] tetrahedrin is going to open up into
[54:00] tetrahedrin is going to open up into this hyper tetrahedrin. And in a sense,
[54:03] this hyper tetrahedrin. And in a sense,
[54:03] this hyper tetrahedrin. And in a sense, it is a hyperteted.
[54:06] it is a hyperteted.
[54:06] it is a hyperteted. Now, not only that, but let's let's
[54:07] Now, not only that, but let's let's
[54:08] Now, not only that, but let's let's figure out another thing besides the
[54:09] figure out another thing besides the
[54:09] figure out another thing besides the twister, which we now know comes in
[54:10] twister, which we now know comes in
[54:10] twister, which we now know comes in three lay layers. The twister and the
[54:13] three lay layers. The twister and the
[54:14] three lay layers. The twister and the orbold from super string theory are not
[54:16] orbold from super string theory are not
[54:16] orbold from super string theory are not the same objects. They're not the same
[54:19] the same objects. They're not the same
[54:19] the same objects. They're not the same thing, but they partake of the same
[54:21] thing, but they partake of the same
[54:21] thing, but they partake of the same topology. And the fundamental object in
[54:24] topology. And the fundamental object in
[54:24] topology. And the fundamental object in super string space is this twister form
[54:28] super string space is this twister form
[54:28] super string space is this twister form which in complex three dimensions has 27
[54:31] which in complex three dimensions has 27
[54:31] which in complex three dimensions has 27 corners to it.
[54:34] corners to it.
[54:34] corners to it. Now the low order form looks very
[54:36] Now the low order form looks very
[54:36] Now the low order form looks very suspiciously like our alphabet
[54:39] suspiciously like our alphabet
[54:39] suspiciously like our alphabet generator. After all it's a donut with a
[54:41] generator. After all it's a donut with a
[54:41] generator. After all it's a donut with a hole in the middle, a spin axis and
[54:43] hole in the middle, a spin axis and
[54:43] hole in the middle, a spin axis and three singularities.
[54:45] three singularities.
[54:45] three singularities. I think that you can see the similarity
[54:47] I think that you can see the similarity
[54:47] I think that you can see the similarity here. This is the hole and these are the
[54:49] here. This is the hole and these are the
[54:49] here. This is the hole and these are the three singularities. And if it was in a
[54:50] three singularities. And if it was in a
[54:50] three singularities. And if it was in a hyperdimensional space according to the
[54:52] hyperdimensional space according to the
[54:52] hyperdimensional space according to the mathematicians there would be 27 of
[54:54] mathematicians there would be 27 of
[54:54] mathematicians there would be 27 of these singularities and they would be in
[54:56] these singularities and they would be in
[54:56] these singularities and they would be in the same form the same relationship as
[54:59] the same form the same relationship as
[54:59] the same form the same relationship as the 27 points in complex three
[55:01] the 27 points in complex three
[55:01] the 27 points in complex three dimensions which is what they're saying
[55:03] dimensions which is what they're saying
[55:03] dimensions which is what they're saying there or the 27 lines in four dimensions
[55:07] there or the 27 lines in four dimensions
[55:07] there or the 27 lines in four dimensions which are intrinsic in the point itself.
[55:10] which are intrinsic in the point itself.
[55:10] which are intrinsic in the point itself. It's going to get easier folks. Bear
[55:12] It's going to get easier folks. Bear
[55:12] It's going to get easier folks. Bear with me a little longer. I know this is
[55:13] with me a little longer. I know this is
[55:13] with me a little longer. I know this is going all over the place with numbers
[55:14] going all over the place with numbers
[55:14] going all over the place with numbers and for the purposes of time I really
[55:16] and for the purposes of time I really
[55:16] and for the purposes of time I really can't do all the details. It's more a
[55:18] can't do all the details. It's more a
[55:18] can't do all the details. It's more a matter of just showing it.
[55:21] matter of just showing it.
[55:21] matter of just showing it. Okay.
[55:24] Okay.
[55:24] Okay. So, what are we to make of this? And
[55:25] So, what are we to make of this? And
[55:25] So, what are we to make of this? And what does this tell us?
[55:28] what does this tell us?
[55:28] what does this tell us? Well, it gives us a hint as to what's
[55:29] Well, it gives us a hint as to what's
[55:30] Well, it gives us a hint as to what's going on with the alphabet. Because if
[55:31] going on with the alphabet. Because if
[55:31] going on with the alphabet. Because if we make the presumption that the 27
[55:34] we make the presumption that the 27
[55:34] we make the presumption that the 27 letters and these 27 lines or 27 points
[55:37] letters and these 27 lines or 27 points
[55:38] letters and these 27 lines or 27 points are the same, then we should try to see
[55:40] are the same, then we should try to see
[55:40] are the same, then we should try to see if there's some underlying logic that
[55:42] if there's some underlying logic that
[55:42] if there's some underlying logic that holds the two in common. Well, we know
[55:45] holds the two in common. Well, we know
[55:45] holds the two in common. Well, we know the logic of the ideal mathematical
[55:48] the logic of the ideal mathematical
[55:48] the logic of the ideal mathematical forms. This is a very very symmetrical
[55:51] forms. This is a very very symmetrical
[55:51] forms. This is a very very symmetrical 3x3x3 system in this hyperdimensional
[55:54] 3x3x3 system in this hyperdimensional
[55:54] 3x3x3 system in this hyperdimensional space. What if the alphabet were the
[55:57] space. What if the alphabet were the
[55:57] space. What if the alphabet were the same way? What would it look like? Well,
[55:59] same way? What would it look like? Well,
[55:59] same way? What would it look like? Well, it would have three levels to it
[56:01] it would have three levels to it
[56:01] it would have three levels to it and that's what we find in the alphabet.
[56:03] and that's what we find in the alphabet.
[56:03] and that's what we find in the alphabet. And I think that's what we want to go to
[56:05] And I think that's what we want to go to
[56:05] And I think that's what we want to go to next. I want to check my notes to make
[56:06] next. I want to check my notes to make
[56:06] next. I want to check my notes to make sure I haven't skipped anything.
[56:11] Now, if we can back up and make a
[56:14] Now, if we can back up and make a language out of all of this and see if
[56:17] language out of all of this and see if
[56:17] language out of all of this and see if we can figure out what the issue is.
[56:21] we can figure out what the issue is.
[56:21] we can figure out what the issue is. Look, to make a language,
[56:24] Look, to make a language,
[56:24] Look, to make a language, a universal language, which is what
[56:26] a universal language, which is what
[56:26] a universal language, which is what we're trying to make because that's what
[56:27] we're trying to make because that's what
[56:27] we're trying to make because that's what the religious traditions claim that's
[56:30] the religious traditions claim that's
[56:30] the religious traditions claim that's what the sacred alphabet is supposed to
[56:32] what the sacred alphabet is supposed to
[56:32] what the sacred alphabet is supposed to be for. It has to be common to all
[56:34] be for. It has to be common to all
[56:34] be for. It has to be common to all consciousness. It has to be very
[56:37] consciousness. It has to be very
[56:37] consciousness. It has to be very elegant.
[56:39] elegant.
[56:39] elegant. Um,
[56:40] Um,
[56:40] Um, and it has to do what language does.
[56:42] and it has to do what language does.
[56:42] and it has to do what language does. What does language do? What does
[56:44] What does language do? What does
[56:44] What does language do? What does language do? What does language do?
[56:46] language do? What does language do?
[56:46] language do? What does language do? Right? You point at something. You name
[56:48] Right? You point at something. You name
[56:48] Right? You point at something. You name something. You you you have to if I if I
[56:52] something. You you you have to if I if I
[56:52] something. You you you have to if I if I were walking around and I pointed to
[56:54] were walking around and I pointed to
[56:54] were walking around and I pointed to this thing
[56:57] this thing
[56:57] this thing and I wanted to tell you about this
[56:58] and I wanted to tell you about this
[56:58] and I wanted to tell you about this thing, I could call you into the room
[56:59] thing, I could call you into the room
[56:59] thing, I could call you into the room and I could point to that thing again.
[57:01] and I could point to that thing again.
[57:01] and I could point to that thing again. But if you weren't in the room and I
[57:03] But if you weren't in the room and I
[57:03] But if you weren't in the room and I didn't want to do that, I could make a
[57:04] didn't want to do that, I could make a
[57:04] didn't want to do that, I could make a drawing of it maybe or I could make a
[57:07] drawing of it maybe or I could make a
[57:07] drawing of it maybe or I could make a noise. How am I supposed to know what
[57:09] noise. How am I supposed to know what
[57:09] noise. How am I supposed to know what noise to make?
[57:12] Well, here's the theory. This is what
[57:15] Well, here's the theory. This is what we're going to go with.
[57:17] we're going to go with.
[57:18] we're going to go with. This is a non-llinguistic theory. This
[57:19] This is a non-llinguistic theory. This
[57:19] This is a non-llinguistic theory. This is a non-drift theory. We're not talking
[57:21] is a non-drift theory. We're not talking
[57:21] is a non-drift theory. We're not talking about we're not referring to what the
[57:23] about we're not referring to what the
[57:24] about we're not referring to what the linguists are are doing. This is a
[57:26] linguists are are doing. This is a
[57:26] linguists are are doing. This is a different level of understanding of
[57:27] different level of understanding of
[57:27] different level of understanding of language.
[57:31] When I take my arm, my hand and I point
[57:33] When I take my arm, my hand and I point at something,
[57:36] at something,
[57:36] at something, my hand does that pointing because there
[57:39] my hand does that pointing because there
[57:39] my hand does that pointing because there is a map on my motor cortex for my hand
[57:41] is a map on my motor cortex for my hand
[57:41] is a map on my motor cortex for my hand that tells my hand how to point. And
[57:43] that tells my hand how to point. And
[57:43] that tells my hand how to point. And that motor cortex map is not just a
[57:46] that motor cortex map is not just a
[57:46] that motor cortex map is not just a photograph of my hand in some particular
[57:48] photograph of my hand in some particular
[57:48] photograph of my hand in some particular position. It's a dynamic model. It tells
[57:50] position. It's a dynamic model. It tells
[57:50] position. It's a dynamic model. It tells my hand how to move. It's got at least a
[57:53] my hand how to move. It's got at least a
[57:53] my hand how to move. It's got at least a beginning and an end to it. In the
[57:54] beginning and an end to it. In the
[57:54] beginning and an end to it. In the middle, too, probably. And so that
[57:57] middle, too, probably. And so that
[57:57] middle, too, probably. And so that dynamic model can't be just a
[57:59] dynamic model can't be just a
[57:59] dynamic model can't be just a three-dimensional model. It has to have
[58:01] three-dimensional model. It has to have
[58:02] three-dimensional model. It has to have dynamics in it. It has to have change in
[58:03] dynamics in it. It has to have change in
[58:03] dynamics in it. It has to have change in it. That is what a mathematician would
[58:06] it. That is what a mathematician would
[58:06] it. That is what a mathematician would call a hyperdimensional model. It would
[58:08] call a hyperdimensional model. It would
[58:08] call a hyperdimensional model. It would have to have some additional
[58:09] have to have some additional
[58:09] have to have some additional information.
[58:11] information.
[58:11] information. Well, if it's a hyperdimensional
[58:13] Well, if it's a hyperdimensional
[58:13] Well, if it's a hyperdimensional hyperdimensional model, if our
[58:15] hyperdimensional model, if our
[58:16] hyperdimensional model, if our conceptual space on our motor cortex
[58:18] conceptual space on our motor cortex
[58:18] conceptual space on our motor cortex which directs the motion of our hand is
[58:20] which directs the motion of our hand is
[58:20] which directs the motion of our hand is hyperdimensional, say four, five, six or
[58:22] hyperdimensional, say four, five, six or
[58:22] hyperdimensional, say four, five, six or seven dimensions, then this geometry
[58:25] seven dimensions, then this geometry
[58:25] seven dimensions, then this geometry holds. And the natural parts of that
[58:28] holds. And the natural parts of that
[58:28] holds. And the natural parts of that map, no matter how my neurons are wired,
[58:30] map, no matter how my neurons are wired,
[58:30] map, no matter how my neurons are wired, no matter what kind of brain I have, no
[58:32] no matter what kind of brain I have, no
[58:32] no matter what kind of brain I have, no matter what my biology is, if I am
[58:34] matter what my biology is, if I am
[58:34] matter what my biology is, if I am directing this kind of motion, I must be
[58:37] directing this kind of motion, I must be
[58:37] directing this kind of motion, I must be making use of these 27 directions in
[58:40] making use of these 27 directions in
[58:40] making use of these 27 directions in that map. That's the lowest way that I
[58:42] that map. That's the lowest way that I
[58:42] that map. That's the lowest way that I can specify the whole map.
[58:46] can specify the whole map.
[58:46] can specify the whole map. And therefore on my motor cortex there
[58:49] And therefore on my motor cortex there
[58:49] And therefore on my motor cortex there is some kind of a map laid out in these
[58:52] is some kind of a map laid out in these
[58:52] is some kind of a map laid out in these 27 directions. And let's say I want to
[58:55] 27 directions. And let's say I want to
[58:55] 27 directions. And let's say I want to make a sound that corresponds to my
[58:56] make a sound that corresponds to my
[58:56] make a sound that corresponds to my pointing.
[58:58] pointing.
[58:58] pointing. Well, what's the most obvious thing to
[59:00] Well, what's the most obvious thing to
[59:00] Well, what's the most obvious thing to do?
[59:02] do?
[59:02] do? Is that the sound?
[59:04] Is that the sound?
[59:04] Is that the sound? Um, the most obvious thing to do is to
[59:07] Um, the most obvious thing to do is to
[59:07] Um, the most obvious thing to do is to co-opt the same map as I used to move my
[59:11] co-opt the same map as I used to move my
[59:11] co-opt the same map as I used to move my hand and slide it across my motor cortex
[59:14] hand and slide it across my motor cortex
[59:14] hand and slide it across my motor cortex for my hand to a region in my motor
[59:17] for my hand to a region in my motor
[59:17] for my hand to a region in my motor cortex for my hand that it serves
[59:18] cortex for my hand that it serves
[59:18] cortex for my hand that it serves another purpose. Language is controlled
[59:21] another purpose. Language is controlled
[59:21] another purpose. Language is controlled by a sub region of the motor cortex for
[59:23] by a sub region of the motor cortex for
[59:24] by a sub region of the motor cortex for the hand, broker's region. The other
[59:26] the hand, broker's region. The other
[59:26] the hand, broker's region. The other language control regions are there. And
[59:28] language control regions are there. And
[59:28] language control regions are there. And if I try to take the same map and just
[59:30] if I try to take the same map and just
[59:30] if I try to take the same map and just slide it across some some kind of neuron
[59:32] slide it across some some kind of neuron
[59:32] slide it across some some kind of neuron transfer thing and then use the same set
[59:35] transfer thing and then use the same set
[59:35] transfer thing and then use the same set of of map of of coordinations to
[59:39] of of map of of coordinations to
[59:39] of of map of of coordinations to articulate the muscles that make make my
[59:41] articulate the muscles that make make my
[59:41] articulate the muscles that make make my sound rather than move my arm, I'm going
[59:43] sound rather than move my arm, I'm going
[59:43] sound rather than move my arm, I'm going to end up making a sound. But who knows
[59:46] to end up making a sound. But who knows
[59:46] to end up making a sound. But who knows if it's the right sound. I mean, there's
[59:48] if it's the right sound. I mean, there's
[59:48] if it's the right sound. I mean, there's no obvious hardwiring connection. This
[59:51] no obvious hardwiring connection. This
[59:51] no obvious hardwiring connection. This is a conceptual map, but I hear the
[59:54] is a conceptual map, but I hear the
[59:54] is a conceptual map, but I hear the sound I make and that comes back into my
[59:57] sound I make and that comes back into my
[59:57] sound I make and that comes back into my sensory cortex through my ear.
[01:00:00] sensory cortex through my ear.
[01:00:00] sensory cortex through my ear. And I'm saying that the map on my motor
[01:00:03] And I'm saying that the map on my motor
[01:00:03] And I'm saying that the map on my motor cortex that moves my hand and the map on
[01:00:07] cortex that moves my hand and the map on
[01:00:07] cortex that moves my hand and the map on my motor cortex that makes the sound and
[01:00:09] my motor cortex that makes the sound and
[01:00:09] my motor cortex that makes the sound and the map on my sensory cortex that hears
[01:00:11] the map on my sensory cortex that hears
[01:00:11] the map on my sensory cortex that hears the sound are all hyperdimensional maps.
[01:00:15] the sound are all hyperdimensional maps.
[01:00:15] the sound are all hyperdimensional maps. And the feedback loop that connects all
[01:00:17] And the feedback loop that connects all
[01:00:17] And the feedback loop that connects all of this is also a dynamic map. And all
[01:00:21] of this is also a dynamic map. And all
[01:00:21] of this is also a dynamic map. And all of these
[01:00:22] of these
[01:00:22] of these have 27 parts
[01:00:25] have 27 parts
[01:00:25] have 27 parts or the 22p part version. I don't want to
[01:00:27] or the 22p part version. I don't want to
[01:00:27] or the 22p part version. I don't want to get confused with it. In other words,
[01:00:29] get confused with it. In other words,
[01:00:29] get confused with it. In other words, it's it's back to to to to what Crit is
[01:00:31] it's it's back to to to to what Crit is
[01:00:31] it's it's back to to to to what Crit is saying. The unique unity and union are
[01:00:34] saying. The unique unity and union are
[01:00:34] saying. The unique unity and union are one. All three cortex maps have to be
[01:00:38] one. All three cortex maps have to be
[01:00:38] one. All three cortex maps have to be the same for that sound to have meant
[01:00:40] the same for that sound to have meant
[01:00:40] the same for that sound to have meant what that hand did.
[01:00:44] what that hand did.
[01:00:44] what that hand did. And so what I'm saying may be the case
[01:00:47] And so what I'm saying may be the case
[01:00:48] And so what I'm saying may be the case is that these letters, as we're going to
[01:00:50] is that these letters, as we're going to
[01:00:50] is that these letters, as we're going to see, are not initially the letters of
[01:00:52] see, are not initially the letters of
[01:00:52] see, are not initially the letters of ordinary language, as the linguistic
[01:00:55] ordinary language, as the linguistic
[01:00:55] ordinary language, as the linguistic theorist would have you believe. Later
[01:00:57] theorist would have you believe. Later

[01:01:20] logical structure that Coxer and the
[01:01:20] logical structure that Coxer and the group theoretic physicists point out and
[01:01:23] group theoretic physicists point out and
[01:01:23] group theoretic physicists point out and that that's no matter what we really do
[01:01:26] that that's no matter what we really do
[01:01:26] that that's no matter what we really do we can always simplify what we've done
[01:01:27] we can always simplify what we've done
[01:01:27] we can always simplify what we've done to this 27 element system. It covers the
[01:01:30] to this 27 element system. It covers the
[01:01:30] to this 27 element system. It covers the whole gamut.
[01:01:31] whole gamut.
[01:01:32] whole gamut. Now the only way to find out if this
[01:01:34] Now the only way to find out if this
[01:01:34] Now the only way to find out if this makes any sense is to try to use it. And
[01:01:37] makes any sense is to try to use it. And
[01:01:37] makes any sense is to try to use it. And so we're going to try to use it. But
[01:01:40] so we're going to try to use it. But
[01:01:40] so we're going to try to use it. But before we try to use it and go to this
[01:01:42] before we try to use it and go to this
[01:01:42] before we try to use it and go to this matrix of meaning for the letters of the
[01:01:44] matrix of meaning for the letters of the
[01:01:44] matrix of meaning for the letters of the alphabet, we have to somehow recognize
[01:01:48] alphabet, we have to somehow recognize
[01:01:48] alphabet, we have to somehow recognize what this generator for the letter
[01:01:50] what this generator for the letter
[01:01:50] what this generator for the letter shapes has to do with this map on our
[01:01:56] shapes has to do with this map on our
[01:01:56] shapes has to do with this map on our cortex.
[01:01:58] cortex.
[01:01:58] cortex. Well, what is this shape?
[01:02:03] I said at the beginning I was going to
[01:02:04] I said at the beginning I was going to call it naked recursion.
[01:02:08] That's another fancy word for
[01:02:13] a kind of self- embedded reflexive
[01:02:15] a kind of self- embedded reflexive structure
[01:02:17] structure
[01:02:17] structure that basically every module of this

[01:02:22] self-referential process has to partake
[01:02:22] self-referential process has to partake of this. And so what could this thing
[01:02:24] of this. And so what could this thing
[01:02:24] of this. And so what could this thing be?
[01:02:26] be?
[01:02:26] be? Well, if you had a sphere in three
[01:02:28] Well, if you had a sphere in three
[01:02:28] Well, if you had a sphere in three dimensions, it would have three
[01:02:31] dimensions, it would have three
[01:02:31] dimensions, it would have three diameters that would be perpendicular,
[01:02:33] diameters that would be perpendicular,
[01:02:33] diameters that would be perpendicular, right angles to each other, cartisian
[01:02:35] right angles to each other, cartisian
[01:02:35] right angles to each other, cartisian cross.
[01:02:37] cross.
[01:02:37] cross. If you had a sphere in four dimensions,
[01:02:40] If you had a sphere in four dimensions,
[01:02:40] If you had a sphere in four dimensions, there would be an additional diameter
[01:02:41] there would be an additional diameter
[01:02:42] there would be an additional diameter perpendicular to the other three, but we
[01:02:43] perpendicular to the other three, but we
[01:02:43] perpendicular to the other three, but we couldn't see it. It's the one that we
[01:02:45] couldn't see it. It's the one that we
[01:02:46] couldn't see it. It's the one that we correlate with dynamics, with change in
[01:02:47] correlate with dynamics, with change in
[01:02:47] correlate with dynamics, with change in in three dimensions. It's the one that
[01:02:49] in three dimensions. It's the one that
[01:02:49] in three dimensions. It's the one that relates inside to outside in three
[01:02:52] relates inside to outside in three
[01:02:52] relates inside to outside in three space. In fact, going to four
[01:02:54] space. In fact, going to four
[01:02:54] space. In fact, going to four dimensions, you can actually take
[01:02:55] dimensions, you can actually take
[01:02:55] dimensions, you can actually take right-handed things and convert them
[01:02:56] right-handed things and convert them
[01:02:56] right-handed things and convert them into left-handed things by rotating
[01:02:58] into left-handed things by rotating
[01:02:58] into left-handed things by rotating through hyperspace. Theoretically,
[01:03:01] through hyperspace. Theoretically,
[01:03:01] through hyperspace. Theoretically, so it's this inside out direction. This
[01:03:04] so it's this inside out direction. This
[01:03:04] so it's this inside out direction. This is the missing diameter of the
[01:03:06] is the missing diameter of the
[01:03:06] is the missing diameter of the hypersphere projected back into three
[01:03:08] hypersphere projected back into three
[01:03:08] hypersphere projected back into three dimensions. It doesn't have to be a
[01:03:10] dimensions. It doesn't have to be a
[01:03:10] dimensions. It doesn't have to be a hypersphere. What we are calling the
[01:03:12] hypersphere. What we are calling the
[01:03:12] hypersphere. What we are calling the mathematicians are calling a
[01:03:13] mathematicians are calling a
[01:03:13] mathematicians are calling a fourdimensional a three sphere in four
[01:03:15] fourdimensional a three sphere in four
[01:03:15] fourdimensional a three sphere in four space is really nothing but the dynamics
[01:03:17] space is really nothing but the dynamics
[01:03:17] space is really nothing but the dynamics of an ordinary sphere in three
[01:03:19] of an ordinary sphere in three
[01:03:19] of an ordinary sphere in three dimensions. And this form that connects
[01:03:22] dimensions. And this form that connects
[01:03:22] dimensions. And this form that connects the inside to the outside of a fruit, a
[01:03:25] the inside to the outside of a fruit, a
[01:03:25] the inside to the outside of a fruit, a dimpled sphere, an idealized fruit, this
[01:03:27] dimpled sphere, an idealized fruit, this
[01:03:28] dimpled sphere, an idealized fruit, this is that diameter.
[01:03:30] is that diameter.
[01:03:30] is that diameter. And so if I can see all of these
[01:03:34] And so if I can see all of these
[01:03:34] And so if I can see all of these possible orientations, all of these
[01:03:36] possible orientations, all of these
[01:03:36] possible orientations, all of these letters, if they correlate to these 27
[01:03:38] letters, if they correlate to these 27
[01:03:38] letters, if they correlate to these 27 directions, then this alphabet gives me
[01:03:40] directions, then this alphabet gives me
[01:03:40] directions, then this alphabet gives me a way to point in hyperspace or in
[01:03:44] a way to point in hyperspace or in
[01:03:44] a way to point in hyperspace or in conceptual space to all the
[01:03:45] conceptual space to all the

[01:03:48] possibilities. Well, I just said it to
[01:03:48] possibilities. Well, I just said it to point. You see this is a hand.
[01:03:52] point. You see this is a hand.

[01:05:36] Well, obviously, if you fell off a camel
[01:05:36] Well, obviously, if you fell off a camel and hit yourself in the head, it's not
[01:05:37] and hit yourself in the head, it's not

[01:05:40] experiment. It's not really very
[01:05:40] experiment. It's not really very reproducible. But if you had a
[01:05:44] reproducible. But if you had a
[01:05:44] reproducible. But if you had a means of reexperiencing this, a
[01:05:47] means of reexperiencing this, a
[01:05:47] means of reexperiencing this, a meditation, a sequence of exercises,

[01:05:59] means, different people use different. And if you could somehow specify the
[01:06:02] And if you could somehow specify the
[01:06:02] And if you could somehow specify the experience so someone else could retrace
[01:06:05] experience so someone else could retrace
[01:06:05] experience so someone else could retrace your path, then they would have the same
[01:06:08] your path, then they would have the same
[01:06:08] your path, then they would have the same experience.
[01:06:11] experience.
[01:06:11] experience. And so if somehow there were a means of
[01:06:13] And so if somehow there were a means of
[01:06:13] And so if somehow there were a means of specifying a meditation
[01:06:17] internally,
[01:06:19] internally, that would be a much better way of
[01:06:21] that would be a much better way of
[01:06:21] that would be a much better way of reproducing the experience than simply
[01:06:23] reproducing the experience than simply
[01:06:23] reproducing the experience than simply writing down I had this wonderful peak
[01:06:24] writing down I had this wonderful peak
[01:06:24] writing down I had this wonderful peak experience which I can't describe
[01:06:27] experience which I can't describe

[01:06:31] retrace your path exactly would have

[01:06:35] experience. And so we want an alphabet that's going
[01:06:37] And so we want an alphabet that's going
[01:06:37] And so we want an alphabet that's going to work inside too. Not only does it
[01:06:40] to work inside too. Not only does it
[01:06:40] to work inside too. Not only does it tell us what direction to point in the
[01:06:42] tell us what direction to point in the
[01:06:42] tell us what direction to point in the world,
[01:06:44] world,
[01:06:44] world, but it also has to be visualizable
[01:06:48] but it also has to be visualizable
[01:06:48] but it also has to be visualizable in our mind's eye.
[01:06:51] in our mind's eye.
[01:06:51] in our mind's eye. Now that's what makes this so beautiful.
[01:06:53] Now that's what makes this so beautiful.
[01:06:54] Now that's what makes this so beautiful. There are two teachings about the source
[01:06:55] There are two teachings about the source
[01:06:55] There are two teachings about the source of the alphabet. One of them is that the
[01:06:57] of the alphabet. One of them is that the
[01:06:58] of the alphabet. One of them is that the letters come from fire or flame. in the
[01:07:00] letters come from fire or flame. in the
[01:07:00] letters come from fire or flame. in the other in Hebrew is that these letter
[01:07:03] other in Hebrew is that these letter
[01:07:03] other in Hebrew is that these letter shapes and these are the formal shapes
[01:07:05] shapes and these are the formal shapes
[01:07:06] shapes and these are the formal shapes all of them are made up of the letter
[01:07:07] all of them are made up of the letter
[01:07:07] all of them are made up of the letter yud this small little letter they're all
[01:07:10] yud this small little letter they're all
[01:07:10] yud this small little letter they're all composed of little pieces of yud
[01:07:13] composed of little pieces of yud
[01:07:13] composed of little pieces of yud that's a nice teaching
[01:07:15] that's a nice teaching
[01:07:15] that's a nice teaching and it's obviously true in terms of
[01:07:17] and it's obviously true in terms of
[01:07:18] and it's obviously true in terms of calligraphy but yud also means hand
[01:07:25] and the one thing that every human being
[01:07:30] and the one thing that every human being can automatically do, it's a survival
[01:07:33] can automatically do, it's a survival
[01:07:33] can automatically do, it's a survival necessity, is visualize their own hand.
[01:07:38] necessity, is visualize their own hand.
[01:07:38] necessity, is visualize their own hand. You close your eyes,
[01:07:40] You close your eyes,
[01:07:40] You close your eyes, try it. Close your eyes and point
[01:07:42] try it. Close your eyes and point
[01:07:42] try it. Close your eyes and point towards the ceiling. Hold your hand any
[01:07:43] towards the ceiling. Hold your hand any
[01:07:43] towards the ceiling. Hold your hand any way you want. You will be able to see in
[01:07:46] way you want. You will be able to see in
[01:07:46] way you want. You will be able to see in your imagination, in your mind's eye,
[01:07:48] your imagination, in your mind's eye,
[01:07:48] your imagination, in your mind's eye, where your hand is, where your fingers
[01:07:49] where your hand is, where your fingers
[01:07:49] where your hand is, where your fingers are, where your palm is.
[01:07:53] are, where your palm is.
[01:07:53] are, where your palm is. And so if you put the hand in your hand,
[01:07:57] And so if you put the hand in your hand,
[01:07:57] And so if you put the hand in your hand, you can feel it against your skin,
[01:08:00] you can feel it against your skin,
[01:08:00] you can feel it against your skin, you can immediately visualize
[01:08:03] you can immediately visualize
[01:08:03] you can immediately visualize the letters.
[01:08:06] What is more natural as a source of an
[01:08:10] What is more natural as a source of an alphabet
[01:08:12] alphabet
[01:08:12] alphabet than to take from the hand the letters
[01:08:15] than to take from the hand the letters
[01:08:15] than to take from the hand the letters in the same way as the speech is taken
[01:08:17] in the same way as the speech is taken
[01:08:17] in the same way as the speech is taken from the motor cortex for the hand in
[01:08:19] from the motor cortex for the hand in
[01:08:19] from the motor cortex for the hand in the brain.
[01:08:22] the brain.
[01:08:22] the brain. And how was it forgotten that the
[01:08:23] And how was it forgotten that the
[01:08:23] And how was it forgotten that the letters came from a hand? They wrote it
[01:08:25] letters came from a hand? They wrote it
[01:08:25] letters came from a hand? They wrote it down. It says it comes from yud. Except
[01:08:27] down. It says it comes from yud. Except
[01:08:27] down. It says it comes from yud. Except people thought it meant small yud
[01:08:29] people thought it meant small yud
[01:08:29] people thought it meant small yud instead of the hand. So now we have the
[01:08:32] instead of the hand. So now we have the
[01:08:32] instead of the hand. So now we have the ex the physical
[01:08:35] ex the physical
[01:08:35] ex the physical metaphor, the physical expression of
[01:08:37] metaphor, the physical expression of
[01:08:37] metaphor, the physical expression of outside of our inside being used for the
[01:08:41] outside of our inside being used for the
[01:08:41] outside of our inside being used for the purpose of connecting outside and inside
[01:08:43] purpose of connecting outside and inside
[01:08:43] purpose of connecting outside and inside and outside.
[01:08:47] And this is the first important finding
[01:08:49] And this is the first important finding is that what we're really looking at
[01:08:51] is that what we're really looking at
[01:08:51] is that what we're really looking at here, what's really going on is that
[01:08:54] here, what's really going on is that
[01:08:54] here, what's really going on is that this naked recursion, this self-
[01:08:55] this naked recursion, this self-
[01:08:55] this naked recursion, this self- embedment is our hand. This is how we
[01:08:59] embedment is our hand. This is how we
[01:08:59] embedment is our hand. This is how we express our inside in the outside world.
[01:09:01] express our inside in the outside world.
[01:09:01] express our inside in the outside world. This is our way of embedding ourselves
[01:09:03] This is our way of embedding ourselves
[01:09:03] This is our way of embedding ourselves in reality is our hand. All right.
[01:09:07] in reality is our hand. All right.
[01:09:07] in reality is our hand. All right. Now I think I want to go directly
[01:09:10] Now I think I want to go directly
[01:09:10] Now I think I want to go directly towards the most difficult and
[01:09:12] towards the most difficult and
[01:09:12] towards the most difficult and controversial part now of this
[01:09:15] controversial part now of this
[01:09:15] controversial part now of this presentation and we'll come back with

[01:09:18] questions and comments to some of these other ideas and I think there'll
[01:09:19] other ideas and I think there'll
[01:09:19] other ideas and I think there'll probably be lots of questions because
[01:09:21] probably be lots of questions because
[01:09:21] probably be lots of questions because what I want to do now is present
[01:09:23] what I want to do now is present
[01:09:23] what I want to do now is present something that's unbelievable. It's not

[01:10:11] don't know why it works.
[01:10:11] don't know why it works. So it does seem to work but I think this
[01:10:14] So it does seem to work but I think this
[01:10:14] So it does seem to work but I think this is the underlying reason why it works.
[01:10:16] is the underlying reason why it works.
[01:10:16] is the underlying reason why it works. And what I want to do is I want to go
[01:10:17] And what I want to do is I want to go
[01:10:17] And what I want to do is I want to go through the alphabet letter by letter.
[01:10:18] through the alphabet letter by letter.
[01:10:18] through the alphabet letter by letter. Now most of you should have alphabet
[01:10:20] Now most of you should have alphabet
[01:10:20] Now most of you should have alphabet charts. And what I want to do is use
[01:10:22] charts. And what I want to do is use
[01:10:22] charts. And what I want to do is use these basically these these charts and
[01:10:25] these basically these these charts and
[01:10:25] these basically these these charts and this chart here. And I think rather than
[01:10:29] this chart here. And I think rather than

[01:10:30] my continuing to give you all this
[01:10:30] my continuing to give you all this theory, I should put these definitions
[01:10:33] theory, I should put these definitions
[01:10:33] theory, I should put these definitions of the letters on the table and let you
[01:10:35] of the letters on the table and let you
[01:10:35] of the letters on the table and let you take them home and try to use them.
[01:10:39] take them home and try to use them.
[01:10:39] take them home and try to use them. So let's see if we can do it. Here is
[01:10:42] So let's see if we can do it. Here is
[01:10:42] So let's see if we can do it. Here is fundamental process, fundamental
[01:10:44] fundamental process, fundamental
[01:10:44] fundamental process, fundamental self-organization.
[01:10:48] And I'm saying that this sevenst step
[01:10:50] And I'm saying that this sevenst step process
[01:10:52] process
[01:10:52] process is the tree
[01:10:55] is the tree
[01:10:55] is the tree and that it connects between unity and
[01:10:57] and that it connects between unity and
[01:10:57] and that it connects between unity and wholeness, between the seed and the
[01:10:59] wholeness, between the seed and the
[01:11:00] wholeness, between the seed and the fruit with new seed inside between a
[01:11:03] fruit with new seed inside between a
[01:11:03] fruit with new seed inside between a point sphere and a sphere point. And it
[01:11:06] point sphere and a sphere point. And it
[01:11:06] point sphere and a sphere point. And it does it in just under four dimensional
[01:11:08] does it in just under four dimensional
[01:11:08] does it in just under four dimensional steps. Never quite makes it to four
[01:11:10] steps. Never quite makes it to four
[01:11:10] steps. Never quite makes it to four dimension because as soon as you get up
[01:11:11] dimension because as soon as you get up
[01:11:12] dimension because as soon as you get up to homelessness, it's got a new seed
[01:11:13] to homelessness, it's got a new seed
[01:11:13] to homelessness, it's got a new seed inside and the old fruit is eaten up by
[01:11:15] inside and the old fruit is eaten up by
[01:11:15] inside and the old fruit is eaten up by the chicken. I've mixed a few metaphors
[01:11:18] the chicken. I've mixed a few metaphors
[01:11:18] the chicken. I've mixed a few metaphors there, but you know what I mean. The
[01:11:19] there, but you know what I mean. The
[01:11:19] there, but you know what I mean. The chick finishes all the white before it
[01:11:21] chick finishes all the white before it
[01:11:21] chick finishes all the white before it cracks the shell.
[01:11:25] cracks the shell.
[01:11:25] cracks the shell. All right, let's let's lay out the logic
[01:11:27] All right, let's let's lay out the logic
[01:11:27] All right, let's let's lay out the logic and then let's let's apply it.
[01:11:30] and then let's let's apply it.
[01:11:30] and then let's let's apply it. First, we're going to start with unity
[01:11:32] First, we're going to start with unity
[01:11:32] First, we're going to start with unity and we're going to end up with
[01:11:33] and we're going to end up with
[01:11:33] and we're going to end up with wholeness. And we're going to do that in
[01:11:36] wholeness. And we're going to do that in
[01:11:36] wholeness. And we're going to do that in three levels of the algorithm.
[01:11:39] three levels of the algorithm.
[01:11:39] three levels of the algorithm. And the first step beyond unity is the
[01:11:42] And the first step beyond unity is the
[01:11:42] And the first step beyond unity is the first distinction. The first distinction
[01:11:45] first distinction. The first distinction
[01:11:45] first distinction. The first distinction in what? The first distinction par

[01:12:12] the first distinction is between inside and outside.
[01:12:15] and outside.
[01:12:15] and outside. breaking open and then then there's
[01:12:18] breaking open and then then there's
[01:12:18] breaking open and then then there's action then there's a relationship
[01:12:20] action then there's a relationship
[01:12:20] action then there's a relationship between the two parts between inside and
[01:12:22] between the two parts between inside and
[01:12:22] between the two parts between inside and outside
[01:12:24] outside
[01:12:24] outside then there's continued opening which I'm
[01:12:26] then there's continued opening which I'm
[01:12:26] then there's continued opening which I'm calling division here then there's
[01:12:28] calling division here then there's
[01:12:28] calling division here then there's action together which is equivalent to
[01:12:31] action together which is equivalent to
[01:12:31] action together which is equivalent to the turn then there's multiplication
[01:12:33] the turn then there's multiplication
[01:12:33] the turn then there's multiplication which is the opposite of division in the
[01:12:35] which is the opposite of division in the
[01:12:35] which is the opposite of division in the same sense as Arthur says takes on its
[01:12:37] same sense as Arthur says takes on its
[01:12:37] same sense as Arthur says takes on its own center and throws off centers here
[01:12:38] own center and throws off centers here
[01:12:38] own center and throws off centers here it takes on a center by repeated
[01:12:40] it takes on a center by repeated
[01:12:40] it takes on a center by repeated division this subtractus form here it
[01:12:42] division this subtractus form here it
[01:12:42] division this subtractus form here it throws off centers by multiplication and
[01:12:44] throws off centers by multiplication and
[01:12:44] throws off centers by multiplication and the golden mean unfilman.
[01:12:47] the golden mean unfilman.
[01:12:47] the golden mean unfilman. And again this is another kind of if
[01:12:49] And again this is another kind of if
[01:12:49] And again this is another kind of if this is internalized action if this is
[01:12:51] this is internalized action if this is
[01:12:51] this is internalized action if this is action together then this must be
[01:12:53] action together then this must be
[01:12:53] action together then this must be externalized action projection. And then
[01:12:56] externalized action projection. And then
[01:12:56] externalized action projection. And then if this is opening this must be closure.
[01:13:00] if this is opening this must be closure.
[01:13:00] if this is opening this must be closure. Now we're going to apply and then after
[01:13:02] Now we're going to apply and then after
[01:13:02] Now we're going to apply and then after closure we we come back to wholeness.
[01:13:05] closure we we come back to wholeness.
[01:13:05] closure we we come back to wholeness. The fruit encloses itself. The egg shell
[01:13:08] The fruit encloses itself. The egg shell
[01:13:08] The fruit encloses itself. The egg shell is finished and now we have wholeness.
[01:13:10] is finished and now we have wholeness.
[01:13:10] is finished and now we have wholeness. Now, we're going to apply these
[01:13:12] Now, we're going to apply these
[01:13:12] Now, we're going to apply these principles to three levels of the
[01:13:13] principles to three levels of the
[01:13:13] principles to three levels of the alphabet, and we're going to examine how
[01:13:17] alphabet, and we're going to examine how
[01:13:17] alphabet, and we're going to examine how the meaning of the Hebrew letter
[01:13:19] the meaning of the Hebrew letter
[01:13:19] the meaning of the Hebrew letter corresponds to this chart.
[01:13:22] corresponds to this chart.
[01:13:22] corresponds to this chart. Now,
[01:13:24] Now,
[01:13:24] Now, I don't think people can read this
[01:13:25] I don't think people can read this
[01:13:25] I don't think people can read this unless they've got in front of them, but
[01:13:27] unless they've got in front of them, but
[01:13:27] unless they've got in front of them, but I I will go through it.
[01:13:30] I I will go through it.
[01:13:30] I I will go through it. Every Hebrew letter has a name,
[01:13:35] Every Hebrew letter has a name,
[01:13:35] Every Hebrew letter has a name, and those names have meaning.
[01:13:38] and those names have meaning.
[01:13:38] and those names have meaning. And many of the Hebrew letters have
[01:13:39] And many of the Hebrew letters have
[01:13:40] And many of the Hebrew letters have known explicit meaning as either
[01:13:41] known explicit meaning as either
[01:13:41] known explicit meaning as either prefixes or suffixes which
[01:13:44] prefixes or suffixes which
[01:13:44] prefixes or suffixes which complement the meaning of the name. And
[01:13:47] complement the meaning of the name. And
[01:13:47] complement the meaning of the name. And so every Hebrew letter comes with a
[01:13:49] so every Hebrew letter comes with a
[01:13:49] so every Hebrew letter comes with a whole story.
[01:13:51] whole story.
[01:13:51] whole story. What we're going to find is that for
[01:13:53] What we're going to find is that for
[01:13:53] What we're going to find is that for every Hebrew letter name, there is an
[01:13:54] every Hebrew letter name, there is an
[01:13:54] every Hebrew letter name, there is an equivalent English word that has the
[01:13:56] equivalent English word that has the
[01:13:56] equivalent English word that has the same meaning.
[01:13:57] same meaning.
[01:13:58] same meaning. It's going to be surprising enough. And
[01:13:59] It's going to be surprising enough. And
[01:13:59] It's going to be surprising enough. And then we're going to find that any word
[01:14:01] then we're going to find that any word
[01:14:01] then we're going to find that any word in any language that we can
[01:14:02] in any language that we can

[01:29:09] piish function except P is to engulf to
[01:29:09] piish function except P is to engulf to swallow to bring in. So it's a volume
[01:29:11] swallow to bring in. So it's a volume
[01:29:12] swallow to bring in. So it's a volume taken inward and the final P same
[01:29:16] taken inward and the final P same
[01:29:16] taken inward and the final P same meaning is the volume pushed outward to
[01:29:18] meaning is the volume pushed outward to
[01:29:18] meaning is the volume pushed outward to puff outward.
[01:29:20] puff outward.
[01:29:20] puff outward. And if we take them together, I didn't

[01:29:22] And if we take them together, I didn't do the three together for the G O and N.
[01:29:24] do the three together for the G O and N.
[01:29:24] do the three together for the G O and N. Well, G O and N mean to go on, which is
[01:29:27] Well, G O and N mean to go on, which is
[01:29:27] Well, G O and N mean to go on, which is just what this projective idea is.
[01:29:30] just what this projective idea is.
[01:29:30] just what this projective idea is. This is H and whatever the bowel might
[01:29:33] This is H and whatever the bowel might
[01:29:33] This is H and whatever the bowel might be and a couple of P's. Well, that's a
[01:29:34] be and a couple of P's. Well, that's a
[01:29:34] be and a couple of P's. Well, that's a hoop,
[01:29:36] hoop,
[01:29:36] hoop, which is this surrounding idea. This
[01:29:38] which is this surrounding idea. This
[01:29:38] which is this surrounding idea. This pish idea.
[01:29:41] pish idea.
[01:29:41] pish idea. Now, finally, if this was unity, then
[01:29:43] Now, finally, if this was unity, then
[01:29:43] Now, finally, if this was unity, then this is going to be homelessness. So the
[01:29:45] this is going to be homelessness. So the

[01:30:11] suckled the child will survive if it's
[01:30:11] suckled the child will survive if it's not suckled but it's not complete And so
[01:30:15] not suckled but it's not complete And so
[01:30:15] not suckled but it's not complete And so Tet means completion.
[01:30:17] Tet means completion.
[01:30:17] Tet means completion. Jet, tithe, total are the same words in

[01:30:31] spiritual completeness. Well, the word
[01:30:31] spiritual completeness. Well, the word sadi in Hebrew means a righteous person.
[01:30:33] sadi in Hebrew means a righteous person.
[01:30:33] sadi in Hebrew means a righteous person. That's sad. It corresponds to our sort
[01:30:36] That's sad. It corresponds to our sort
[01:30:36] That's sad. It corresponds to our sort of English word zodiac.

[01:33:53] it's spelled AFT,
[01:33:53] it's spelled AFT, pronounced ought.
[01:33:55] pronounced ought.
[01:33:56] pronounced ought. Look what it says. I'm saying the
[01:33:58] Look what it says. I'm saying the
[01:33:58] Look what it says. I'm saying the letters come from this form of naked
[01:34:00] letters come from this form of naked

[01:34:03] recursion.
[01:34:03] recursion. Allah
[01:34:06] Allah
[01:34:06] Allah is all consciousness.
[01:34:08] is all consciousness.
[01:34:08] is all consciousness. [Applause]
[01:34:09] [Applause]
[01:34:09] [Applause] V
[01:34:12] V
[01:34:12] V is the idea of doing or unfurling or
[01:34:15] is the idea of doing or unfurling or
[01:34:15] is the idea of doing or unfurling or vibrating.
[01:34:17] vibrating.

[01:34:28] unfurling itself in its own likeness.
[01:34:28] unfurling itself in its own likeness. I'd say that's about the same meaning as
[01:34:30] I'd say that's about the same meaning as
[01:34:30] I'd say that's about the same meaning as naked recursion.
[01:34:34] The transformation between the forms
[01:34:36] The transformation between the forms which I didn't get to before which is
[01:34:38] which I didn't get to before which is

[01:34:41] talk about some of these other figures
[01:34:41] talk about some of these other figures either. The this figure called the
[01:34:43] either. The this figure called the
[01:34:43] either. The this figure called the schmoply double six represents some of
[01:34:46] schmoply double six represents some of
[01:34:46] schmoply double six represents some of these 27 lines projected back into three
[01:34:48] these 27 lines projected back into three
[01:34:48] these 27 lines projected back into three dimensions. We have 12 of them. As you
[01:34:51] dimensions. We have 12 of them. As you
[01:34:51] dimensions. We have 12 of them. As you can see, it has this unique pattern to
[01:34:53] can see, it has this unique pattern to
[01:34:53] can see, it has this unique pattern to it, which is very much like the Tardine
[01:34:55] it, which is very much like the Tardine
[01:34:55] it, which is very much like the Tardine pattern that I was talking about earlier
[01:34:56] pattern that I was talking about earlier
[01:34:56] pattern that I was talking about earlier that corresponds to to the the little
[01:34:59] that corresponds to to the the little
[01:34:59] that corresponds to to the the little decorations that are on the letters.
[01:35:01] decorations that are on the letters.
[01:35:01] decorations that are on the letters. Some of the letters have these
[01:35:02] Some of the letters have these
[01:35:02] Some of the letters have these decorations on them, and those turn out
[01:35:04] decorations on them, and those turn out
[01:35:04] decorations on them, and those turn out to be these corner pieces. This same
[01:35:06] to be these corner pieces. This same
[01:35:06] to be these corner pieces. This same form turns out to sit, as Fuller shows,
[01:35:10] form turns out to sit, as Fuller shows,
[01:35:10] form turns out to sit, as Fuller shows, around an icosahedral ball in an
[01:35:12] around an icosahedral ball in an
[01:35:12] around an icosahedral ball in an ubahedral shell. And so we can make this
[01:35:15] ubahedral shell. And so we can make this
[01:35:15] ubahedral shell. And so we can make this 27 line form
[01:35:18] 27 line form
[01:35:18] 27 line form using the cube octahedron.
[01:35:21] using the cube octahedron.
[01:35:21] using the cube octahedron. This is actually only 12 of the of the
[01:35:23] This is actually only 12 of the of the
[01:35:23] This is actually only 12 of the of the schloffly double six form. And this has
[01:35:25] schloffly double six form. And this has
[01:35:25] schloffly double six form. And this has some interesting properties. You see
[01:35:27] some interesting properties. You see
[01:35:27] some interesting properties. You see these skew lines ought to be the
[01:35:29] these skew lines ought to be the
[01:35:29] these skew lines ought to be the sighting directions for the letters
[01:35:31] sighting directions for the letters
[01:35:31] sighting directions for the letters physically.

[01:36:04] though it's not obvious, this form is the same as this form. There it is flat.
[01:36:08] the same as this form. There it is flat.
[01:36:08] the same as this form. There it is flat. In fact, you can see it. Here's another
[01:36:10] In fact, you can see it. Here's another
[01:36:10] In fact, you can see it. Here's another version. These are topologically
[01:36:11] version. These are topologically
[01:36:11] version. These are topologically identical, all of these. And so these
[01:36:15] identical, all of these. And so these
[01:36:15] identical, all of these. And so these distinctions in not theory form the same
[01:36:19] distinctions in not theory form the same
[01:36:19] distinctions in not theory form the same structure. But here we have the 22
[01:36:22] structure. But here we have the 22
[01:36:22] structure. But here we have the 22 letters
[01:36:25] letters
[01:36:25] letters forming the core. If I can get it up in
[01:36:27] forming the core. If I can get it up in
[01:36:27] forming the core. If I can get it up in there.
[01:36:29] there.
[01:36:29] there. [Applause]
[01:36:31] [Applause]
[01:36:31] [Applause] And then if we would extend the letters
[01:36:33] And then if we would extend the letters
[01:36:33] And then if we would extend the letters that become finals out onto the rim
[01:36:35] that become finals out onto the rim
[01:36:35] that become finals out onto the rim above and below then we have the 27
[01:36:38] above and below then we have the 27
[01:36:38] above and below then we have the 27 letter form. You see the 27 is on the
[01:36:41] letter form. You see the 27 is on the
[01:36:41] letter form. You see the 27 is on the spherical form and the 22 is on the
[01:36:44] spherical form and the 22 is on the
[01:36:44] spherical form and the 22 is on the linear form. This is like the
[01:36:46] linear form. This is like the
[01:36:46] linear form. This is like the relationship in super string space and
[01:36:48] relationship in super string space and
[01:36:48] relationship in super string space and this is like the event. The 20 the 27 is
[01:36:51] this is like the event. The 20 the 27 is
[01:36:51] this is like the event. The 20 the 27 is like the event. So there's a direct
[01:36:54] like the event. So there's a direct
[01:36:54] like the event. So there's a direct transform on all of these knots. In
[01:36:56] transform on all of these knots. In
[01:36:56] transform on all of these knots. In fact, let me show it to you. This is the
[01:36:57] fact, let me show it to you. This is the
[01:36:57] fact, let me show it to you. This is the 34 knot.
[01:37:00] 34 knot.
[01:37:00] 34 knot. All I have to do to make it into the
[01:37:02] All I have to do to make it into the
[01:37:02] All I have to do to make it into the trifolium is to pull it out.
[01:37:05] trifolium is to pull it out.
[01:37:05] trifolium is to pull it out. And there is my tfoil form which is up
[01:37:07] And there is my tfoil form which is up
[01:37:07] And there is my tfoil form which is up on the walls and has a tetrahelix in the
[01:37:09] on the walls and has a tetrahelix in the
[01:37:10] on the walls and has a tetrahelix in the middle of it. It's just a just couple.
[01:37:12] middle of it. It's just a just couple.
[01:37:12] middle of it. It's just a just couple. It's just topology. It does it to
[01:37:14] It's just topology. It does it to
[01:37:14] It's just topology. It does it to itself. There's there's no need to do
[01:37:15] itself. There's there's no need to do
[01:37:16] itself. There's there's no need to do anything. Um,
[01:37:20] by the way, you cannot make a
[01:37:21] by the way, you cannot make a tetrahedrin out of it. It is not
[01:37:23] tetrahedrin out of it. It is not
[01:37:23] tetrahedrin out of it. It is not symmetrical. It has to be a double
[01:37:25] symmetrical. It has to be a double
[01:37:25] symmetrical. It has to be a double figure to do that which explains some of
[01:37:28] figure to do that which explains some of
[01:37:28] figure to do that which explains some of it. And I want to fit this in too. There
[01:37:31] it. And I want to fit this in too. There
[01:37:31] it. And I want to fit this in too. There is a motion that unfurls all of these.
[01:37:33] is a motion that unfurls all of these.
[01:37:33] is a motion that unfurls all of these. If one moves according to these orbits,
[01:37:35] If one moves according to these orbits,
[01:37:35] If one moves according to these orbits, then one produces the form. If you have
[01:37:38] then one produces the form. If you have
[01:37:38] then one produces the form. If you have a central point,
[01:37:40] a central point,
[01:37:40] a central point, okay? And you do this. The point
[01:37:45] okay? And you do this. The point
[01:37:45] okay? And you do this. The point explodes in three directions and pulls
[01:37:47] explodes in three directions and pulls
[01:37:47] explodes in three directions and pulls apart and twists simultaneously. comes
[01:37:49] apart and twists simultaneously. comes
[01:37:50] apart and twists simultaneously. comes up like this taichi achiloype motion.
[01:37:53] up like this taichi achiloype motion.
[01:37:53] up like this taichi achiloype motion. Here's what you get.
[01:37:56] Here's what you get.
[01:37:56] Here's what you get. These edges
[01:37:58] These edges
[01:37:58] These edges coming up out of this tetrahedral shell
[01:38:00] coming up out of this tetrahedral shell
[01:38:00] coming up out of this tetrahedral shell out of this iicosahedrin in the middle
[01:38:02] out of this iicosahedrin in the middle
[01:38:02] out of this iicosahedrin in the middle because that's what's in the middle.
[01:38:03] because that's what's in the middle.
[01:38:04] because that's what's in the middle. This is the three intersection. See the
[01:38:06] This is the three intersection. See the
[01:38:06] This is the three intersection. See the center? These three edges turn out to be
[01:38:10] center? These three edges turn out to be
[01:38:10] center? These three edges turn out to be if you start with a hyperteted in the
[01:38:12] if you start with a hyperteted in the
[01:38:12] if you start with a hyperteted in the middle
[01:38:15] middle
[01:38:15] middle the same as these rubber bands and it
[01:38:17] the same as these rubber bands and it
[01:38:17] the same as these rubber bands and it comes right up into 27 line figure.
[01:38:23] Okay. Now I think that it is a good idea
[01:38:27] Okay. Now I think that it is a good idea to take a break. There are a lot of
[01:38:29] to take a break. There are a lot of
[01:38:29] to take a break. There are a lot of questions that people can ask and I
[01:38:30] questions that people can ask and I
[01:38:30] questions that people can ask and I really haven't covered um all the
[01:38:32] really haven't covered um all the
[01:38:32] really haven't covered um all the details. What I wanted to do was get the
[01:38:34] details. What I wanted to do was get the
[01:38:34] details. What I wanted to do was get the matrix of meaning for the alphabet out.
[01:38:37] matrix of meaning for the alphabet out.
[01:38:37] matrix of meaning for the alphabet out. There is one more thing that I want to
[01:38:39] There is one more thing that I want to
[01:38:39] There is one more thing that I want to share with you and that is how does one
[01:38:41] share with you and that is how does one
[01:38:41] share with you and that is how does one connect these letter shapes with the 27
[01:38:43] connect these letter shapes with the 27
[01:38:43] connect these letter shapes with the 27 directions but we'll leave that for
[01:38:44] directions but we'll leave that for
[01:38:44] directions but we'll leave that for after the stretch. Also for after the
[01:38:47] after the stretch. Also for after the
[01:38:47] after the stretch. Also for after the stretch I want to deal with questions
[01:38:50] stretch I want to deal with questions
[01:38:50] stretch I want to deal with questions and with word examples. Now I've got a
[01:38:53] and with word examples. Now I've got a
[01:38:53] and with word examples. Now I've got a whole bunch of examples that I brought
[01:38:54] whole bunch of examples that I brought
[01:38:54] whole bunch of examples that I brought plus you can throw some at me. I don't
[01:38:55] plus you can throw some at me. I don't
[01:38:55] plus you can throw some at me. I don't know how well I'll do. It only works
[01:38:57] know how well I'll do. It only works
[01:38:57] know how well I'll do. It only works about 80% of the time because there's
[01:38:58] about 80% of the time because there's
[01:38:58] about 80% of the time because there's lots of reasons why this is an imprecise
[01:39:01] lots of reasons why this is an imprecise
[01:39:01] lots of reasons why this is an imprecise art. But I think we should discuss some
[01:39:03] art. But I think we should discuss some
[01:39:03] art. But I think we should discuss some of the implications of this. So stretch
[01:39:05] of the implications of this. So stretch
[01:39:05] of the implications of this. So stretch time.
[01:39:08] time.
[01:39:08] time. [Applause]
[01:39:10] [Applause]
[01:39:10] [Applause] Traditionally, of course, this nice
[01:39:12] Traditionally, of course, this nice
[01:39:12] Traditionally, of course, this nice shape is the same shape as the ram's
[01:39:14] shape is the same shape as the ram's
[01:39:14] shape is the same shape as the ram's horn,
[01:39:15] horn,
[01:39:15] horn, um, which is said to have been created
[01:39:17] um, which is said to have been created
[01:39:17] um, which is said to have been created during the creation of the universe. And
[01:39:20] during the creation of the universe. And
[01:39:20] during the creation of the universe. And so when people say, well, how come your
[01:39:22] so when people say, well, how come your
[01:39:22] so when people say, well, how come your letters look like these rabbitic hands
[01:39:24] letters look like these rabbitic hands
[01:39:24] letters look like these rabbitic hands that these rabbis have your model on the
[01:39:26] that these rabbis have your model on the
[01:39:26] that these rabbis have your model on the table? No, they didn't have my model on
[01:39:28] table? No, they didn't have my model on
[01:39:28] table? No, they didn't have my model on the table. They had our choker on the
[01:39:30] the table. They had our choker on the
[01:39:30] the table. They had our choker on the table. So they could easily have made a
[01:39:32] table. So they could easily have made a
[01:39:32] table. So they could easily have made a letter.
[01:39:33] letter.
[01:39:33] letter. There's um people wanted to see what the
[01:39:37] There's um people wanted to see what the
[01:39:37] There's um people wanted to see what the letters really look like. So let me tell
[01:39:39] letters really look like. So let me tell
[01:39:39] letters really look like. So let me tell you that you can see the letters on
[01:39:40] you that you can see the letters on
[01:39:40] you that you can see the letters on either hand. For instance, from my point
[01:39:43] either hand. For instance, from my point
[01:39:43] either hand. For instance, from my point of view now, I can see two letter M's in
[01:39:45] of view now, I can see two letter M's in
[01:39:45] of view now, I can see two letter M's in Hebrew. Both of these are M's. And guess
[01:39:48] Hebrew. Both of these are M's. And guess
[01:39:48] Hebrew. Both of these are M's. And guess what? What if we were to draw a line
[01:39:50] what? What if we were to draw a line
[01:39:50] what? What if we were to draw a line between these two M's? We would have a
[01:39:52] between these two M's? We would have a
[01:39:52] between these two M's? We would have a direction. And there of course be 27 of
[01:39:55] direction. And there of course be 27 of
[01:39:55] direction. And there of course be 27 of them. So it may be very easy to make the
[01:39:57] them. So it may be very easy to make the
[01:39:57] them. So it may be very easy to make the 27 correlation simply by lighting up the
[01:40:01] 27 correlation simply by lighting up the
[01:40:01] 27 correlation simply by lighting up the two ends of the line. Here are two ends.
[01:40:04] two ends of the line. Here are two ends.
[01:40:04] two ends of the line. Here are two ends. Um also another thing that's interesting
[01:40:06] Um also another thing that's interesting
[01:40:06] Um also another thing that's interesting you've all heard about the code which is
[01:40:08] you've all heard about the code which is
[01:40:08] you've all heard about the code which is a front back reflection code that was
[01:40:10] a front back reflection code that was
[01:40:10] a front back reflection code that was used in the cobalistic tradition. A is T
[01:40:13] used in the cobalistic tradition. A is T
[01:40:13] used in the cobalistic tradition. A is T and B is S and C is R. Well, that's how
[01:40:17] and B is S and C is R. Well, that's how
[01:40:17] and B is S and C is R. Well, that's how the letters pair up. You see when I hold
[01:40:20] the letters pair up. You see when I hold
[01:40:20] the letters pair up. You see when I hold the letters like this in my left hand I
[01:40:23] the letters like this in my left hand I
[01:40:23] the letters like this in my left hand I see the letter A. And in my right hand I
[01:40:25] see the letter A. And in my right hand I
[01:40:25] see the letter A. And in my right hand I see the letter T. If I hold my hands
[01:40:28] see the letter T. If I hold my hands
[01:40:28] see the letter T. If I hold my hands like this, in my left hand I see the
[01:40:30] like this, in my left hand I see the
[01:40:30] like this, in my left hand I see the letter S and in my right hand I see the
[01:40:31] letter S and in my right hand I see the
[01:40:31] letter S and in my right hand I see the letter B.
[01:40:35] And so the front and back of the
[01:40:37] And so the front and back of the alphabet are mirror images of each
[01:40:38] alphabet are mirror images of each
[01:40:38] alphabet are mirror images of each other.
[01:40:40] other.
[01:40:40] other. Now I do Huh.
[01:40:45] Language.
[01:40:45] Language. Yeah, this could be a natural hand
[01:40:47] Yeah, this could be a natural hand
[01:40:47] Yeah, this could be a natural hand language. In fact, what I'm proposing is
[01:40:48] language. In fact, what I'm proposing is
[01:40:48] language. In fact, what I'm proposing is that this is the ideal language for
[01:40:51] that this is the ideal language for
[01:40:51] that this is the ideal language for hearing impaired people because it could
[01:40:53] hearing impaired people because it could
[01:40:53] hearing impaired people because it could be learned immediately by people who can
[01:40:55] be learned immediately by people who can
[01:40:55] be learned immediately by people who can hear. Everybody can visualize their own
[01:40:58] hear. Everybody can visualize their own
[01:40:58] hear. Everybody can visualize their own hands and these gestures have intrinsic
[01:41:01] hands and these gestures have intrinsic
[01:41:01] hands and these gestures have intrinsic meaning. That's why there are mudras and
[01:41:03] meaning. That's why there are mudras and
[01:41:03] meaning. That's why there are mudras and the eastern traditions because those
[01:41:05] the eastern traditions because those
[01:41:05] the eastern traditions because those gestures bring up particular feelings.
[01:41:09] gestures bring up particular feelings.
[01:41:09] gestures bring up particular feelings. Also, I wanted to point out that
[01:41:11] Also, I wanted to point out that
[01:41:11] Also, I wanted to point out that everything that I can do with my
[01:41:13] everything that I can do with my
[01:41:13] everything that I can do with my self-referential hand, my thumb to my
[01:41:16] self-referential hand, my thumb to my
[01:41:16] self-referential hand, my thumb to my hand, I can also do with my hand to my
[01:41:18] hand, I can also do with my hand to my
[01:41:18] hand, I can also do with my hand to my arm and my arm to my body. And just like
[01:41:22] arm and my arm to my body. And just like
[01:41:22] arm and my arm to my body. And just like there are 12 around one for this 13
[01:41:25] there are 12 around one for this 13
[01:41:25] there are 12 around one for this 13 petal rose fruit,
[01:41:28] petal rose fruit,
[01:41:28] petal rose fruit, there are also not counting the jaw or
[01:41:30] there are also not counting the jaw or
[01:41:30] there are also not counting the jaw or even counting the jaw, 12 joints in the
[01:41:32] even counting the jaw, 12 joints in the
[01:41:32] even counting the jaw, 12 joints in the body from the tip of my finger to the
[01:41:34] body from the tip of my finger to the
[01:41:34] body from the tip of my finger to the tip of my toe.
[01:41:36] tip of my toe.
[01:41:36] tip of my toe. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.
[01:41:45] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.
[01:41:45] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. And so we are 13 petal roses just as the
[01:41:49] And so we are 13 petal roses just as the
[01:41:49] And so we are 13 petal roses just as the introduction to the Zohar says. And
[01:41:51] introduction to the Zohar says. And
[01:41:51] introduction to the Zohar says. And mapping our body onto our mind, our body
[01:41:56] mapping our body onto our mind, our body
[01:41:56] mapping our body onto our mind, our body is mapped on the motor cortex of our
[01:41:59] is mapped on the motor cortex of our
[01:41:59] is mapped on the motor cortex of our mind is the same as mapping the where is
[01:42:03] mind is the same as mapping the where is
[01:42:03] mind is the same as mapping the where is it? the fruit tree onto the fruit.
[01:42:07] it? the fruit tree onto the fruit.
[01:42:07] it? the fruit tree onto the fruit. See, we are just like the fruit. Our
[01:42:11] See, we are just like the fruit. Our
[01:42:11] See, we are just like the fruit. Our mapped on our minds, on our seed, on our
[01:42:13] mapped on our minds, on our seed, on our
[01:42:13] mapped on our minds, on our seed, on our fruit, if you will, is our body is our
[01:42:15] fruit, if you will, is our body is our
[01:42:15] fruit, if you will, is our body is our life cycle. That's how we control
[01:42:17] life cycle. That's how we control
[01:42:17] life cycle. That's how we control ourselves. So, the embryionic metaphor
[01:42:20] ourselves. So, the embryionic metaphor
[01:42:20] ourselves. So, the embryionic metaphor for vegetable world fits in our world,
[01:42:22] for vegetable world fits in our world,
[01:42:22] for vegetable world fits in our world, too. I want to want to read something.
[01:42:23] too. I want to want to read something.
[01:42:23] too. I want to want to read something. Um, we started with the first verse of
[01:42:25] Um, we started with the first verse of
[01:42:25] Um, we started with the first verse of Genesis, but now we have individual
[01:42:28] Genesis, but now we have individual
[01:42:28] Genesis, but now we have individual translations for each of the letters.
[01:42:30] translations for each of the letters.
[01:42:30] translations for each of the letters. So, I could now read this first verse of
[01:42:33] So, I could now read this first verse of
[01:42:33] So, I could now read this first verse of Genesis off of the alphabet charts. What
[01:42:36] Genesis off of the alphabet charts. What
[01:42:36] Genesis off of the alphabet charts. What do you suppose it would say?
[01:42:39] do you suppose it would say?
[01:42:39] do you suppose it would say? Let me read it. You tell me what you
[01:42:41] Let me read it. You tell me what you
[01:42:41] Let me read it. You tell me what you think it says. Now, I could be using
[01:42:42] think it says. Now, I could be using
[01:42:42] think it says. Now, I could be using other words, and I'm picking these words
[01:42:44] other words, and I'm picking these words
[01:42:44] other words, and I'm picking these words off of the chart selectively, but I'm
[01:42:46] off of the chart selectively, but I'm
[01:42:46] off of the chart selectively, but I'm always using the same words for the same
[01:42:48] always using the same words for the same
[01:42:48] always using the same words for the same letter, so it makes it a little
[01:42:49] letter, so it makes it a little
[01:42:49] letter, so it makes it a little redundant. But listen to this. This is
[01:42:52] redundant. But listen to this. This is
[01:42:52] redundant. But listen to this. This is what's translated. In the beginning, God
[01:42:53] what's translated. In the beginning, God

[01:48:31] the first Genesis story and you said
[01:48:31] the first Genesis story and you said that there was embedded systems in in

[01:49:37] and economical way, we are going to be able to show that the sequence of
[01:49:38] able to show that the sequence of
[01:49:38] able to show that the sequence of letters in the text of Genesis is just
[01:49:40] letters in the text of Genesis is just
[01:49:40] letters in the text of Genesis is just as determined as the sequence of digits
[01:49:43] as determined as the sequence of digits
[01:49:43] as determined as the sequence of digits in the decimal expansion for pi.
[01:49:46] in the decimal expansion for pi.
[01:49:46] in the decimal expansion for pi. That is a natural artifact of this
[01:49:48] That is a natural artifact of this
[01:49:48] That is a natural artifact of this universe at the 11 level.
[01:49:51] universe at the 11 level.
[01:49:51] universe at the 11 level. In fact, that quality is very similar to
[01:49:55] In fact, that quality is very similar to
[01:49:55] In fact, that quality is very similar to pi. After all, the text, you're not
[01:49:56] pi. After all, the text, you're not
[01:49:56] pi. After all, the text, you're not supposed to change a letter, it' be
[01:49:58] supposed to change a letter, it' be
[01:49:58] supposed to change a letter, it' be destruction of the universe. If you
[01:50:00] destruction of the universe. If you
[01:50:00] destruction of the universe. If you changed any digit in pi, it wouldn't be
[01:50:02] changed any digit in pi, it wouldn't be
[01:50:02] changed any digit in pi, it wouldn't be pi.
[01:50:04] pi.
[01:50:04] pi. Same kind of thing. Who wrote pi? Did
[01:50:05] Same kind of thing. Who wrote pi? Did
[01:50:05] Same kind of thing. Who wrote pi? Did God write pi or man write pi? You know,
[01:50:08] God write pi or man write pi? You know,
[01:50:08] God write pi or man write pi? You know, there are uh statistitians who've shown
[01:50:10] there are uh statistitians who've shown
[01:50:10] there are uh statistitians who've shown that there were letter patterns
[01:50:12] that there were letter patterns
[01:50:12] that there were letter patterns throughout the books of Moses. Um the
[01:50:15] throughout the books of Moses. Um the
[01:50:15] throughout the books of Moses. Um the observant people, the religious people
[01:50:17] observant people, the religious people
[01:50:17] observant people, the religious people say, "Well, that proves only God could
[01:50:18] say, "Well, that proves only God could
[01:50:18] say, "Well, that proves only God could have done it because how could you write
[01:50:19] have done it because how could you write

[01:50:21] these intense, deeply, you know,
[01:50:21] these intense, deeply, you know, convoluted mathematical patterns and
[01:50:22] convoluted mathematical patterns and
[01:50:22] convoluted mathematical patterns and still have it read like text and the
[01:50:25] still have it read like text and the
[01:50:25] still have it read like text and the Bible scholars who don't believe
[01:50:26] Bible scholars who don't believe
[01:50:26] Bible scholars who don't believe anything said, "Oh, that proves that

[01:50:30] That man had to have made it up like a double cross that Ezra sat there and
[01:50:32] double cross that Ezra sat there and
[01:50:32] double cross that Ezra sat there and worked out all these patterns.
[01:50:34] worked out all these patterns.
[01:50:34] worked out all these patterns. And they both are using the same
[01:50:35] And they both are using the same
[01:50:35] And they both are using the same evidence to prove the opposite. But I'm
[01:50:38] evidence to prove the opposite. But I'm
[01:50:38] evidence to prove the opposite. But I'm saying they're both missing the point
[01:50:40] saying they're both missing the point
[01:50:40] saying they're both missing the point that pi is not written by God or man
[01:50:43] that pi is not written by God or man
[01:50:43] that pi is not written by God or man alone. Pi is determined by God, by
[01:50:45] alone. Pi is determined by God, by
[01:50:45] alone. Pi is determined by God, by nature, by reality, but it's written in
[01:50:47] nature, by reality, but it's written in
[01:50:47] nature, by reality, but it's written in our number system for our benefit. The
[01:50:50] our number system for our benefit. The
[01:50:50] our number system for our benefit. The pattern in in in the Bible in in the
[01:50:52] pattern in in in the Bible in in the
[01:50:52] pattern in in in the Bible in in the Torah is a pattern of creation, not
[01:50:54] Torah is a pattern of creation, not
[01:50:54] Torah is a pattern of creation, not because some religious fanatic said so,
[01:50:57] because some religious fanatic said so,
[01:50:57] because some religious fanatic said so, but because like pi, it is demonstrable
[01:51:00] but because like pi, it is demonstrable
[01:51:00] but because like pi, it is demonstrable from this reality and co-generates this
[01:51:02] from this reality and co-generates this
[01:51:02] from this reality and co-generates this reality.
[01:51:04] reality.

[01:51:06] So that we ought to be able to unfurl
[01:51:06] So that we ought to be able to unfurl the sequence of letters. Here's another
[01:51:08] the sequence of letters. Here's another
[01:51:08] the sequence of letters. Here's another way. Here's another problem. People have
[01:51:10] way. Here's another problem. People have
[01:51:10] way. Here's another problem. People have said that the five books of Moses can't
[01:51:11] said that the five books of Moses can't
[01:51:11] said that the five books of Moses can't have all been sacred. can't have all
[01:51:13] have all been sacred. can't have all
[01:51:13] have all been sacred. can't have all come from God because they were written
[01:51:15] come from God because they were written
[01:51:15] come from God because they were written supposedly over a thousand years. So,
[01:51:17] supposedly over a thousand years. So,
[01:51:17] supposedly over a thousand years. So, how could these patterns go from one
[01:51:18] how could these patterns go from one
[01:51:18] how could these patterns go from one text to the other unless someone
[01:51:19] text to the other unless someone
[01:51:19] text to the other unless someone redacted them all together? But everyone
[01:51:22] redacted them all together? But everyone
[01:51:22] redacted them all together? But everyone knows, and I'm not good at this, if
[01:51:24] knows, and I'm not good at this, if
[01:51:24] knows, and I'm not good at this, if you're doing something in Tai Chi or if

[01:51:56] anything but stand upright on the surfboard.
[01:51:58] surfboard.
[01:51:58] surfboard. In fact, standing upright on the
[01:52:00] In fact, standing upright on the
[01:52:00] In fact, standing upright on the surfboard is a very good analogy for all
[01:52:02] surfboard is a very good analogy for all
[01:52:02] surfboard is a very good analogy for all of this because in tommet there is a
[01:52:05] of this because in tommet there is a
[01:52:05] of this because in tommet there is a phrase used to designate a person of
[01:52:07] phrase used to designate a person of
[01:52:07] phrase used to designate a person of integrity. They were called topho
[01:52:10] integrity. They were called topho
[01:52:10] integrity. They were called topho kavaro. That means that their outside is
[01:52:13] kavaro. That means that their outside is
[01:52:13] kavaro. That means that their outside is just like their inside.
[01:52:15] just like their inside.
[01:52:15] just like their inside. But if you can make your outside like
[01:52:18] But if you can make your outside like
[01:52:18] But if you can make your outside like your inside, these are inversions to
[01:52:20] your inside, these are inversions to
[01:52:20] your inside, these are inversions to each other. Bringing your outside and
[01:52:22] each other. Bringing your outside and
[01:52:22] each other. Bringing your outside and inside together is symbolically
[01:52:25] inside together is symbolically
[01:52:25] inside together is symbolically self-abnigation.
[01:52:26] self-abnigation.
[01:52:26] self-abnigation. That's the meditation. That's the loss
[01:52:29] That's the meditation. That's the loss

[01:52:36] Aladdin's lamp. Alladen, the judgment of

[01:52:45] don't know if you want to use your ego
[01:52:45] don't know if you want to use your ego there, but that's where reality becomes
[01:52:48] there, but that's where reality becomes
[01:52:48] there, but that's where reality becomes flexible. So, this understanding of an

[01:52:57] the greatest scientific achievements
[01:52:57] the greatest scientific achievements imaginable would be the discovery of an

[01:53:07] If we can bring inside and outside

[01:53:22] the roots of consciousness. Okay.
[01:53:25] Okay.
[01:53:25] Okay. Um I do a lot of yoga. So I I was

[01:53:38] purely from the man. All I did was let
[01:53:38] purely from the man. All I did was let Akam shave himself.
[01:53:43] Look, that's what the text says. Here is
[01:53:45] Look, that's what the text says. Here is a string of letters that folds up into a
[01:53:47] a string of letters that folds up into a
[01:53:48] a string of letters that folds up into a form that makes the letters that the
[01:53:50] form that makes the letters that the
[01:53:50] form that makes the letters that the text is written in. And the string of
[01:53:51] text is written in. And the string of

[01:53:53] letters also specifies how you walk

[01:53:56] around the form to make the letters. AAM
[01:53:56] around the form to make the letters. AAM is shaving himself. There ain't no AAM
[01:53:57] is shaving himself. There ain't no AAM

[01:54:08] where it results.
[01:54:08] where it results. I should go to the side.
[01:54:09] I should go to the side.
[01:54:09] I should go to the side. Yeah. Um, is there any argument that
[01:54:11] Yeah. Um, is there any argument that
[01:54:11] Yeah. Um, is there any argument that Hebrew isn't the foundation of all
[01:54:13] Hebrew isn't the foundation of all
[01:54:13] Hebrew isn't the foundation of all languages? Is that what I'm picking up?
[01:54:15] languages? Is that what I'm picking up?
[01:54:15] languages? Is that what I'm picking up? No, I'm not saying that. In fact, what
[01:54:17] No, I'm not saying that. In fact, what
[01:54:17] No, I'm not saying that. In fact, what I'm saying is that
[01:54:21] well, my feeling is that this is
[01:54:23] well, my feeling is that this is intrinsic to consciousness. And so,
[01:54:27] intrinsic to consciousness. And so,
[01:54:27] intrinsic to consciousness. And so, in some sense, this language was created
[01:54:30] in some sense, this language was created
[01:54:30] in some sense, this language was created with the creation of the universe. And
[01:54:32] with the creation of the universe. And
[01:54:32] with the creation of the universe. And therefore all living things at all
[01:54:34] therefore all living things at all
[01:54:34] therefore all living things at all levels at all times have partaken of it.
[01:54:37] levels at all times have partaken of it.
[01:54:37] levels at all times have partaken of it. But in our historical stream whatever

[01:54:56] obviously picked up on it. In Islamic
[01:54:56] obviously picked up on it. In Islamic Spain, the Muslims, the Christians, and
[01:54:57] Spain, the Muslims, the Christians, and
[01:54:57] Spain, the Muslims, the Christians, and the Jews had a lovely time together for
[01:54:59] the Jews had a lovely time together for
[01:54:59] the Jews had a lovely time together for a while till the Inquisition showed up
[01:55:01] a while till the Inquisition showed up
[01:55:01] a while till the Inquisition showed up and they shared all of this knowledge
[01:55:03] and they shared all of this knowledge
[01:55:03] and they shared all of this knowledge and they reelaborated what the Greeks I
[01:55:05] and they reelaborated what the Greeks I
[01:55:06] and they reelaborated what the Greeks I mean they there are there are references
[01:55:07] mean they there are there are references
[01:55:08] mean they there are there are references that say that Pythagoras studied with
[01:55:09] that say that Pythagoras studied with

[01:55:12] the Sanhedrin and the Sanhedrin studied
[01:55:12] the Sanhedrin and the Sanhedrin studied the Pthagorian material because they had
[01:55:14] the Pthagorian material because they had
[01:55:14] the Pthagorian material because they had to know the secular and world also. And
[01:55:17] to know the secular and world also. And
[01:55:17] to know the secular and world also. And so these high traditions knew each
[01:55:19] so these high traditions knew each
[01:55:19] so these high traditions knew each other, knew of each other. This was what
[01:55:21] other, knew of each other. This was what
[01:55:21] other, knew of each other. This was what I what I think we've got here is is a
[01:55:23] I what I think we've got here is is a
[01:55:23] I what I think we've got here is is a fundamental worldview of the ancient
[01:55:25] fundamental worldview of the ancient
[01:55:25] fundamental worldview of the ancient world but kept in its pure form in its
[01:55:29] world but kept in its pure form in its

[01:55:32] survivable intact form in the scripture
[01:55:32] survivable intact form in the scripture that's come down to us. Um
[01:55:36] that's come down to us. Um
[01:55:36] that's come down to us. Um but we we can relate that to uh canan
[01:55:40] but we we can relate that to uh canan
[01:55:40] but we we can relate that to uh canan and back to sume. I thought that's
[01:55:42] and back to sume. I thought that's
[01:55:42] and back to sume. I thought that's already been proven. I mean uh Hebrew is
[01:55:46] already been proven. I mean uh Hebrew is
[01:55:46] already been proven. I mean uh Hebrew is the oldest dialogue of Canaan.
[01:55:48] the oldest dialogue of Canaan.
[01:55:48] the oldest dialogue of Canaan. All right. Let me there's a difference
[01:55:49] All right. Let me there's a difference
[01:55:49] All right. Let me there's a difference between knowing this technically and
[01:55:51] between knowing this technically and
[01:55:52] between knowing this technically and understanding its depth. The Greeks
[01:55:55] understanding its depth. The Greeks
[01:55:55] understanding its depth. The Greeks helanized supposedly this material into
[01:55:58] helanized supposedly this material into
