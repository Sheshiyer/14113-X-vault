[00:32] My approach is that of science.
[00:35] Scholars try to demonstrate that their
[00:37] thesis is true. The essence of science
[00:40] is falsifiability. It's my job if I come
[00:43] up with an idea to use all my skills to
[00:46] prove I'm wrong. So I'm always trying to
[00:49] find the most minimum, the most elegant
[00:52] solution. And I'm always trying to
[00:53] figure out how it could be accidental,
[00:55] how it could be misleading me, how it
[00:57] could be just a coincidence.
[01:00] When you ring this down to its essence,
[01:04] you end up, and you can see this on the
[01:06] website, you end up with some of these
[01:08] models.
[01:11] It turns out that each one of those
[01:12] turns
[01:14] turns into a into a loop. And there's
[01:16] two halves each loop. And
[01:19] you end up with
[01:24] a number of geometric forms that are
[01:26] based on smoke rings.
[01:29] Now, it says at the beginning of the the
[01:31] Zohar is is a a cobalistic work
[01:34] so-called that the scholars claim is a
[01:36] pious forgery made up by Moses DeLeon in
[01:40] medieval times.
[01:42] Um, it's recently being re-ransated by
[01:45] Daniel Matt, a scholar worked for Jack
[01:48] Mgram in California.
[01:50] Matt is a very diligent scholar. Matt
[01:52] hasn't got a clue as to what the deep
[01:54] meaning of it is. And the scholar's
[01:55] opinion of the Zohar is it's a pious
[01:57] forgery. There's no real meaning at all.
[01:59] These are just speculations, musing. In
[02:01] the section on Genesis, it's in the we
[02:05] have packets at the back. It's in one of
[02:07] our etorus.
[02:09] It says in the Zohar, in the section on
[02:12] Genesis that it's about something that
[02:14] forms in the in in the formlessness and
[02:17] thrust in a ring. and he references the
[02:20] words for forming and formless as thrust
[02:21] in a ring and he refers to it to smoke
[02:23] and a smoke ring and he doesn't make the
[02:26] association.
[02:28] This is made by the zero blaster company
[02:30] in uh I think it's in conquered mass.
[02:32] It's a little piston and a chamber which
[02:35] you fill up with heated glycerin or
[02:37] glycerol of some sort. It's non-toxic.
[02:40] And then you pull back on the plunger
[02:42] and it makes little smoke rings.
[02:45] Forming and formlessness thrust in a
[02:47] ring.
[02:49] The the formlessness is the smoke. It's
[02:52] just telling you that the air has no
[02:54] form. It's it's not it's not anything
[02:55] but a tracer to show you that there's
[02:57] nothing going on. But when you pull back
[02:59] and let go, the little bellows action
[03:03] makes smoke rings.
[03:05] Well, it turns out in modern physics, if
[03:08] you start with no thing, the first thing
[03:10] topologically that can form is something
[03:13] where the no thing falls through itself,
[03:15] there being nothing else to happen that
[03:17] forms a kind of smoke ring. So, this is
[03:20] both a solution to what the Zohar is
[03:22] actually saying, a description of the
[03:25] smoke ring in Genesis
[03:27] and good modern physics. And not only
[03:29] that, but what we're going to discover,
[03:33] which is what this talk is about, is
[03:35] that it's all based on the golden rule.
