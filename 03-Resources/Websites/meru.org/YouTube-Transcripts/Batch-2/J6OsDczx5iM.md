[00:31] well um I want to thank you all for
[00:33] coming um my name is Stan Tenon and I
[00:36] work for the meu foundation and that's
[00:38] my wife Cynthia um who does most of the
[00:41] work work and I do most of the play work
[00:44] um this is sort of the 10th anniversary
[00:47] show um we did the original tape for
[00:49] This research here about 10 years ago um
[00:53] and um things have grown and changed
[00:55] some in that time there's been one
[00:57] really major development um and the rest
[01:00] is um a lot of what I thought was going
[01:03] to happen turned out really did happen
[01:05] in terms of how the models worked out um
[01:08] no one should believe what I'm saying
[01:11] it's not that I'm telling you anything I
[01:12] don't think is so it's just that you
[01:14] really need to be skeptical about this
[01:16] sort of thing um this is work in
[01:18] progress It's an honest research I speak
[01:21] quickly and I may say is when I mean
[01:24] when I mean based on the models and
[01:27] based on the references it's my best
[01:30] conjecture that this is so uh I'm not
[01:34] saying absolute truth when I say is I'm
[01:37] just trying to fit things into a short
[01:38] time
[01:39] period
[01:41] um this is very controversial material
[01:44] because um in the words of a friendly
[01:47] scholar it can't be
[01:48] so um and what of course he means is
[01:51] that if it is so then there's a lot of
[01:53] Readjustment to make um and I try to
[01:56] explain to people that this really
[01:57] doesn't say anything like I'm right
[01:59] you're all wrong um it says rather that
[02:02] this is a deeper level that integrates a
[02:04] whole range of material and it
[02:07] demonstrates mostly that what the
[02:08] scholars have been saying and what the
[02:10] religious people have been saying um and
[02:12] what the different religious people have
[02:14] been saying theyve all been right but in
[02:16] their own contexts and that if you go
[02:18] deeper then you find something more
[02:20] common um there's almost no good place
[02:24] to start but maybe in the interest of
[02:26] seeing who else will show up before we
[02:28] really get into it I'll give you a quick
[02:30] rundown of how this all started there
[02:32] are a few people that probably don't
[02:33] know um I was working for um an
[02:36] engineering company in uh Cambridge
[02:39] Massachusetts in
[02:41] 1967 and um I had to tell the boss that
[02:44] he had made a mistake and he didn't like
[02:47] that so he fired me um but then he
[02:49] discovered that he couldn't fire me
[02:51] because I'd never had a vacation so um I
[02:54] had to take a vacation and then he got
[02:56] to cool off and of course he didn't fire
[02:57] me well I was you know attached and and
[03:01] was getting paid handsomely and didn't
[03:03] have any real connections or plans or
[03:05] anything and hadn't been any place or
[03:06] done anything so I had three weeks and I
[03:10] simply um I was in Boston so I I went to
[03:13] I guess it was still um Idle Wild I
[03:14] don't know if it was Kennedy field
[03:16] Canada the airport yet and got on the
[03:18] first plane for uh London and Paris and
[03:20] I had a friend in Israel so I went to
[03:22] Israel um and I had no connection with
[03:24] any religious material or anything like
[03:26] that um I went to Hebrew school and was
[03:28] B Mitzvah and managed to learn to read
[03:30] the alphabet but I hadn't learned to
[03:32] read Hebrew I didn't know any vocabulary
[03:34] any grammar a few words I could read
[03:37] street signs and I also paid no
[03:39] attention to any of this um I was by
[03:42] mitford when I was 13 and that was the
[03:44] last time I was in a synagogue or looked
[03:46] at any of that material because everyone
[03:47] knows it's a bunch of old mythology and
[03:50] it's kind of out of date and there's a
[03:51] lot of rituals and there a lot you got
[03:53] to go through a lot of trouble to keep
[03:54] all the rules and you know who needs
[03:56] this stuff um I um
[04:00] I had studied uh a lot of mathematical
[04:03] things that fascinated me and I was on a
[04:05] on a math team in high school I never
[04:07] competed but I was on the backup and um
[04:10] and they they drilled you in instant
[04:12] pattern
[04:13] recognition um because if you didn't get
[04:15] the answer before the teacher finished
[04:16] putting on the board your team was going
[04:17] to lose so you really had to gr it
[04:20] instantly and see the essence of the
[04:22] problem and pull it
[04:25] out well um I go to um Israel this was
[04:29] the old L airport um was an old quanset
[04:32] Hut and their baggage handling system
[04:34] was pilot all the middle and use a one
[04:36] of these forklift things and just sort
[04:38] of rake it up occasionally and people
[04:40] would climb the mountain pull their bags
[04:42] down you know um and I had no plans um
[04:45] we got into a cab and asked the cab
[04:48] driver to take us to
[04:49] Jerusalem right take me to your
[04:53] leader and um this was in August
[04:57] 1967 and the Israelis had just retaken
[05:01] the old city in June and some of the
[05:03] people that had worked at this company
[05:05] um were involved in Israel and they had
[05:09] gone off to be pilots during The Six Day
[05:11] War and some of them stayed and uh one
[05:14] of my friends there um had um moved his
[05:17] family and bought a house in hen and he
[05:19] invited me to visit which is what
[05:20] prompted the visit um so I had some
[05:24] friends and and you know I was playing
[05:26] theour around which is what we did but
[05:28] um getting the cab the cab driver takes
[05:31] us up through the old winding road to
[05:32] Jerusalem they hadn't opened the super
[05:34] highway yet and he drops us at the gate
[05:36] to the old city that's nearest to the
[05:38] Western Wall to the temple which is a
[05:41] very holy place to Jews and which had
[05:43] just been cleared um the things had
[05:45] calmed down a little bit was August the
[05:47] the war was over in in beginning of
[05:49] June and um it was all very spontaneous
[05:53] I I really wasn't thinking about it you
[05:55] could see the young Israeli soldiers
[05:58] carrying weapons looking looking very
[06:00] proud and very happy because they had
[06:02] taken the center and you could see the
[06:05] Palestinians feeling pretty much the
[06:08] opposite they clearly were not happy and
[06:10] were not likely to be happy and um it
[06:14] was a very moving scene I mean it was
[06:16] very you know couldn't really get a
[06:19] sense so I I start walking towards
[06:21] towards the wall and a guy grabs me and
[06:23] puts a cardboard hat on my head um which
[06:26] is what they do and I go up to the wall
[06:28] and I just started right um I mean there
[06:31] was really nothing else to do it was
[06:33] both you know gee this is really
[06:34] dramatic there's this old Temple here
[06:36] and and it was also there's this this
[06:38] people that are really turned on and
[06:40] there's people that are really unhappy
[06:41] and and for better or worse I I uh I
[06:45] made a simple prayer I said you know if
[06:47] there's anything I can do let me know um
[06:50] it was either a very stupid or very
[06:51] smart thing to say depending on your
[06:53] point of view um and um I didn't think
[06:56] much more of it um we tour the country I
[06:59] went back back of course and spent some
[07:00] time in Paris um and spent some time in
[07:03] London and went back to um Boston and
[07:06] went back to work um a year
[07:10] later I'm sitting in my apartment in
[07:13] Newton Massachusetts over the
[07:15] turnpike practically and um there's a TV
[07:20] show on um called The Prisoner hosted by
[07:24] um the star was Patrick McAn and it's a
[07:27] metaphysical series and I won't go into
[07:30] it it's a spy who tries to get out of
[07:31] the Spy business and they kidnap him and
[07:33] he doesn't know which side kidnapped
[07:34] them anyhow goes on and on um there's an
[07:38] episode of course with a code because
[07:39] spies are into codes it was actually the
[07:42] added episode that they hadn't even
[07:43] planned to do the one called do not
[07:45] forsake me oh my darling if anyone
[07:47] remembers about out of- body experiences
[07:49] this was in
[07:51] 1968 it was almost exactly a year to the
[07:53] day from when I'd been in Jerusalem and
[07:56] Along Comes This episode with the code
[07:58] and something in my brain goes click and
[08:00] says you know I just
[08:03] wonder I wonder if I should look at the
[08:05] beginning of the Hebrew
[08:09] Bible Well I didn't even know know if I
[08:11] had a copy in the house but I searched
[08:13] around and I actually found the the um
[08:16] printed book form of the Hebrew Bible
[08:18] that they gave me when I was by mitford
[08:20] it was my neighbor gave it to me and I
[08:22] never really opened it and so I opened
[08:25] to the first
[08:26] page um and it says in the beginning God
[08:29] created the Heaven and the Earth and
[08:31] there's the Hebrew line and I don't read
[08:34] Hebrew
[08:36] words so my eyes fall on the letters
[08:39] it's like when you're seeing news film
[08:42] of an airlot plane landing and it says
[08:45] aeroflot and cilic you maybe you don't
[08:48] know cilic but you can dope it out
[08:49] because some of the letters are the same
[08:51] and you know what it's supposed to say
[08:52] your eyes full on the letters you try to
[08:54] figure out what it says well my eyes
[08:56] fell on the sequence of letters at the
[08:57] beginning of Genesis and and all of the
[09:00] old programs in my brain from the math
[09:03] team class went off and said this is
[09:06] crazy this isn't language this is a
[09:08] pattern somebody made a puzzle
[09:10] here and I all in the same instant I
[09:13] said one this can't be true million and
[09:15] one against I'm just seeing things two
[09:17] if it is true there's an obvious simple
[09:19] explanation all the Bible scholars know
[09:20] about this they just didn't tell me I
[09:22] wasn't listening um and three if it's
[09:26] really a pattern and if it's not just in
[09:28] the first verse
[09:30] and if the Bible scholars don't know
[09:32] about it or can explain it then even if
[09:35] the odds are a million to one against
[09:37] its being real those might be good odds
[09:40] because it might actually be important
[09:42] very important we're looking at the root
[09:44] document of Western
[09:46] civilization and many people have made
[09:49] all kinds of claims about it and people
[09:51] obviously have very strong
[09:52] beliefs well I was very naive I knew
[09:55] nothing um I was in Boston I think I
[09:57] asked the Catholic priest first he was
[09:59] very friendly um he obviously had no
[10:01] idea what I was talking about um so I
[10:04] said okay well I'll ask a
[10:07] rabbi um same result he wasn't quite as
[10:11] friendly um I asked a fellow at um well
[10:14] I asked some friends and finally someone
[10:16] said um may have been
[10:18] someone I remember if I called the
[10:20] people at Harvard or MIT first but
[10:22] anyhow someone said it's got to be
[10:23] cabala and I said I'd never heard of
[10:26] cabala so again having a pocket ET full
[10:29] of cash and nothing to do with my life I
[10:31] went to the bookstores and bought
[10:32] everything
[10:33] inside eastern western Hindu Buddhist
[10:37] Muslim Christian Jewish academic
[10:40] religious channeled flying Sorcerers you
[10:43] name it I read
[10:44] it
[10:46] um over 10 years about 3,000 volumes
[10:49] some of them are skinny you know those
[10:51] old books weren't very thick um and
[10:55] obviously I got a sense that something
[10:57] was going on here here is this whole
[11:00] body of literature the most
[11:02] distinguishing characteristic of which
[11:05] was none of it made any sense at least
[11:07] not to
[11:08] me um the scholars seemed to think it
[11:11] was poetry or Superstition or personal
[11:15] fantasy or somebody made it up or one
[11:19] group took it from another group um the
[11:21] religious people of course believed in
[11:23] it all implicitly and didn't want to
[11:24] discuss
[11:25] it um and um I think I accumulated
[11:29] something like 10 or 12 translations of
[11:32] the seph yser the book of
[11:35] formation which describes the Hebrew
[11:37] alphabet now I got to tell you something
[11:39] about this this is a little discouraging
[11:41] you know if I walked into a room
[11:42] carrying a book that said chemistry
[11:44] translated from the
[11:45] French and I read it I'd expect by the
[11:49] end of the book even though it was a
[11:50] translation if it was a decent
[11:52] translation it was going to teach me a
[11:53] little chemistry that was its title well
[11:56] here's a book that says book of
[11:58] formation
[11:59] and everyone knows it's about the
[12:02] letters and they discuss everything
[12:03] you'd ever want to know about the Hebrew
[12:05] letters except they never mention the
[12:06] form of the letters nor did they provide
[12:08] the form none of these translations
[12:11] Deliver Us on the title of the
[12:13] book well obviously that wasn't very
[12:17] satisfying and clearly there was
[12:18] something going on here and it took me a
[12:20] long time to get even any sense of it I
[12:23] also tried every complicated think I
[12:24] could think of to pull the pattern out
[12:26] of the sequence of letters in the text
[12:28] and none of it worked and the reason
[12:30] none of it worked was because I was
[12:32] doing lots of sophisticated modern
[12:33] things which obviously if the pattern
[12:35] were there it was a few thousand years
[12:37] old they didn't do that so the tools I
[12:40] was using were not appropriate the tools
[12:43] had to be temporally appropriate they
[12:44] had to be contemporaneous with the text
[12:46] if I couldn't show that what I found was
[12:50] findable knowable in the ancient world
[12:52] then I was either diluted or making it
[12:54] up or you know that didn't make sense so
[12:56] it had to be had to be grounded in
[12:57] reality
[12:59] well 10 years go by and Cynthia and I
[13:01] moved to San Francisco and KQ is
[13:03] rebroadcasting the prisoner
[13:07] 1978 and Jim scallum is running a
[13:09] fundraiser and we volunteered to go on
[13:12] the air and do a little wraparound
[13:13] discussion on the prisoner episodes
[13:15] which caught on and so we got to do it
[13:18] regularly um we never quite joined the
[13:20] union but we got close the the union
[13:22] people actually let us on even when
[13:24] without joining the union it was very
[13:25] nice to them and um so we're doing a
[13:28] live 10 minutes and a tape 20 minutes
[13:30] for the rebroadcast we get to the same
[13:33] episode and um by then I had lots of
[13:36] theories about this text and I actually
[13:38] a whole list of criteria about what was
[13:40] possible and what to look for one of the
[13:41] things I was looking for was something
[13:43] comparable and I realized that the arbo
[13:45] message that was sent out of the arbo
[13:48] radio telescope which was designed by
[13:49] some people associated with JPL was an
[13:52] attempt to communicate to people that
[13:53] didn't speak our language over thousands
[13:56] of years of SpaceTime and so I thought
[13:59] would use the same principles maybe look
[14:00] for something a little more subtle or
[14:02] maybe more appropriate to the ancient
[14:03] world but nevertheless same idea if
[14:05] you're going to communicate over a
[14:06] couple thousand years you really have to
[14:09] keep the key in the message it's got to
[14:11] be easily accessible it has to open up
[14:13] for
[14:15] itself well I discussed this on the air
[14:18] I put the beginning of Genesis on the TV
[14:21] screen live in San Francisco but I wrote
[14:24] the text out numerically I replaced the
[14:25] letters with the numbers a is 1 B is 2 C
[14:28] is three
[14:30] um the standard numerological gatria
[14:32] values that are associated with the
[14:34] Hebrew Greek and Arabic letters and I
[14:37] told people it was like the rbo message
[14:39] and I told the them the rbo message was
[14:41] was in binary code um and people
[14:44] suggested ultimately I try trary tary
[14:47] base three and when I did that things
[14:50] started to work now I'm not going to
[14:52] have time to go into all of that it's on
[14:54] the earlier
[14:55] videotapes um what I found is that there
[14:57] were certain symmetries natural to the
[14:59] sequence of to the alphabet when you did
[15:00] that you count the Letters Out in base
[15:02] three and then you compare letters that
[15:04] have symmetrical numbers in base three
[15:06] which turns out if you interpret them as
[15:09] cartisian coordinates to put the letters
[15:11] in symmetrical positions on a 3x3x3
[15:14] cube similar to a rubic cube except
[15:16] there's really a qbb in the middle
[15:18] there's 27 letters in the full long
[15:20] alphabet and they each lay out on the
[15:22] cube the alive is at the
[15:24] origin um and the final stting the last
[15:27] letter is at the far diag Al and letters
[15:30] across the main diagonal of the cube
[15:32] have symmetrical positions and
[15:34] symmetrical base three counts so you can
[15:36] associate them also there's an older 22l
[15:40] alphabet um which is said to have front
[15:42] back
[15:43] symmetry um the last letter in that
[15:46] alphabet is a t so the a compares to the
[15:48] T and the B compares to the S and that's
[15:50] called atbash which is an acronym for
[15:54] atbs in Hebrew um I made use of both the
[15:58] symmetry of the model that I was working
[16:01] with and of this traditional symmetry
[16:04] system and that naturally grouped the
[16:06] letters into the Clusters this is all up
[16:08] on the website so people can get that
[16:10] and then when I did that I was able to
[16:12] pair off all the letters at the
[16:14] beginning of the first verse of
[16:16] Genesis
[16:19] um by pair off I mean very simply what
[16:22] you do to make a little paper model you
[16:24] put tab a and Slot a and tab B and slot
[16:26] B I wrote the Letters Out one letter
[16:28] each on a bead on a bead chain but left
[16:30] them so they could move them around but
[16:31] stay in the same order curled the bead
[16:33] chain up until the letters paired off
[16:35] either the same letter with itself or
[16:38] letters that were in symmetrical
[16:39] positions on the cube and all the
[16:41] letters were accounted for and they were
[16:44] all presented in the same order in
[16:46] pairs there was a letter on one side of
[16:48] the cube then it was repeated then the
[16:51] letter on the other side of the cube and
[16:53] then the first letter again a a b a and
[16:57] the same for all the pairs that existed
[16:59] at the in the first verse I checked the
[17:01] text to see if the patterning was just
[17:03] in the first verse or whether it
[17:05] continued cuz I didn't want to waste my
[17:06] time if there was just a pattern in the
[17:07] first verse who cared anybody could make
[17:10] a simple pattern out of 28 letters and
[17:13] not only that it could be
[17:15] coincidence so I did some quick
[17:17] statistical tests and found some
[17:19] anomalies um where I expected to find
[17:22] them other words I predicted an anomaly
[17:24] and then found it and that's important
[17:26] because if I just went fishing it
[17:27] wouldn't meet as much
[17:29] and and I also played the text out
[17:31] musically to assure myself that the
[17:34] patterning continued and my year even
[17:37] allowing for the fact that God's name
[17:38] repeats all the time you get some very
[17:41] interesting sounds I think we'll play
[17:42] the tape at least in part um at a
[17:45] breakpoint perhaps when we have getting
[17:47] into this a little more so I'd assured
[17:49] myself the pattern continue this is
[17:51] before the statisticians did the Bible
[17:53] Code statistics so nobody knew about
[17:55] this and I'm looking at the first verse
[17:57] and I'm pairing off all the letter
[17:58] letters and I end up with a form which
[18:02] um is basically a spiral Vortex sitting
[18:05] on a
[18:06] Taurus now
[18:09] um there's a wonderful book by Arthur
[18:11] Young called the reflexive Universe
[18:13] which goes into the meaning of mapping
[18:16] the seven color map on a Taurus in a
[18:18] very symmetrical way and I'm not going
[18:20] to repeat that here either but the
[18:23] problem was I had this pattern from the
[18:25] first
[18:26] verse and that didn't mean mean anything
[18:29] either if you stare at the wallpaper for
[18:32] 10 years you're going to find the
[18:33] pattern in fact most wallpaper is
[18:35] pattern if you stand stare at blank TV
[18:37] screen you're going to see patterns
[18:39] finding a pattern is not hard
[18:41] particularly if you look long enough the
[18:44] question is is this pattern
[18:46] meaningful does it teach you anything
[18:48] does it say anything is it deliberate is
[18:50] it
[18:51] accidental and eventually I found um
[18:54] something I'm going to show you in
[18:55] another way from a different perspective
[18:57] in this talk I found that the pattern
[19:00] was meaningful that it ended up
[19:02] producing this little model which I call
[19:06] the light in the meeting tent or the
[19:07] Tetra flame it's a tetrahedron and
[19:10] inside of it is a little
[19:11] Vortex and the tetrahedron is supposed
[19:14] to represent a
[19:15] vessel and the vortex is supposed to
[19:19] represent a flame thus the idea of a
[19:21] light in a meeting tent it's an
[19:23] archetypal form in every culture you
[19:25] make campfires out of tripods of sticks
[19:28] and the flame comes up on the tripod at
[19:30] Deli they had a tripod with a serpent
[19:33] entwined around it actually it's a three
[19:34] Serpent and that turns out to be the
[19:36] full model and there um it looks
[19:39] surprisingly like the eternal flame that
[19:41] hangs in front of the altar in
[19:43] synagogues and churches looks like the
[19:45] green flame of Islam it was
[19:47] aesthetically very pleasing it's a model
[19:50] of perfect symmetry against perfect
[19:52] asymmetry in a specially related way
[19:56] um the tetrahedon the lowest order
[20:00] volume that has complete symmetry it's
[20:03] the most compact and simplest it's the
[20:06] most
[20:07] elegant and this Vortex and I'll show
[20:09] you how it's formed later turns out to
[20:12] be completely
[20:14] asymmetrical and the contrast between
[20:16] Symmetry and asymmetry is pretty
[20:18] absolute and we're going to talk about
[20:19] that because that's where I want to
[20:20] start this lecture and when you look at
[20:23] the little Vortex the asymmetrical flame
[20:25] through the symmetries of the
[20:27] tetrahedron you see outlines that look
[20:30] like all of the Hebrew Greek and Arabic
[20:32] letters whoa so the text folds up into a
[20:36] form that generates the letters in which
[20:38] the text is written now that's neat but
[20:42] don't be overly impressed if I had taken
[20:44] a coat hanger and bent it up with a
[20:46] couple of squiggles and play it around
[20:48] with my my Shadows I'd have found all
[20:49] the letters in just about any alphabet
[20:52] it is not hard to find Shadows of a
[20:54] squiggly form that look like
[20:57] letters it's hard to find a explicit
[21:00] meaningful form that does that and so
[21:03] it's the fact that that's a meaningful
[21:04] form that counts not just that you can
[21:06] make shadowgrams that make
[21:08] letters all right now I want to back up
[21:10] completely and I want to start over
[21:12] again that's sort of the story um and it
[21:14] wasn't wasn't over let me tell you
[21:15] what's wrong with this and this is where
[21:17] I left the tape 10 years ago now there
[21:19] are half a dozen lectures I've given
[21:21] since and so there's been a lot of
[21:22] development which we'll review but you
[21:24] know what's wrong with this it's very
[21:26] nice to say that it makes letters as
[21:28] Shadows
[21:29] but there's no regularity to it which
[21:32] way do I look at it where's the
[21:33] coordinate system and I developed a
[21:36] theory that the idea why they did this
[21:38] was so that if you could turn this over
[21:40] in your mind's eye you could repeat a
[21:42] meditation so a sequence of letters
[21:46] would be the specs for a dance in the
[21:48] mind but if you couldn't visualize the
[21:50] thing didn't know how to hold it and
[21:52] couldn't turn it over easily how could
[21:54] you use it what's the natural viewing
[21:57] position for it now I've got a lot of
[21:59] good answers to that and we found a
[22:01] coordinate system eventually but I don't
[22:03] want to go that way this time the the
[22:04] problem stands what form and you're
[22:08] going to know the answer because you all
[22:09] have the handouts but ask yourself what
[22:12] form can every human being immediately
[22:14] visualize in their own Mind's Eye and
[22:17] the answer we're going to find is a hand
[22:19] or what's in your
[22:20] hand all right I want to read a couple
[22:23] of different quotations and um you'll
[22:27] they'll catch up with us
[22:29] um before I do that I want to point out
[22:31] a few things on the board uh mostly this
[22:35] guy this is the letter bet bait it's the
[22:39] first letter of the text of Genesis it's
[22:41] the one translated in the its formal
[22:44] meaning is
[22:45] house but God's not a noun God's verb in
[22:49] Hebrew is a real mode language that
[22:51] means the primary roots are verbs not
[22:54] nouns so it's not a house it's housing
[22:57] it's what a house
[23:00] does most people don't pay any attention
[23:02] to this but in fact if you can check the
[23:04] references I think even David bone
[23:06] mentions this in in the quantum reality
[23:08] book which is so
[23:10] wonderful
[23:11] um a bait represents the distinction
[23:15] between inside and
[23:17] outside and that's going to turn out to
[23:19] be enormously important now the rabbis
[23:22] claim that all of the Torah all of the
[23:25] Bible is summarized in the first letter
[23:28] which is by the way written big on the
[23:30] Torah
[23:31] scroll and then they say more or less
[23:33] I'm going to speak freely that if you
[23:36] can't get it from the first letter God
[23:38] is very understanding and repeats it in
[23:40] more detail for you in the first word in
[23:43] the first verse in the first paragraph
[23:45] in the first
[23:46] chapter well it's a hierarchical array
[23:49] and the bigger the chunk you take the
[23:51] more data you get the higher the
[23:52] resolution but the image is always the
[23:54] same so what's the
[23:56] image well if this theory is write then
[23:59] the whole story should be in the first
[24:01] letter and in the first word we may get
[24:03] to the first verse but I'll try to stick
[24:05] to the beginning here
[24:08] um so we need to find out a little more
[24:10] about what this debate might might
[24:13] mean let me read you a quotation which I
[24:16] found very very helpful and um this was
[24:20] pointed out to me by um Professor Luke
[24:22] cman I believe a number of years ago um
[24:25] it's a quote from G Spencer Brown's book
[24:27] called the laws of form Spencer Brown um
[24:32] topologist proposes what he calls the
[24:34] mark of Distinction that archetypically
[24:37] distinguishes inside from outside as a
[24:40] definition of maximal
[24:42] contrast now we're going to get to it
[24:44] because it's important and if I don't
[24:45] get to it you should yell at me um
[24:47] maximal contrast is what this is all
[24:49] about there's a paper in the packet um
[24:52] called man bites dog maximum contrast is
[24:56] anomaly the thing that attracts our
[24:58] attention the very
[25:01] most uh mathematicians have shown that
[25:03] all of formal L all of all of formal
[25:07] logic can be derived from Spencer
[25:09] Brown's Mark of Distinction this is
[25:11] quoted from um the book um quote the
[25:15] theme of This Book Is that a universe
[25:18] comes into being we're talking about
[25:20] creation here when a space is severed or
[25:23] taken
[25:24] apart the skin of a living organism cuts
[25:28] off off an outside from an inside so
[25:31] does the circumference of a circle in a
[25:34] plane squaring the circle Maybe by
[25:37] tracing the way we represent such a
[25:39] severance we can begin to reconstruct
[25:41] with an accuracy and coverage that
[25:43] appear almost uncanny this is a
[25:45] mathematician
[25:46] speaking the basic forms underlying
[25:50] linguistic mathematical physical and
[25:53] biological
[25:55] science and can begin to see how the
[25:57] familiar familiar laws of our own
[25:59] experience follow
[26:05] inexorably from the original Act of
[26:08] sence although all forms and thus all
[26:10] universes are possible and any
[26:12] particular form is mutable it becomes
[26:14] evident that the laws relating such
[26:17] forms are the same in any Universe it's
[26:19] this sameness the idea that we can find
[26:21] a reality which is independent of how
[26:23] the universe actually appears that lends
[26:25] such Fascination to the study of
[26:27] mathematics
[26:29] now notice he's not talking about the
[26:31] things they're all different religious
[26:34] people would say don't paying attention
[26:36] to Idols he's talking about
[26:40] relationships and he's saying that
[26:42] there's a catalog of basic relationships
[26:44] which exist all over and that there's a
[26:47] basic bottom line set and he's going to
[26:50] generate some of this with his Mark of
[26:51] Distinction and it's a book that is
[26:54] worth trying to read I don't know if you
[26:55] can get through it easily but it's
[26:57] certainly worth as far as you can get
[27:01] um
[27:04] well that's what this is all about this
[27:08] bait represents that Mark of Distinction
[27:10] I'm going to
[27:11] claim and that it distinguishes inside
[27:14] from outside and it is related to the
[27:16] idea of a skin because in the Tomic
[27:22] tradition the understanding of who a
[27:25] righteous person is a person of
[27:27] integrity
[27:28] it's a person whose insides are like
[27:31] their outsides Toko
[27:33] cavaro um that's the kind of person who
[27:35] would be a saint or zadic that could
[27:38] perhaps do a very high
[27:40] meditation and if a person's insides and
[27:43] outsides are actually the same then they
[27:46] metaphorically have no skin there's no
[27:47] need for one and of course that's an ego
[27:50] death situation they're dissolved into
[27:53] the whatever there's no distinction
[27:55] there's no ego embodiment
[27:59] um so let's look
[28:03] at this is the first word of Genesis
[28:06] let's look at the first word of Genesis
[28:07] it's supposed to contain the whole
[28:09] secret it's supposed to be able to
[28:10] repeat this ba this basic idea in more
[28:12] detail so here's the
[28:15] baate which means in or in the and then
[28:17] we have this word
[28:19] RIS which is said to mean at the head of
[28:22] because the word re means head well
[28:25] there's another root in here which is
[28:27] not usually discussed and that's this
[28:30] route ret ret is a woven net or
[28:35] network and I'm going to say that the
[28:38] reason the academic statisticians have
[28:41] found letter skip patterns in the Hebrew
[28:45] Bible is because it's a woven document
[28:48] like a Navajo rug with stripes and if
[28:51] you unravel it you get skip patterns on
[28:53] the thread because that's what the
[28:56] stripes leave and I'm going to say that
[28:58] that's the kind of coding that was done
[29:00] in the ancient world and hopefully we'll
[29:02] get to
[29:03] that so the first thing we're told is in
[29:06] or with a
[29:08] net or some kind of network or something
[29:11] of that sort but there's other words
[29:13] here the the word um R Olive actually
[29:16] Olive R refers to light so we'll leave
[29:18] that but a olive Shin is the word for
[29:22] fire and shin sit is the word that means
[29:27] either six or Thorn
[29:29] and um if you combine those two you can
[29:31] easily see that a six
[29:33] Thorn is what we'd call a tetrahedron
[29:36] it's got six edges and they're prickly
[29:39] and if you put little sphere points on
[29:40] the tips of them they turn into a
[29:42] cuboctahedron eventually which is part
[29:44] of what we maybe we'll talk about and
[29:47] I'm going to say that this first verse
[29:50] that folds itself up to make these kind
[29:53] of Vortex patterns that when you make
[29:56] the uh the vortex the appropriate it
[29:58] shape totally asymmetrical and that
[30:01] means that certain kinds of spirals are
[30:03] excluded logarithmic spirals are
[30:06] self-similar they're too symmetrical so
[30:08] they can't be part of this um that this
[30:10] is like a flame this is like
[30:12] Consciousness this is fire this is this
[30:14] is the
[30:15] light and if we put the H in the sheath
[30:19] the light in the
[30:21] tent we get the light in the meeting
[30:23] tent which I derived from a totally
[30:25] different way 10 years ago when I
[30:28] couldn't analyze the word because I
[30:30] didn't know
[30:31] enough and I'm going to say as you go
[30:34] through the rest of the first verse
[30:35] where it says God created the Heaven and
[30:37] the Earth I'm going to say that the
[30:40] Earth is like a tetrahedron the four
[30:43] corners of the earth four
[30:46] corners and that heaven is like an
[30:48] expanse the
[30:50] flame and so that the first verse
[30:52] unfurls in the same manner but it more
[30:54] detail and we can go into those words
[30:56] but we're not going to do that now at
[30:57] least not this part of the
[30:59] talk so what we have here
[31:05] is a text that's been translated to give
[31:08] a fairy tale story about creation which
[31:10] some people take
[31:12] literally which has a very deep and long
[31:14] tradition that turns out to actually be
[31:17] meaningful literally meaningful but
[31:20] what's literal is the geometric
[31:23] metaphor not the story
[31:28] all right I want to go a little further
[31:31] here let's talk about this idea of
[31:33] Maximum
[31:35] contrast um there's a paper as I said
[31:38] called a little essay called man bites
[31:40] dog which will say this better than I'm
[31:42] going to say it right now and maybe a
[31:44] little clearer um Roger Penrose in the
[31:46] emperor's new mind points out something
[31:48] that people have known for a long time
[31:50] namely that life on Earth is due to the
[31:52] fact that the sun is a bright spot in
[31:54] the sky and sends out rather High
[31:58] information content visible photons
[32:01] which plants swallow and turn into the
[32:04] organization the self organization that
[32:06] is their life which we then eat and then
[32:08] the Earth plants all together radiate
[32:10] back out infrared photons which have
[32:14] less information content to the dark sky
[32:17] if the sky were all as bright as the sun
[32:19] then there'd be no difference and you
[32:22] couldn't radiate back out the cooler
[32:25] redder
[32:26] photons and so you couldn't extract any
[32:29] information and the plants couldn't
[32:30] couldn't grow and we wouldn't be here to
[32:32] eat them so life depends on the contrast
[32:36] between the Sun and the sky and that's
[32:38] pretty much accepted that's physical
[32:41] life that's the mechanical
[32:43] part and I'm saying that ultimately what
[32:46] we're going to be looking for here is
[32:48] not the attractor for the plants or for
[32:52] our plant-like mechanical being but
[32:55] rather the attractor for our
[32:57] consciousness
[32:58] what makes us self-aware where does the
[33:00] hyper information if you want to call it
[33:02] that that gives us self-awareness come
[33:04] from well let's just extrapolate let's
[33:07] just extend the
[33:09] process what attracts our attention is
[33:12] anomaly an anomal is basically high
[33:15] contrast if you see a bright spot you
[33:19] notice it you don't notice something
[33:21] that blends into the
[33:23] surroundings so let's
[33:26] hypothesize and this is a semi-
[33:28] technical situations so I I dare to use
[33:30] no I want to use a real pointer I always
[33:32] have the laser pointer but I don't think
[33:34] I like
[33:35] it um let's hypothesize what is now
[33:38] called a direct Delta
[33:40] function an infinite
[33:43] pulse has no duration in
[33:46] time has absolute maximum infinite
[33:50] amplitude compared to anything else in
[33:51] the universe if we were to run that
[33:54] through a wave analyzer to find its
[33:56] Spectrum if we to take a for8 transform
[33:59] of that direct Delta function we'd find
[34:01] a c of all wavelengths all possible
[34:05] frequencies at unit
[34:08] amplitude and obviously compared to this
[34:11] unit amplitude C of
[34:14] everything which is
[34:16] eternal otherwise the pulse is
[34:20] broadened against this background this
[34:22] is the highest possible
[34:25] contrast now I'm going to suggest and
[34:27] this is a paper on the website called
[34:29] the god of Abraham a mathematician's
[34:31] view that what Abraham did is not
[34:35] discover the one God like they tell you
[34:37] in school everybody already knew about
[34:39] the one God in fact they knew about too
[34:41] many one Gods people worshiped the
[34:44] mountains and the sky and the Sun and
[34:46] and and whatever else you might point
[34:48] out and also people had an internal
[34:50] spiritual experience in
[34:52] meditation of the single light in the
[34:55] mind
[34:58] what Abraham discovered was that you
[35:01] could set the two equal you could Define
[35:06] God as both
[35:10] Singularity and
[35:13] wholeness that the four-letter name of
[35:16] God refers to
[35:20] Singularity um that name is based and
[35:23] pronounced now on a root meaning
[35:25] pedestal a lord sits high high above you
[35:28] on a pedestal he's a bright light on a
[35:30] high pedestal tetrahedron is a
[35:33] pedestal the four-letter name is
[35:35] compared to the tetragramaton the Tetra
[35:38] is is the tetragrammaton it's compared
[35:39] to the tetrus the pattern
[35:45] of 10
[35:47] dots that
[35:50] had spiritual connotations to the Greeks
[35:53] that's a little
[35:54] triangle and if you pile up
[35:58] spheres it turns out to make a little
[36:00] tetrahedron I only showing four of them
[36:02] there it's a
[36:04] pedestal the name means
[36:07] pedestal the five letter name of God the
[36:09] one that comes a little later in the
[36:11] first sentence Elohim it's pronounced
[36:13] with an H but I'll say it with a K so as
[36:15] not to use the name um that ends in the
[36:19] Hebrew ending y IM L kimim yam yam means
[36:25] see if you look in a dictionary you
[36:27] final me means C it's a great
[36:32] expanse like a
[36:34] flame in fact what you can
[36:42] say let's see if I put it up here
[36:45] yet um yes that an expanse it's like an
[36:51] angular Sweep All
[36:54] Around just like all these frequencies
[36:58] from the beginning to the end of time
[37:00] all there
[37:01] is and this direct Delta function is
[37:04] like an extent it's a
[37:07] stretch there's one of these and there's
[37:09] many of those this one's in the mind
[37:12] this is the
[37:19] world if you combine the two you get the
[37:23] abrahamic definition of God The Credo of
[37:25] Judaism in the Torah is the statement
[37:30] which is said in prayers every day here
[37:33] o Israel the Lord that's the four-letter
[37:35] name our God that's the felter name the
[37:38] Lord is one they actually repeat the
[37:40] word Lord and that's a variation I don't
[37:42] want to get into but it's it fits nicely
[37:44] also they're basically saying
[37:47] set Lord and God together equal to
[37:51] Unity
[37:52] um haven't we heard something about that
[37:55] before uh isn't isn't there something in
[37:59] in quantum mechanics about Delta V Delta
[38:03] s equals is it h bar or something I
[38:06] maybe I got that wrong is that
[38:09] complimentarity um yeah um that's neat
[38:13] well in our case what we're going to
[38:14] look at I'll fit it here someplace is R
[38:18] Theta equal
[38:21] 1 R being the four-letter name Theta
[38:23] being the felter name geometric
[38:25] metaphors for them and that produces a
[38:28] curve a spiral and that spiral is
[38:33] known
[38:34] as this is um y = 1 as I didn't do it
[38:39] very well the reciprocal spiral the
[38:42] hyperbolic
[38:43] spiral it's the one that shows up under
[38:46] the eye of
[38:48] Horus it's the one that shows up in the
[38:51] book of Kels gratuitously in the drawing
[38:54] of every single one of those animals and
[38:56] other icons in the book of Kels it's the
[38:59] one that shows up on the top of ionic
[39:01] columns you know you make a Greek column
[39:03] it's got this thing around the top right
[39:06] well it's
[39:08] this it's um if you use the actual form
[39:11] with with the with the second name with
[39:13] the fourl name got repeated you get r s
[39:16] Theta then you get what is known as the
[39:18] lyus which does the same thing except
[39:20] it's ASM totic to the origin words it
[39:23] sags down because the square term this
[39:26] becomes of course the Christian
[39:28] Shepherd's
[39:31] crook um there's a lot of other things
[39:33] we could say about that spiral but the
[39:34] most important thing about it is that
[39:37] it's the most asymmetrical spiral you
[39:39] can make because it's a combination of
[39:42] the two possible lines you can have the
[39:44] two most different possible lines a
[39:46] straight line and a curved
[39:48] line and so you get the most
[39:50] asymmetrical spiral to compare to the
[39:53] most
[39:55] symmetrical vessel
[40:00] you put the light in the meeting tent
[40:01] you put the felter name in the
[40:02] four-letter name and and I'm going to
[40:04] suggest that that this model is a very
[40:07] modern model I'm saying that asymmetry
[40:10] and symmetry can compare can be compared
[40:12] to Unity and diversity the light in the
[40:13] meeting tent the one and the many wave
[40:15] and particle flame and coal radius and
[40:17] circumference Yang and Yin seed and
[40:19] fruit sun and Sky Big Bang in continuous
[40:23] creation male and female direct Delta
[40:25] function and all there is um
[40:28] Consciousness and physics mind and
[40:30] matter all of those things all the same
[40:32] complements that are used as analoges
[40:35] for um modern wave particle
[40:38] duality um that this is a wonderful
[40:42] model of of
[40:44] everything by definition this isn't a
[40:47] jealous God of a petty people who says
[40:50] my God's bigger and better than your God
[40:51] because it's my God and it's the one God
[40:53] because I say so that's not what we're
[40:55] saying here I'm saying we are starting
[40:58] with the definition of Singularity and
[41:00] wholeness definitions are not the basis
[41:03] of prejudice it's a postulate putting it
[41:06] down to see how good it is doesn't give
[41:07] us
[41:08] anything and if we look for the means of
[41:11] spanning between the one and the many we
[41:14] have a path that includes everything in
[41:16] the
[41:16] universe now modern physics attempts a
[41:19] bottomup reconstruction take all the
[41:21] diversity we find all the forces in the
[41:23] world and pump the energy up until
[41:26] things merge together and eventually we
[41:28] can extrapolate and find the Big
[41:30] Bang the one from the many and I'm
[41:34] saying we can do this abstractly we can
[41:36] do this topologically in principle
[41:38] without any electron microscopes and
[41:41] cyclotrons and
[41:42] supercomputers we can start top down by
[41:45] definition start with a singularity
[41:47] break it up by minimal first distinction
[41:50] and end up with all there
[41:52] is and it's my guess and this is still a
[41:55] guess that one way or another another in
[41:58] an extraordinarily elegant way perhaps
[42:00] the most elegant possible that's what
[42:02] the sequence of letters in the Hebrew
[42:03] Bible really
[42:06] represents now how can there be a story
[42:08] on top of it well Hebrew doesn't come
[42:10] with vowels and it doesn't come
[42:12] originally with the letters broken up
[42:13] into words um according to rabic
[42:16] tradition this was in the Jerusalem Post
[42:18] about 15 years ago according to Rabbi
[42:20] Pinkus P there were over 900 acceptable
[42:23] translations to the first verse alone so
[42:26] there's depending on how you divide up
[42:28] the word the letters into words there's
[42:30] plenty of room to tell the story you
[42:31] want to tell there plenty of room for
[42:33] the
[42:34] translations now if you had a formal
[42:38] language we'll talk about this as a
[42:40] formal language that enabled you to
[42:42] record something very important like a
[42:45] particular meditation that led to an ego
[42:47] death and rebirth experience in a safe
[42:49] way and other things besides and you had
[42:52] to store that
[42:55] someplace you'd have to put a story on
[42:58] top of it because the first thing that
[43:00] happens in bad times is they kill all
[43:02] the priests and the Kings and and and
[43:04] the teachers it's only the peasants that
[43:06] survive so you have to give it meaning
[43:08] to people who don't have access to the
[43:10] deepest levels what better to do than to
[43:13] put the cultural history of that people
[43:15] as the clear text so they'll have
[43:17] allegiance to it so they'll want to
[43:18] remember it what better to do than to
[43:21] use known true history as best as you
[43:23] can know it and tell it why lie who's
[43:26] going to keep your your your text if
[43:28] you're live everybody knows you made it
[43:29] up no you picked stories
[43:32] already known to be true that's why the
[43:35] Hebrew Bible recapitulates stories that
[43:37] we know come from Sumer or Arad or other
[43:40] places in other cultures they were just
[43:42] trying to tell the truth it's a history
[43:45] book but the history book's the clear
[43:48] text arranged to be the history book
[43:51] because what's underneath needed to be
[43:53] preserved I'm saying that underneath the
[43:56] story could be a science of
[43:58] Consciousness a meditational set of
[44:01] exercises and and tools to go along with
[44:04] the
[44:04] exercises that enable an individual to
[44:08] have an ego death and rebirth experience
[44:10] an Enlightenment experience a peak
[44:12] experience that's integrative that's
[44:14] healthy healing um that is um as modern
[44:19] as is as it is ancient and by the way if
[44:22] we're looking at unifying things like
[44:25] Symmetry and asymmetry of highest con
[44:27] contr then of course if this model is
[44:30] what it claims to be it's not just a
[44:31] spatial model it's a temporal model it's
[44:34] intended to unify the past and the
[44:36] present and the future
[44:40] too there's a lot more to come I want to
[44:42] get through with one little section of
[44:44] this first though
[44:46] um so if we try to make the most
[44:49] asymmetrical spiral
[44:51] possible we discover that the one
[44:53] specified by The Credo of Judaism is the
[44:56] one to use use and if we bring it up
[45:00] into three
[45:02] dimensions as I'm going to show you how
[45:04] to do in a moment we end up with this
[45:06] little spiral and when we look at it
[45:09] from different
[45:10] directions we find all the letters of
[45:13] the western sacred
[45:14] alphabets and now with this
[45:17] understanding all of a sudden the word
[45:18] sacred is not just a
[45:19] vanity that's just not my saying my
[45:22] language is sacred because I'm bigger
[45:23] and better than you and it's my language
[45:25] therefore it's sacred no this is
[45:27] actually a meaningful designation it's
[45:29] sacred because you can use it to read
[45:30] and write
[45:31] meditations and it's sacred because you
[45:33] can use it as a base space to specify
[45:36] any Quantum State Factor now they didn't
[45:38] have quantum mechanics but they could
[45:40] have understood what I just said and
[45:42] maybe we'll get to that part too and
[45:44] it's also sacred because it becomes the
[45:46] basis of a natural universal
[45:49] language and I'm saying that what we've
[45:52] discovered here or what I'm about to
[45:53] tell you is the preow of Babel universal
[45:56] language alluded to in the Bible that
[45:58] it's not mysterious or miraculous it's
[46:00] obvious and in fact I don't know why the
[46:03] universe works this way um but the
[46:07] current issue of American
[46:09] scientist it's an
[46:12] article actually I shouldn't do this yet
[46:14] I want to do one other thing
[46:16] first people want to know why why I have
[46:18] this hat on and I'm keeping the Sabbath
[46:21] and keeping kosher if I'm obviously not
[46:24] really feeling like the kind of person
[46:25] that keeps rituals
[46:27] well I had this model and I couldn't
[46:30] figure out how to use it I was
[46:33] styed and I happened to show it to a
[46:35] rather impressive Orthodox Rabbi that
[46:37] was traveling in California and uh of
[46:40] course doing his job um my background
[46:42] being Jewish he had an obligation stand
[46:46] come on you're doing this work all these
[46:49] years you got to keep Koshi you got to
[46:51] keep the Sabbath you got to say the
[46:52] prayers it's only right you should do
[46:54] that don't be don't be a baby be a men
[46:57] take on the obligations stop messing
[47:00] around and I say of course I can't do
[47:02] that I don't believe in this stuff how
[47:03] can I do i' be a hypocrite that would be
[47:05] terrible but I thought about it and I
[47:07] thought about it and I realized that
[47:09] that wasn't the issue you know if you
[47:11] drink the Sweet Water of the Town well
[47:14] and I've been drinking this for 20 years
[47:16] by then um and you're a healthy mature
[47:19] person you don't quibble over the
[47:21] architecture of the well or who built it
[47:23] or who owns it you're dependent on it
[47:26] everyone's dependent on it you pitch in
[47:27] and take care of it that's what you do
[47:30] how do you pitch in and take care of a
[47:32] spiritual tradition you stand up for it
[47:35] you say I I I'll I'll join I'll be here
[47:38] I I'll be counted um Jesse Jackson says
[47:41] you can't just talk to talk you got to
[47:42] walk the walk so I said as a matter of
[47:46] respect I'm drinking this Sweet Water
[47:49] I'm building my my career on researching
[47:51] this um all right it's not such a big
[47:54] thing I can keep the Sabbath I can keep
[47:57] kosher they killed all the king crab
[47:58] already anyhow there's no more left to
[48:00] eat I don't have to eat crab anymore um
[48:03] I can do without without pork there's
[48:05] lots of good Jewish food substitutes
[48:07] it's not such a burden but you know this
[48:09] prayer stuff I can do that but you got
[48:13] to put on the Fillin when you say the
[48:14] prayers now the fillan Flory are those
[48:17] boxes that you put on your arm and your
[48:19] forehead you see in the newsreels people
[48:21] at at in Jerusalem wearing them Orthodox
[48:23] Jews and and I said Rabbi look this is
[48:27] embarrassing this is a ritual it's a box
[48:30] and a strap and you put it on you look
[48:33] funny and gee I go but you know you you
[48:38] can't back out right you got to play
[48:40] fair so um one night down in the
[48:44] basement and no one was looking I said
[48:46] okay I'm going to do it and so I'm
[48:49] sitting there and I'm putting this strap
[48:51] on my arm which is how you bind the the
[48:53] the case on now the thing about the fill
[48:55] in in the prayer is it follows
[48:57] immediately after the shma here o Israel
[48:59] the Lord Our God the Lord is one it's
[49:01] what follows naturally from that point
[49:04] you put your hand over your eye and you
[49:06] say the shma and then you read it and
[49:08] you've got the thein on and and and as
[49:11] you when the thein is on you wrap it on
[49:13] your hand the strap and on your hand
[49:15] you're supposed to see like letter Shin
[49:17] the letter dollet the letter yud in your
[49:19] hand in the strap in your hand in the
[49:23] St oh my God
[49:27] Instant Karma drop my ego
[49:30] defenses and
[49:32] bingo the little flame model is a model
[49:35] hand it's a model
[49:38] hand it's a one-third chunk of this
[49:40] apple of these Taurus models which if we
[49:43] get a chance we'll talk about but
[49:44] they're on most of the other tapes it's
[49:46] a hand and you know what about a hand
[49:49] like I was saying before we started the
[49:51] tape you can always see your hand in
[49:52] your mind's eye you can always see
[49:54] what's in your hand in your mind's eye
[49:56] you could reach behind you you could
[49:58] tell a salt shaker from an Apple from
[49:59] the
[50:01] fork most people can if you haven't had
[50:04] too much to drink the traffic cop is not
[50:05] going to have a you know you can do this
[50:07] you know where your nose is I don't have
[50:08] to have my eyes
[50:10] open so when you put the this is a
[50:13] thicker model um it's easier to see from
[50:17] the smaller
[50:20] models these are finger width those are
[50:22] hand width it's the same idea the edge
[50:24] of the curve is the same shape it just
[50:25] spread more
[50:28] when you put the flame in your
[50:31] hands oh by the way where's the
[50:33] tetrahedron anybody ever see the opening
[50:36] move two fists and two elbows the
[50:39] corners of the
[50:40] tetrahedron you put it in your hand you
[50:43] can immediately see it in your mind's
[50:45] eye takes a few minutes
[50:48] practice when you make different
[50:50] gestures with your own
[50:52] hands you see different outlines
[50:55] different shadows of the same
[50:59] model in fact you could see all the
[51:01] Hebrew letters and you know what each
[51:04] Hebrew letter has a
[51:06] name and the name of the letter pay the
[51:09] letter pay its name means mouth and you
[51:13] see it when you make this gesture that's
[51:16] the Hebrew letter pay now you'll see it
[51:18] in my left hand I'll see it in my right
[51:20] hand so it's a symmetrical
[51:23] set um this gesture produces the letter
[51:26] Zion anybody want to guess what Zion
[51:30] means how about
[51:32] project that's not a big
[51:35] secret if I were to spell Hebrew words
[51:38] using these
[51:40] gestures well you tell me what they mean
[51:43] um I'm Christopher Columbus I tell
[51:45] people and you're the American Indians
[51:47] and it says in the Diaries they spoke
[51:48] the American Indians in Hebrew and
[51:50] everyone thinks that's crazy except
[51:52] Mormons who believe that American
[51:53] Indians are the Lost
[51:55] tribes how could it be
[51:57] well the crew consisted of escaping
[52:00] Muslims and Jews they were escaping the
[52:03] Inquisition
[52:04] 1492 was
[52:07] when the Jews and the Muslims had to
[52:09] convert or be killed or driven out so
[52:12] the rich guys and the educated guys
[52:13] joined columbus' crew and said off why
[52:16] stay home it's going to be
[52:18] bad so they
[52:20] knew if I'm right these gestures the
[52:24] letter shapes I get match the handri
[52:26] writing that was used in Islamic
[52:30] Spain Rashi mcmanes is what it's
[52:34] called and if I'm Christopher Columbus
[52:36] and I ask you to get me something like
[52:38] this would someone like to say what a
[52:41] kind of thing I want an adjective maybe
[52:44] something that is anybody for the tape
[52:48] come on Apple is good round rounds
[52:53] obviously round yeah this is the Hebrew
[52:55] letter gimmel
[52:57] for those who know
[52:58] Hebrew and this is the Hebrew letter
[53:02] lamad that's the
[53:06] doorbell giml lamid spells round that's
[53:11] the root for the word round if I'm a
[53:15] traffic cop and I do
[53:18] this everyone knows I mean come towards
[53:20] me bait Olive lamid yud means come
[53:24] towards me
[53:26] now not everything's that simple I'm Pi
[53:28] picking examples that make the point
[53:31] obvious but I'm saying that the Hebrew
[53:34] and almost certainly the Greek and
[53:36] Arabic letters are based on hand
[53:38] gestures because hand gestures have
[53:40] natural meaning and I'm going to say
[53:42] that the natural me the meanings
[53:43] selected to be characterized by the
[53:45] letters were picked in a formal way to
[53:48] produce a complete system we might get
[53:50] to that I want to read a quotation now
[53:53] that I was about to read which I think
[53:55] makes the case now I've been saying this
[53:57] for about 8 years now I think since just
[54:00] about after we made the first tape here
[54:01] 10 years
[54:03] ago this is um in the current issue of
[54:05] the American scientist March April 1999
[54:08] gestural origins of language human
[54:10] language may have evolved from manual
[54:12] gestures which survive today as a
[54:14] behavioral fossil coupled to speech now
[54:17] this is a very long and very fine
[54:19] article and it's actually not the one
[54:20] that I first spotted This was um spotted
[54:22] for me by a friend but I'm going to read
[54:24] a a a subsection that's quoted in here
[54:27] from a paper that we got off the
[54:30] internet by asking the authors if we
[54:33] could have it this was announced in
[54:35] Scientific American last month and it's
[54:37] by Janna Iverson at Indiana University
[54:39] in Bloomington and Susan Goldwin Meadow
[54:42] University of Chicago Chicago why people
[54:45] gesture when they speak and I'm just
[54:46] going to excerpt a little um when people
[54:50] talk they gesture however individuals
[54:52] who were blind from birth never actually
[54:56] speakers moving their hands as they talk
[54:58] and thus have no model for
[55:01] gesturing here we show that congenitally
[55:04] blind
[55:05] speakers gesture despite their lack of a
[55:08] visual model even when speaking to a
[55:11] blind
[55:12] listener
[55:15] woo moreover the spontaneous hand
[55:18] movements that co-occur with speech are
[55:19] not
[55:21] random going further down we found that
[55:23] all 12 blind speakers gestured as they
[55:25] spoke to despite the fact that that they
[55:27] had never seen gesture the blind group
[55:29] gesture at a rate not reliably different
[55:30] from the cited group and conveyed the
[55:32] same information using the same range of
[55:34] gesture forms for example speakers both
[55:37] blind and
[55:39] sighted tilted a c-shaped hand in the
[55:42] air as though pouring liquid from a
[55:44] glass to indicate that a liquid had been
[55:46] transferred to a different
[55:48] container now if you look on the charts
[55:51] that I gave
[55:52] you hopefully if I can find my copy of
[55:56] them
[55:57] you'll find that there's a
[55:59] gesture for the letter
[56:02] doid which traditional meaning is door
[56:05] and which in operational meaning means
[56:07] to divide it literally means to pour out
[56:11] like what happens at a Delta the Greek
[56:13] letter where river divides dilates
[56:15] dilutes all DLT routs Delta doet
[56:20] dilute what when a river divides out as
[56:23] it meets the sea in a Delta it means to
[56:25] por out and the gesture that I show on
[56:29] the chart for making the letter dollet
[56:31] is
[56:32] this that's exactly the same one as
[56:35] these researchers just found was
[56:36] congenital and there's the letter
[56:42] dollet that doesn't prove that they're
[56:45] all the same but it proves that this is
[56:47] plausible and that there should be a
[56:48] range of gestures that could be
[56:51] universalized and that are quite natural
[56:53] and the idea of course is that there's
[56:55] an ENT Center in the brain that
[56:57] generates both gesture and speech and in
[57:00] fact the article in American scientist
[57:02] is discussing the possibility that
[57:05] speech came second that the original
[57:07] language was gestures and that it later
[57:10] developed into speech and so early
[57:13] humans would have gestured before they
[57:15] spoke um it's a very good article it's
[57:17] and it's quite complete and I I
[57:19] recommend it
[57:21] um so that's what we have here um we
[57:24] have a natural Universal gesture
[57:28] language turned into a formal
[57:31] system for recording and playing back
[57:34] meditational exercises which can become
[57:37] the true basis for a science of
[57:40] Consciousness which in modern terms
[57:43] becomes a
[57:44] religion um or several religions
[57:46] actually in fact that's also what this
[57:48] model talks about um let me see if I
[57:53] want I want to check my notes to make
[57:54] sure I haven't skipped anything
[57:55] important and then I want to go a little
[57:56] further here um a way to think about
[58:00] Hebrew since each letter has a name and
[58:02] meaning of its own is that words are
[58:05] sentences and we're dealing with an
[58:06] acronym language that you can read the
[58:09] meaning of Hebrew Roots letter by
[58:12] letter and as it turns out you more or
[58:15] less can now you don't get idiomatic
[58:17] meanings but you get a kind of
[58:19] operational set of meanings which
[58:21] underly the idiomatic meanings and which
[58:24] appear to be common to both the Hebrew
[58:25] and Arab Arabic names the names of the
[58:28] Arabic letters are associated with the
[58:30] attributes of Allah so they're in a
[58:31] slightly different context but if you go
[58:34] back to the operational meaning you get
[58:36] basically um the same
[58:40] system and the sets of meanings are
[58:42] based logically um I don't know how many
[58:45] of you know the works of Arthur M young
[58:46] the reflexive universe but he lays out
[58:50] a a model of process on the seven color
[58:54] map associated with the Taurus
[58:56] and I take his seven layers of process
[59:00] Universal topological process natural
[59:02] process self-organizing process and I
[59:04] embed them between Singularity and
[59:06] wholeness making nine and I do that in
[59:08] three levels so you get 27 meanings that
[59:12] produces a kind of Matrix of meaning and
[59:14] you can actually read it off off the
[59:16] little Rubik
[59:18] Cube um the first level is archetypal
[59:22] the second level is spiritual the third
[59:24] level is physical so the first letter
[59:27] Olive is all
[59:30] Consciousness the next letter the first
[59:33] letter of the next level yud hand is
[59:36] personal Consciousness we obviously
[59:38] going to talk more about that and the
[59:40] first letter of the third level level K
[59:42] which literally means monkey is monkey
[59:45] Consciousness mechanical thinking and
[59:47] the skull The Vessel for Consciousness
[59:50] and you can go through the whole set of
[59:52] the Alphabet letter by letter and those
[59:54] same rules hold as you go through the
[59:56] layers as you go across horizontally or
[59:59] vertically it's a true Matrix that lays
[01:00:02] out meaning now and I'm saying that in
[01:00:05] an abstract space the 27 letters
[01:00:09] probably can be shown to correspond
[01:00:11] meaningfully in the sense that Arthur
[01:00:13] Young produces a geometry of meaning
[01:00:16] from his
[01:00:18] metaphor um with the 27 lines to solve
[01:00:20] the general cubic
[01:00:22] equation which correspond to a set of 2
[01:00:26] seven well you can say they're like
[01:00:28] vectors coming off a hypersphere they're
[01:00:30] really not but it's it could be related
[01:00:32] so what you have is is is a
[01:00:34] hypersphere with a set of basic pointing
[01:00:37] directions coming off of it and because
[01:00:39] there's more symmetry variations in
[01:00:42] three and four dimensions than in higher
[01:00:43] Dimensions whatever is sufficient to
[01:00:45] navigate by these distinctions in four
[01:00:47] dimensions would be sufficient for any
[01:00:50] dimensionality so these 27 little unit
[01:00:52] vectors that correspond to these
[01:00:54] meanings of the letters should be
[01:00:56] sufficient to form a base space for any
[01:00:58] Quantum State Vector in Hilbert space
[01:01:01] now I don't know if that's true and
[01:01:03] someone who knows more physics than I do
[01:01:05] needs to work that out in detail but it
[01:01:07] seems highly likely that that that's the
[01:01:09] case particularly when you consider the
[01:01:12] possibility that the abrahamic and the
[01:01:15] brahic Traditions are actually related
[01:01:18] because in the brahic traditions we have
[01:01:20] the
[01:01:22] shantra the mandala of creation which I
[01:01:25] pulled out the three
[01:01:26] dimensions and it consists of nine
[01:01:28] interlac triangles which unfurl from a
[01:01:31] Bindu point a toal point into a
[01:01:35] hypersphere and of course nine triangles
[01:01:37] is 27
[01:01:38] lines so I'm saying that this shantra
[01:01:42] which occurs in a allegedly 3D form
[01:01:46] although it's usually not shown
[01:01:48] properly really is an early way of
[01:01:50] representing the 27 lines to solve the
[01:01:51] general cubic solve the general cubic
[01:01:54] equation did they know that in the ient
[01:01:56] world aren't I violating my what I said
[01:01:58] at the beginning this has to be known in
[01:02:00] the ancient world or I can't be right
[01:02:02] well it turns out that they did know it
[01:02:04] or it's likely they knew it um there is
[01:02:07] evidence on the Ry Papyrus from Egypt
[01:02:10] which is the oldest mathematical
[01:02:11] document we have I think of their
[01:02:13] ability to solve simple cubic equations
[01:02:15] in some special cases and that's
[01:02:18] described in a book on Egyptian
[01:02:20] mathematics um is it
[01:02:23] Gillings yeah I don't remember but if
[01:02:25] people I I can dig up the reference on
[01:02:27] that um it turns out that in term in
[01:02:29] order to make calendars you need to you
[01:02:31] need to know certain things and they
[01:02:33] made calendars and we don't know exactly
[01:02:36] what their formalisms were but they did
[01:02:38] work out some of these things in special
[01:02:40] cases so they could have understood this
[01:02:42] there's also a more direct way to get to
[01:02:44] it which I'm not going to show tonight
[01:02:47] um the same same with with this this um
[01:02:51] reciprocal spiral which shows up under
[01:02:54] the eye of Horus reciprocal spiral means
[01:02:57] it's it's based on one over everything
[01:02:59] well Egyptian fractions were all one
[01:03:01] over and so this is the spiral that you
[01:03:03] get from the table of Egyptian
[01:03:05] fractions which is very
[01:03:08] nice um and as I said earlier it can't
[01:03:11] be a logarithmic spiral because it a lot
[01:03:14] spirals too self-similar that includes
[01:03:16] the golden spiral it can't be um it
[01:03:19] can't be an archimedian spiral because
[01:03:21] it also has too much symmetry although
[01:03:23] it's cruder form um it has to be this
[01:03:27] spiral and if you examine this this
[01:03:29] spiral very carefully you find that it
[01:03:31] shows up in many different places some
[01:03:32] of them very unexpected it's the
[01:03:34] archetypal wind up and pitch of David
[01:03:38] and
[01:03:38] Goliath it's the flight path of a bird
[01:03:41] of prey from a tree in an oasis in a
[01:03:44] desert out over the out to the Horizon
[01:03:47] where it Dives on its prey bird of prey
[01:03:50] Lofts itself on the air currents and so
[01:03:52] it spirals up and then Dives um um and
[01:03:56] that's the same archetype but as I said
[01:03:59] um and that's a process and all the
[01:04:01] words in Hebrew that describe a bird of
[01:04:04] prey doing that including the word for
[01:04:05] desert and the word for the vortex and
[01:04:07] the word for the bird itself um and the
[01:04:09] word for the Horizon are all spelled
[01:04:11] with exactly the same letters I en R
[01:04:14] bait um but people will say well look
[01:04:18] Stan this how come we don't have any
[01:04:20] evidence of this why isn't there any
[01:04:22] archaeological remains why didn't they
[01:04:24] write it down
[01:04:26] well they did write it down and there
[01:04:29] shouldn't have been any archaeological
[01:04:31] remains
[01:04:33] um one there were rules against making
[01:04:35] idols and two if I'm right about it
[01:04:37] being a toilin strap toilin is made is a
[01:04:39] leather strap if you found it on the
[01:04:41] ground made of leather scrunched flat
[01:04:43] you wouldn't know what shape it was it
[01:04:45] piece of leather it's leather Dart
[01:04:47] that's all it looks like but it's been
[01:04:49] preserved and we've all seen it um the
[01:04:54] great mathematic I don't know who's a
[01:04:55] physicist mathematician physicist um
[01:04:58] durak proposed um an explanation for the
[01:05:02] reason that Fons like particles like
[01:05:04] electrons have spin of a half takes two
[01:05:06] times around for them to come back to
[01:05:08] the same location same direction he said
[01:05:11] that that this um was due to something
[01:05:15] which can't be called the direct string
[01:05:17] trick which d himself compared to the
[01:05:20] plate trick or the Philippine wine dance
[01:05:22] Philippine wine dance it's also known in
[01:05:25] the Middle East as the flame dance you
[01:05:27] put a candle in your palm and obviously
[01:05:29] you don't want to tip it over you put a
[01:05:30] glass of wine in your palm and obviously
[01:05:32] you don't want to tip it over the idea
[01:05:34] is that you want to go
[01:05:36] around continuously in the same
[01:05:38] direction by being going above and below
[01:05:40] your shoulder and um no I won't do it
[01:05:43] with the glass of water that would be
[01:05:45] foolish um well this is the Philippine
[01:05:48] wine
[01:05:49] dance well we've all seen the Cleopatra
[01:05:52] drawings it's not hard to believe that
[01:05:54] that's part of the same idea and we we
[01:05:55] of course know about Sufi dances and
[01:05:57] Middle Eastern dances and this is a kind
[01:05:59] of universal thing most cultures have
[01:06:02] it if you to actually look at the path
[01:06:06] of the
[01:06:08] dance I'm saying that this is the orbit
[01:06:10] of the
[01:06:13] dance well the cabala says this book of
[01:06:16] formation which no one can make sense of
[01:06:17] says put five against five and everyone
[01:06:20] knows the five means a hand and five
[01:06:23] against five would of course be
[01:06:26] like
[01:06:27] this it's simply two of the hand models
[01:06:30] a left and a right hand that's the orbit
[01:06:32] of the
[01:06:33] dance and of course the direct string
[01:06:36] trick got a lot of stuff here what the
[01:06:39] direct string trick says is that you
[01:06:41] have an outer sphere and an inner sphere
[01:06:43] and they're connected by a ribbon which
[01:06:46] I probably can't draw very well and that
[01:06:48] if
[01:06:50] you curl up the ribbon um I don't know
[01:06:54] if I can do it give it two turns and if
[01:06:56] it's stretchy what you can do is
[01:07:00] unstretch it by flopping it
[01:07:03] underneath and pulling it around and
[01:07:05] then it straightens out and that's why
[01:07:08] as you go around you do and undo the
[01:07:09] same
[01:07:11] curve you're connecting an insphere to
[01:07:14] an outs
[01:07:19] spere the 11th verse of Genesis says God
[01:07:23] created a fruit tree yielding fruit who
[01:07:25] seed is in
[01:07:29] itself this is a fruit and this is the
[01:07:32] womb or the seed it's a big apple no
[01:07:36] it's not New York City it's a big
[01:07:38] apple it's a big
[01:07:41] apple I'm taking a chunk out of this
[01:07:43] apple I'm pulling a serpent out of the
[01:07:46] Apple um on the Earth plane which is the
[01:07:50] equatorial plane of the Apple otherwise
[01:07:52] known as Eden and of course I've got 12
[01:07:55] fingers on the circle cuz I've got three
[01:07:58] hands in my model that comes from
[01:08:00] Genesis and we're going to not talk
[01:08:02] about that in detail so I've got 12
[01:08:04] fingers on the circle on the edge of the
[01:08:06] Earth plane 12 houses 12 Knights 12
[01:08:10] Apostles 12 tribes all the 12 round ones
[01:08:14] and I've got an upper and a lower and
[01:08:16] they rub against each other against a
[01:08:18] threshing floor where I could put grain
[01:08:20] down the
[01:08:21] middle Hamlet's
[01:08:23] Mill and in this this apple in the
[01:08:27] middle of the apple of course I have the
[01:08:29] seed and then if I'm going to map the
[01:08:31] life cycle of the fruit tree onto its
[01:08:33] own fruit fruit tree yielding fruit
[01:08:35] whose seed is in itself well if that's
[01:08:37] the seed the golden seed in the middle
[01:08:40] then this is the tree and this is the
[01:08:46] fruit a natural module of a living
[01:08:48] system and I can also map the stages of
[01:08:51] the whole alphabet onto this but we're
[01:08:52] not going to do that tonight now
[01:08:55] I think I actually have the quote
[01:08:58] here they tell us in the
[01:09:02] Bible not only that the Torah is a tree
[01:09:05] of life for those who grasp it grasp
[01:09:08] hold in the hands Tree of Life recursive
[01:09:12] hierarchy but they also tell
[01:09:16] us if I can find
[01:09:19] it I should redo that quote
[01:09:22] anyway Moses said this is a app pointing
[01:09:25] the Architects to build a tabernacle
[01:09:26] Moses said to the Israelites God has
[01:09:28] selected betel son of iie son of K the
[01:09:31] tribe of Judah and has filled them with
[01:09:33] Divine Spirit of wisdom understanding
[01:09:35] and knowledge and talent for all types
[01:09:37] of craftsmanship he will thus be able to
[01:09:40] devise plans and work in Gold Silver and
[01:09:43] copper and Etc also will eventually be
[01:09:46] able to brocade embroider and weave so
[01:09:49] I'm saying that it's not that the Torah
[01:09:52] is in the Tabernacle or in the ark it's
[01:09:54] that the ark is in the Torah woven in
[01:09:58] and I'm saying that this is the golden
[01:10:01] Point gold and silver and
[01:10:04] Brass the star Sun the Prophet The
[01:10:09] Temple
[01:10:10] mount the
[01:10:13] seed and this part the part in the palm
[01:10:17] of the hand is the silver part Hebrew
[01:10:20] word for silver it's the word for money
[01:10:22] KF cof cough means palm and saf is the
[01:10:26] insaf the Sophia the Sufi the whole
[01:10:31] model hold and the word for copper or
[01:10:35] brass and the word for serpent is the
[01:10:37] same so this is the snaky part this is
[01:10:40] the
[01:10:41] copper and together they form the whole
[01:10:46] system now I'm also going to point
[01:10:48] out that this is true of all whole
[01:10:51] systems at all levels this is the hero's
[01:10:53] journey this is the of the Earth plane
[01:10:56] the equatorial plane you descend to the
[01:10:58] depths and you fight your way back in
[01:10:59] seven sacred quests till you get home to
[01:11:01] the
[01:11:03] center it's a map of the external hero's
[01:11:07] journey and I'm going to suggest that
[01:11:09] that
[01:11:10] Quest that set of
[01:11:13] tests that tests one's ethical behavior
[01:11:16] in the world is in fact the external
[01:11:19] transformation of the meditation in the
[01:11:21] mind that the reason religious
[01:11:23] Traditions insist on ethical Behavior
[01:11:25] Thou shalt not mess up your
[01:11:28] neighbor is because that's how one
[01:11:31] externalizes what one experiences in the
[01:11:34] meditation and the other way around too
[01:11:36] people who have had ego death
[01:11:37] experiences come back humbled and more
[01:11:40] caring and more ecologically concerned
[01:11:43] and all of that more
[01:11:45] integrated their insides and their
[01:11:47] outsides are
[01:11:49] unified so this is the conceptual level
[01:11:53] clear thinking the seed
[01:11:57] this is the work
[01:11:59] level where the tree puts out a trunk
[01:12:02] and spreads its
[01:12:05] branches and the fruit is the
[01:12:10] result clear thinking hard work and what
[01:12:14] does a fruit do it drops from the tree
[01:12:16] it lets go and letting go clear thinking
[01:12:20] hard work and letting go that's the
[01:12:22] manifesting principle that's how you
[01:12:24] found your h your car or your husband or
[01:12:27] your wife you know what you want you
[01:12:30] work like crazy to find it and just at
[01:12:32] the point you've given up the realtor
[01:12:34] calls and says got a house for you or a
[01:12:38] wife or a car or whatever it is you're
[01:12:39] looking
[01:12:40] for well everything comes into the world
[01:12:42] that way whether you're conscious of it
[01:12:44] or not and you can read on the website
[01:12:46] something I call the three abrahamic
[01:12:47] Covenant and the car passing trick which
[01:12:50] tells you how you can use this principle
[01:12:51] to get by a slow driver without crossing
[01:12:54] the double yellow or getting a
[01:12:56] ticket and Cynthia will tell you she's
[01:12:58] actually seen police cars pull over Ed
[01:13:01] get out the cop get out of the car and
[01:13:02] shake his head why did I stop because
[01:13:04] nobody will pass a police car and you're
[01:13:06] really stuck going the speed limit if
[01:13:07] you come up behind the
[01:13:09] cop well it's not only the manifesting
[01:13:13] principle but it's the proper
[01:13:15] relationship among the three major
[01:13:18] components of the abrahamic faiths
[01:13:21] Judaism Christianity and
[01:13:23] Islam the seed clear thinking the
[01:13:26] Covenant of the law is the Jewish
[01:13:30] Covenant the tree the cross hard work
[01:13:34] passion and compassion
[01:13:36] Dharma that's the Christian Covenant and
[01:13:40] it's the fruit of
[01:13:42] Islam and that fruit Must Fall to the
[01:13:45] Earth let go Muslims let go submit to
[01:13:49] Allah yield up their
[01:13:51] egos when it falls the Earth and breaks
[01:13:54] open
[01:13:56] it becomes the fertile ground for the
[01:13:58] new seed so this model predicts that
[01:14:03] when everybody's gotten it all out of
[01:14:04] their
[01:14:06] system it's the Muslims who are going to
[01:14:08] rebuild the Temple and they're going to
[01:14:10] take pride in being the custodians for
[01:14:13] the Jews and the
[01:14:15] Christians the Muslim ideal is
[01:14:17] Hospitality that's what they admire in
[01:14:22] Abraham and they see them themselves
[01:14:24] they call themselves it's the fruit of
[01:14:26] Islam that's their
[01:14:29] place and so they're going to take pride
[01:14:31] in being the guarant guarantors of the
[01:14:34] system instead of
[01:14:37] adversaries and the Christian tradition
[01:14:39] understands it's the link between the
[01:14:41] two and its place in the world is pretty
[01:14:44] well known and the Jews are not going to
[01:14:46] be upset with the situation because
[01:14:49] they'll recognize their place in the
[01:14:51] body
[01:14:52] politic just like all the letters are
[01:14:55] different perspectives of this same
[01:14:57] model of the hand of God because after
[01:15:01] all when I make gestures and my ego
[01:15:04] isn't there the gestures are the
[01:15:05] gestures of God they're not coming from
[01:15:10] me just like the letters are different
[01:15:13] perspectives on the same
[01:15:16] model the organs in our body are
[01:15:18] different projections of the same common
[01:15:20] DNA my heart and liver appear to be
[01:15:23] different they worship in different ways
[01:15:25] they have different
[01:15:27] religions but if they go inside they
[01:15:30] find the same Common Core you go inside
[01:15:32] the different vessels and you find the
[01:15:34] same light when you're climbing a holy
[01:15:37] mountain on the Earth plane everything
[01:15:40] is diverse as possible things are all
[01:15:41] spread out they are many but as you
[01:15:44] approach the peak all the paths
[01:15:47] Converge All the pads converge this is
[01:15:51] actually the model you get you get um
[01:15:53] three hands above and three hands below
[01:15:55] it's a 310 Taurus knot and the center
[01:15:57] column has the same twist as Bucky
[01:16:00] Fuller's model of DNA if you stack up 99
[01:16:03] tetrahedra and if you circumcise this
[01:16:05] column by slitting it and pulling it
[01:16:07] around you get this outline of an apple
[01:16:10] with a tree with a
[01:16:14] seed and so I'm saying that that's the
[01:16:16] basic model and it it produces a set of
[01:16:18] six hands around the center point those
[01:16:20] are the six days around the Sabbath The
[01:16:22] Still Point in the middle this is the
[01:16:24] Temple mount this is the Temple
[01:16:27] Mount um and it's a whole
[01:16:31] system and so if each of these Western
[01:16:34] Traditions goes deep into
[01:16:37] itself not listening to any of the
[01:16:39] others doing its own thing as best it
[01:16:43] can it'll come to a common core and
[01:16:46] realize it's part of a bigger body
[01:16:48] politic and my heart my liver and my
[01:16:50] lungs had better learn to get along with
[01:16:51] each other or I'm not going to last very
[01:16:53] long this is an ecological model it says
[01:16:55] that every people every nation has a
[01:16:58] vital contribution to make we haven't
[01:17:00] got any appendices or
[01:17:02] fingernails everybody here has a right
[01:17:04] to be here and has a place and if they
[01:17:06] go deep into themselves or their own
[01:17:07] Traditions they're going to find
[01:17:09] something like the same model it's a
[01:17:11] truly Universal model and there are many
[01:17:14] reasons to believe that um I want to
[01:17:17] back away because this is getting
[01:17:18] awfully heavy and do something a little
[01:17:20] more experiential then I want to check
[01:17:23] my notes and and I want to um allow time
[01:17:27] for questions and for you to hear the
[01:17:28] music a bit so let's all go to the model
[01:17:32] in your pack and I'm going to take a
[01:17:35] different one and you can do this at
[01:17:38] home
[01:17:39] later what you want to do
[01:17:42] is this is how you square the circle you
[01:17:45] can read the the details in the blur
[01:17:47] with a straight edge in a compass a
[01:17:48] circle made by a compass and a straight
[01:17:51] Ed and a line made by a straight edge
[01:17:55] and um we're going to Simply cut them
[01:17:57] out and fold them
[01:18:01] up hopefully I can do this fairly
[01:18:03] rapidly I want to do it from scratch so
[01:18:06] I can show you how to fold it up and so
[01:18:07] I'm not going to make this one as pretty
[01:18:09] as I
[01:18:11] might fact I'm doing a terrible
[01:18:15] job take more time than I'm
[01:18:19] taking the idea is in the ancient world
[01:18:23] the most important
[01:18:26] riddle was how do you square a circle
[01:18:28] with a straight edge and a compass and
[01:18:31] there are Scholars who think that the
[01:18:33] Ancients were dumb and didn't know you
[01:18:35] couldn't do it and there's a few
[01:18:37] minority Scholars who believe that they
[01:18:39] knew you couldn't do it and they were
[01:18:40] talking about it because they were
[01:18:41] pointing to something more subtle and I
[01:18:44] have some references that say
[01:18:47] both and um before I do this I want to
[01:18:50] show you that it isn't as if they didn't
[01:18:52] leave us any record of this it isn't as
[01:18:54] if this isn't
[01:18:55] described the problem is that we have in
[01:18:58] our time only certain Scholars who look
[01:19:02] at this stuff and they're all Scholars
[01:19:04] of the bell arts and letters literary
[01:19:06] Scholars not scientists not geometers
[01:19:09] they don't recognize geonetric metaphor
[01:19:11] and even if they noticed it they
[01:19:12] wouldn't know what its purpose was why
[01:19:14] is it important who
[01:19:16] cares but people in the ancient world
[01:19:18] weren't literate their big thing wasn't
[01:19:20] the story they were Crafts People they
[01:19:23] worked with their hands they naturally
[01:19:25] recognize geometric metaphor any
[01:19:28] housewife
[01:19:29] who braids a holla holla bread for the
[01:19:33] Sabbath or weaves um
[01:19:36] clothing or is a is a carpenter I think
[01:19:39] there's a good reason why um Christians
[01:19:41] believe that Jesus was a carpenter he
[01:19:42] worked with his
[01:19:44] hands well people who do those sort of
[01:19:47] things recognize metaphors is based on
[01:19:49] using your hands and there's no
[01:19:52] necessity for very high level G here
[01:19:55] we're talking about the fact that a
[01:19:56] farmer knows that two-legged stools fall
[01:19:59] over and three-legged stools stand up
[01:20:02] otherwise you can't milk bossy at least
[01:20:04] it gets to be a terrible mess um let me
[01:20:07] read you a couple of quotes and I think
[01:20:09] they're in your packs so maybe I can
[01:20:11] find them
[01:20:16] there here they are I'm going to read
[01:20:19] the uh the second one the third one um
[01:20:22] this is from the origin of letters and
[01:20:24] numerals according to the sepher by
[01:20:25] Phineas mordell 1914 it's available from
[01:20:28] Sam Weiser copyright
[01:20:30] 75 um the references are there
[01:20:35] um we must conclude that the so-called
[01:20:37] Arabic numerals and the alphabet
[01:20:39] originated from the 10 digits and the
[01:20:41] zero or rather from two symbols one and
[01:20:43] zero the stroke and the circle nelm in
[01:20:45] his essay on the origin of letters shows
[01:20:48] that all elementary characters or
[01:20:49] letters derive their forms from line and
[01:20:51] circle as I understand the seater it
[01:20:53] also holds that all written characters
[01:20:55] originated from a line in a circle but
[01:20:57] from a line that was originally a symbol
[01:20:59] for
[01:21:00] Unity and a circle that was originally a
[01:21:02] symbol for zero he's wrong it's actually
[01:21:04] homeless similarly well we don't have to
[01:21:07] go on look anybody reading that any
[01:21:10] literate person would say gee gosh wishz
[01:21:14] that's pretty obvious all the letters
[01:21:16] are made up of straight lines and
[01:21:18] arcs and leave it at
[01:21:21] that isn't that the natural obvious
[01:21:23] meaning of the quote a line in a circle
[01:21:26] you look at letters they have straight
[01:21:28] parts and they have curved Parts it
[01:21:31] isn't as if they didn't write it down
[01:21:33] it's that the people doing the
[01:21:34] interpreting and translating for us
[01:21:37] didn't notice or look for or think there
[01:21:40] ought to be a deeper meaning and they
[01:21:42] didn't look for a deeper meaning because
[01:21:44] they presumed that the folks from the
[01:21:46] ancient world weren't very bright or
[01:21:49] knowledgeable they were simple enough to
[01:21:51] think that that was an important
[01:21:52] statement not an obvious statement
[01:21:55] and I'm saying the solution is much
[01:21:57] nicer the reason for posing the riddle
[01:22:00] wasn't because the Greeks didn't know
[01:22:02] you couldn't Square the circle with a
[01:22:03] straight AG in a compass it's because
[01:22:05] they did know that you couldn't do it
[01:22:08] geometrically but that thinking about it
[01:22:12] philosophically recorded the fact that
[01:22:15] universal language is hand gesture
[01:22:17] language because when you take your
[01:22:19] circle and your
[01:22:21] line and you curl them up rather tightly
[01:22:25] curl up the circle if you've cut it out
[01:22:28] you can do this and you have to over
[01:22:30] curl it so when it snaps back it holds
[01:22:31] its
[01:22:32] shape and if you bend up the
[01:22:38] line
[01:22:42] voila now I made some prettier ones
[01:22:45] earlier and we only have a couple more
[01:22:47] of these kits around um and of course
[01:22:49] they've unsprung themselves a little in
[01:22:52] transit but they're not bad
[01:22:56] that's the that's the answer to the
[01:22:57] riddle it's a model hand that generates
[01:23:02] the sacred letters of the western
[01:23:05] alphabets that you need if you're going
[01:23:07] to learn the meditation or make use of
[01:23:11] them for their cosmological models it's
[01:23:13] as simple as that this is the same
[01:23:16] model as as this is it's a little bigger
[01:23:19] I think it's got approximately one and a
[01:23:23] half turns
[01:23:25] you know you made it right when it comes
[01:23:26] to about the same level and the two are
[01:23:28] approximately
[01:23:30] parallel and you can make various
[01:23:33] gestures that make the letters with it
[01:23:34] so cut it out carefully and cut it out
[01:23:36] from the side with a sharp design so you
[01:23:38] get the right outline and bend it gently
[01:23:41] so it doesn't crimp and you'll be able
[01:23:43] to make Pair of
[01:23:48] Hands and I'm saying that this is the
[01:23:50] solution to squaring the circle and
[01:23:52] reconciling the idea of the one and the
[01:23:53] many
[01:23:55] and as a model of the four-letter name
[01:23:58] of God and the felet name of God I've
[01:24:00] got lots more detail here we can go into
[01:24:02] the Symmetry groups and the Taurus knots
[01:24:04] I can show you why tetrahedr and
[01:24:06] Tauruses go together um we can unfurl
[01:24:09] some of the forms they didn't need any
[01:24:11] of the GE any of the formal geometry you
[01:24:13] could do it by stacking oranges in the
[01:24:15] Agora you know how you stack fruit in
[01:24:17] the marketplace well that's cuac the
[01:24:19] hedral sphere packing it turns out that
[01:24:21] cuac the hedral sphere packs can be used
[01:24:23] to lay out the same forms the same
[01:24:26] Vortex forms very
[01:24:28] elegantly um if you didn't get the curve
[01:24:31] from what I just said and you happen to
[01:24:34] worship the sun god Helios sun in the
[01:24:37] center of the Earth plane going around
[01:24:40] all that stuff the Plato's Cave Helios
[01:24:43] the sun
[01:24:45] god well it's very convenient if you
[01:24:49] take a um Sund dial and you mark a spot
[01:24:53] at the same time every day that's the
[01:24:56] curve you
[01:24:58] get Helios draws his own curve
[01:25:02] experimentally to a person who would
[01:25:04] have common knowledge of how to make a
[01:25:06] Sund dial in the ancient
[01:25:07] world no analytic forms required now um
[01:25:11] I spent a lot of time trying to figure
[01:25:14] out how to shape the
[01:25:17] cone to get the right kind of
[01:25:20] Vortex well if you assemble six of these
[01:25:24] hand models obviously I made the wrong
[01:25:26] handedness let's take the other
[01:25:30] one six of the same kind these are
[01:25:33] identical now I could put the rest of
[01:25:35] the fingers in and you'd have a full
[01:25:38] basket and if you were to lay out the
[01:25:40] letter skip patterns in you write the
[01:25:42] Torah on this the letter skip patterns
[01:25:44] would form concentric bands just like
[01:25:46] stripes on a Navajo rug so they didn't
[01:25:48] have to do any heavy duty math to code
[01:25:49] the text coding it was simply a matter
[01:25:51] of looking at it to checking it anyway
[01:25:54] um oh another interesting point is you
[01:25:56] know how they wrote codes in the ancient
[01:25:57] world kept secret codes one of the most
[01:25:59] common
[01:26:00] ways General a would send a message to
[01:26:03] General B by taking a strap and winding
[01:26:06] it on a pole and writing across the
[01:26:08] windings and if general b knew the
[01:26:10] diameter of the pole and general a only
[01:26:13] sent the limp strap with a lot of
[01:26:15] miscellaneous stuff filled in the only
[01:26:17] way you could read the message was to
[01:26:18] wind it on the same pole and the second
[01:26:20] General would get the message well
[01:26:23] that's how you see the patterning in the
[01:26:25] first verse of
[01:26:27] Genesis these are the Symmetry groups
[01:26:29] showing the letters a a b a as I told
[01:26:31] you early on a a b a a a b
[01:26:36] a so that this was a form of coding that
[01:26:39] was known in the ancient world and used
[01:26:42] but they didn't wind it just on on a
[01:26:43] straight pole I think they wound it on
[01:26:46] this special
[01:26:48] scepter dorge comes to mind in the
[01:26:51] Eastern
[01:26:52] Traditions um this kiddish cup if the
[01:26:56] all if it had all these spheres packed
[01:26:57] in it they'd be like
[01:27:01] grapes so we have our wine cup we have
[01:27:04] our Grail cup um yes it comes with
[01:27:07] Excalibur right inside of
[01:27:09] it see its Center column is a
[01:27:12] scalibur and if you pull this out and
[01:27:14] flip it around you get the levite sword
[01:27:17] dance very similar to some Sufi dances
[01:27:19] in modern sword dancing which I'm not
[01:27:21] going to demonstrate
[01:27:24] um and the unit turn of this column this
[01:27:27] is 1/3 unit turn has exactly enough room
[01:27:30] for one letter each of the 22 letter
[01:27:32] Hebrew alphabet and turning it inside
[01:27:34] out into this 3D form leaves room for
[01:27:36] the other five final letters for the 27l
[01:27:39] alphabet so they inter transform like a
[01:27:41] GL like a gluon and an event in super
[01:27:44] String Theory now did they know super
[01:27:47] String Theory absolutely not did they
[01:27:49] knew this basic topology from braiding
[01:27:51] hollas for the Sabbath and milking cows
[01:27:53] yes
[01:27:56] did and they could have checked it in
[01:27:58] meditation instead of at the cyclotron
[01:28:01] so they had a way to test it and they
[01:28:03] had an experimental science based on
[01:28:04] musical harmonies which parallel the
[01:28:07] geometries if you're into the music I
[01:28:09] highly recommend um the work of Ernest G
[01:28:12] mlan who's a former chair of Music at
[01:28:15] Brooklyn College now retired who's
[01:28:17] written several really brilliant books
[01:28:19] showing tonal mandalas that are
[01:28:21] associated with Hebrew Greek and Arabic
[01:28:23] texts
[01:28:24] and Eastern viic material as well
[01:28:27] brilliant material these are 16 carpet
[01:28:32] pages from the Leningrad codex which is
[01:28:35] the oldest Hebrew Bible in existence
[01:28:38] it's a thousand years old it was taken
[01:28:40] from the from Cairo and end up ended up
[01:28:43] at the Hermitage in St Petersburg long
[01:28:46] story you will notice that they are
[01:28:48] highly
[01:28:50] geometric in fact those who know some
[01:28:53] Physics who recognize the baronian
[01:28:55] Rings which invert to produce hyperbolic
[01:28:58] space you'll also notice um various
[01:29:01] Taurus knots and pre- cabalistic
[01:29:03] drawings and of course the academic
[01:29:06] Scholars treat this as nothing but
[01:29:08] artistic embellishment and have never
[01:29:09] even looked at this sitting there in
[01:29:12] front of them and they've never even
[01:29:13] thought it was anything other than
[01:29:14] Artistry so I would suggest there's a
[01:29:16] lot more to do to find out what all that
[01:29:19] means um okay I'm going to stop um we
[01:29:22] have the music and um why don't I take
[01:29:25] some questions first thank you that
[01:29:30] was so you're now A True Believer and
[01:29:33] we're all going to go out and have a
[01:29:34] Revival meeting right got
[01:29:38] questions just brief
[01:29:41] on I was doing some reading for lecture
[01:29:44] I to give I
[01:29:47] did cultism and was reading about uh pic
[01:29:53] and Roy and Georgy is
[01:29:57] Renaissance yeah particularly Georg
[01:30:00] Russia um Renaissance cabalists but they
[01:30:03] were Christian cabalists right working
[01:30:05] with derivative versions that have been
[01:30:07] externalized but but let me say um
[01:30:10] during the pre-christian the Islamic
[01:30:13] period in Spain there is considerable
[01:30:15] evidence that Jewish and Christian and
[01:30:17] Muslim researchers worked together very
[01:30:19] closely and knew and appreciated each
[01:30:20] other's material and translated for each
[01:30:22] other
[01:30:24] be you that wouldn't be surprising that
[01:30:26] it would be surprising but great yeah it
[01:30:28] is it was um but I'm wondering if you've
[01:30:31] done anything if you've explored um
[01:30:34] whether there are any interesting
[01:30:35] resonances or implications with the
[01:30:38] insertion of uh is it Shin yeah uh into
[01:30:42] the middle of the
[01:30:44] gria I mean into the four-letter name to
[01:30:47] give the name of Jesus uh yeah um what
[01:30:51] what that does in terms of the
[01:30:53] symmetries or sequences because their
[01:30:55] claim of course was that this was
[01:30:57] something signicant yeah I've seen that
[01:31:00] um well one can play with that and there
[01:31:03] is geometric metaphor associated with it
[01:31:06] but um I guess since you've asked I
[01:31:08] should tell you what my take on the
[01:31:10] Christian story is because this reflects
[01:31:12] on it um in terms of Muslim tradition
[01:31:16] this is a model of Muhammad's Night
[01:31:18] Flight to Jerusalem he rides the steeve
[01:31:21] Barack his horse is named Barack Barack
[01:31:24] is mistranslated as Emerald as in the
[01:31:27] Emerald Tablet which is what this is
[01:31:29] also describing the Barack actually
[01:31:31] means lightning bolt this is the
[01:31:33] lightning bolt this is the Temple Mount
[01:31:35] this is the path of the Night
[01:31:37] Flight in the Christian
[01:31:40] tradition every one of the geometric
[01:31:43] attributes of the model maps on to the
[01:31:46] Christian Story the locations or the
[01:31:48] people involved the center point is
[01:31:51] obviously Jesus
[01:31:54] the whole shaded area is the manger but
[01:31:57] it's also the supper table the Passover
[01:32:00] table with the 12 apostles around it um
[01:32:03] in Hebrew the word for Tower is
[01:32:06] migdal um this is the tower in the
[01:32:08] middle um this is Mary Magdalene she
[01:32:12] connects between Jesus and the apostles
[01:32:15] she is in some people's Renditions some
[01:32:16] sort of holy prostitute that's because
[01:32:19] she has a male aspect and a female
[01:32:21] aspect and connects
[01:32:22] between um the whole
[01:32:25] form is golgatha the Skull and the
[01:32:28] homunculus of the hand fits right over
[01:32:30] and this becomes the spinal column and
[01:32:32] this becomes the side of the motor
[01:32:33] cortex that controls speech and hand
[01:32:35] motion so this is golgatha the the skull
[01:32:39] um I have a more detailed model that
[01:32:41] shows um the Mari the rivers that
[01:32:44] perform a womb for the figure
[01:32:47] inside um and what I'm
[01:32:50] saying is that what Jesus did was
[01:32:54] essentially the same thing as Rabbi
[01:32:57] akba story of Rabbi
[01:32:59] akba is that he and three companions did
[01:33:03] the meditation nobody knows where it is
[01:33:06] or what it is I'm saying the only place
[01:33:08] in Orthodox Rabbi would look for a
[01:33:10] meditation if they didn't want to get
[01:33:12] hit by fire from heaven would be in the
[01:33:16] Torah otherwise it's
[01:33:19] lost so what akba does is he does the
[01:33:22] meditation and he goes to part days to
[01:33:24] the orchard Paradise is the English word
[01:33:27] par days Garden of Eden is considered to
[01:33:30] be paradise pares pares is an acronym
[01:33:33] for four levels in Torah study the pay
[01:33:36] means the simple meaning the R means
[01:33:38] hints the dollet d means um discussion
[01:33:41] and S at the end means is s is the
[01:33:44] foundation your s sod
[01:33:47] s on the calistic level a person who can
[01:33:51] go through all four levels who can hold
[01:33:54] the whole text in their mind like
[01:33:55] tuscanini could hold a symphony in his
[01:33:57] mind or Mozart could generate one all as
[01:34:00] a unit can do the meditation the first
[01:34:03] meditator um died in the meditation
[01:34:05] didn't come out of it was too wonderful
[01:34:07] didn't come back the second guy comes
[01:34:09] back with Space Case Basket Case can't
[01:34:12] function at all out of it third guy Aker
[01:34:15] the
[01:34:16] other sometimes compared to Jesus in
[01:34:19] Jewish tradition under some conditions
[01:34:22] comes back with his mind intact but he
[01:34:24] um no longer is open to Jewish
[01:34:27] spirituality he goes his own way uh and
[01:34:31] Rabbi akba is the only person who enters
[01:34:33] whole and balanced and therefore comes
[01:34:36] out whole and balanced don't enter
[01:34:38] Chapel perilous with weapons we saw it
[01:34:41] in in in Star Wars you don't go to this
[01:34:44] place defended so if you enter and
[01:34:47] balance it in peace you can do the trip
[01:34:50] excuse me and come out of
[01:34:52] it um Akiba eventually
[01:34:56] designates Ben casba as Baraka son of
[01:34:59] the star Ben casba is a Jewish General
[01:35:01] fighting the Romans um the star we're
[01:35:04] talking about is this point in the
[01:35:06] center the Temple mount the Avatar the
[01:35:09] Messiah and he appoints Ben c as Baraka
[01:35:14] the Jewish Messiah who in the story in
[01:35:16] Judaism is killed by the Romans end of
[01:35:19] story um I already have Ken thanks thank
[01:35:22] you though
[01:35:29] um the story of Jesus is the same story
[01:35:33] it was Constantine that deified Jesus
[01:35:36] Jesus is in my opinion a rabbi who was
[01:35:39] an avatar who could do the
[01:35:41] meditation um and who um because he
[01:35:44] taught in his own name offended the
[01:35:46] rabbis and was sent away but basically
[01:35:49] was teaching the same thing um I don't
[01:35:51] think Jesus was asking for worship he
[01:35:53] was asking people to follow his path
[01:35:56] well the path is the meditation is the
[01:35:58] hero's
[01:35:59] journey it's the path that Moses is said
[01:36:02] to have written
[01:36:03] down it's where akba obviously looked
[01:36:06] it's the path that Muhammad followed
[01:36:08] followed on Barack to the Temple Mount
[01:36:11] it's the same thing what we're what I'm
[01:36:14] saying is if you read through the
[01:36:15] Christian Bible you find descriptions of
[01:36:18] the same geometric metaphor if you read
[01:36:20] through the Quan you find it you find it
[01:36:22] in room's description of the mevi Sufi
[01:36:24] round dance you find it in the
[01:36:26] discussion uh descriptions of the
[01:36:28] Emerald Tablet of Hermes trism Magisto
[01:36:31] Hermes is hyam hyam built the temple for
[01:36:33] Solomon According to some
[01:36:36] people um you find it in the Grail
[01:36:40] Legends you only see the Grail when
[01:36:42] you're particular State of Consciousness
[01:36:44] you only see the ark when you're in a
[01:36:45] particular State of Consciousness we're
[01:36:47] talking about the same model it's a
[01:36:49] model of ego death Moses is said to have
[01:36:54] merited receiving the Torah because he
[01:36:56] was the humblest of all people why was
[01:36:59] he the humblest of all people well
[01:37:01] compared to the
[01:37:03] Infinity of God everybody is infinitely
[01:37:06] humble because by definition this is an
[01:37:09] infinitely potent
[01:37:12] Point same is true of a teacher like
[01:37:15] Jesus whose main characteristics were
[01:37:18] this completely open compassion he let
[01:37:20] him you know turn the other cheek be
[01:37:22] totally humble the reason Moses beats
[01:37:25] Pharaoh is very very
[01:37:27] interesting pharaoh and Moses had the
[01:37:29] same education about the world they knew
[01:37:32] all the magic all the high teachings all
[01:37:34] the Priestly teachings of Egypt that's
[01:37:37] all I don't know where I have it here
[01:37:39] anymore um that's all Elohim that's all
[01:37:42] the felter name that's all external in
[01:37:45] the world they had the
[01:37:47] Sciences but Moses recognized the one
[01:37:50] God and was infinitely humble well
[01:37:53] Pharaoh didn't and acted on his own
[01:37:58] valtion and therefore Pharaoh loses and
[01:38:01] Moses wins and so this is a matter of an
[01:38:04] ego death a humil humbling not humility
[01:38:07] a humbling experience an akba is killed
[01:38:10] by the Romans by being skinned
[01:38:13] alive about a thousand years later in
[01:38:16] the court of James the 1 of
[01:38:19] Aragon uh a disputation is ordered by
[01:38:21] the holy Inquisition they pit Pablo
[01:38:24] christiani against nak manes the
[01:38:26] cabalist and leader of the Jewish
[01:38:29] Community um nak Mones is forced to
[01:38:32] admit that the tment says that the
[01:38:34] Messiah is going to be born when the
[01:38:35] Temple's
[01:38:37] destroyed and so christiani asked them
[01:38:40] well what's your problem with Jesus the
[01:38:42] temple was destroyed there's this guy he
[01:38:44] did this what's your problem and lmani
[01:38:48] says a person doesn't act in the world
[01:38:49] when they're
[01:38:51] born so Christianity says well where has
[01:38:53] he been waiting all this time where's
[01:38:55] your
[01:38:56] Messiah and nak Mani says he's in Gan
[01:39:00] aen in par days in the
[01:39:04] meditation each of us reaches the
[01:39:07] greeter the anthromorph isation of the
[01:39:10] Messiah in our own ego death
[01:39:14] experience perhaps in meditation perhaps
[01:39:18] by psychedelics or by yoga perhaps by
[01:39:20] trauma
[01:39:24] and we come back healed and
[01:39:27] whole um surely that's a valid basis for
[01:39:31] a whole range of spiritual
[01:39:34] traditions and I'm saying that something
[01:39:36] like this is what's going on here all
[01:39:39] right there are a lot of other questions
[01:39:40] uh but um I W take from the sign will
[01:39:43] you yes no no Nathaniel okay uh the r
[01:39:47] the C yeah that sounds also like the
[01:39:52] sounds like this yeah right it looks
[01:39:54] rather like a circle and a straight line
[01:39:57] yes have you tried making a uh hand from
[01:39:59] uh cutting that out the the r Theta
[01:40:02] curve produces the original
[01:40:04] model the simplified one is the circle
[01:40:06] in line and when you make the annular
[01:40:10] ring when you make this ring one/ third
[01:40:12] of the radius there's room for the other
[01:40:14] two and they naturally make this cup now
[01:40:18] you know again this is very thank you
[01:40:20] for asking that in the ancient world we
[01:40:22] assume they didn't have have analytic
[01:40:24] geometry they didn't have algebraic
[01:40:26] functions how do they know how to make
[01:40:28] that curve well they made it by a
[01:40:30] construction I wish I had a string that
[01:40:32] I could use that was loose but let's say
[01:40:35] you had a
[01:40:36] stick sitting on the desert floor and
[01:40:40] you had a string connected to one Edge
[01:40:42] and you walked perpendicular and pulled
[01:40:44] it something like this let me draw it on
[01:40:48] the
[01:40:52] board uh um we don't need this guy
[01:41:00] anymore here's your
[01:41:05] stick sitting on the
[01:41:09] origin and here you are and here's a
[01:41:11] string and you're going to pull it this
[01:41:12] way and so you start pulling this point
[01:41:14] out what you're going to find
[01:41:17] is this sort of
[01:41:22] thing right right it's called a tractrix
[01:41:26] as you well know if you rotate a
[01:41:28] tractrix to produce a
[01:41:32] surface both sides of the origin you get
[01:41:36] a pseudo EU or UE EU
[01:41:41] pseudo
[01:41:42] sphere a sphere is a surface of constant
[01:41:45] positive curvature everything is always
[01:41:47] a positive radial distance from the
[01:41:49] center the pseudosphere is a curve of
[01:41:52] con negative curvature it's inverse
[01:41:56] we're talking about relating inverses at
[01:41:58] every stage here embryology proceeds by
[01:42:01] invagination turning inside out between
[01:42:05] stages of growth and this is also the
[01:42:07] embryonic spiral it matches the shape of
[01:42:10] an embryo so by simply pulling a stick
[01:42:14] in the sand you generate that shape the
[01:42:18] way I make this
[01:42:20] curve by pulling this guy up up and
[01:42:23] letting it rotate at the same
[01:42:25] time naturally makes the pseudosphere
[01:42:28] outline solving a riddle that had made
[01:42:30] me crazy for a long time how did they
[01:42:32] know how to make the cone shape and
[01:42:33] what's the correct
[01:42:35] shape would you expect and have you
[01:42:37] looked for similar mathematical coding
[01:42:39] in new bet no I haven't and it and
[01:42:42] someone should and I don't know if you
[01:42:44] were here earlier but um
[01:42:47] shantra it should be there um I think
[01:42:50] the bramic and abrahamic pads are had a
[01:42:52] common origin or at least had a lot of
[01:42:55] cross
[01:42:55] fertilization and that the Eastern
[01:42:57] systems are going to turn out to be
[01:42:58] compliments and Toto to the Western
[01:43:00] systems and so also American Indian and
[01:43:05] um indigenous religions all over the
[01:43:07] world everybody dances around the
[01:43:09] campfire dances around the
[01:43:12] campfire dances around the campfire
[01:43:15] everyone does these things I'm saying
[01:43:17] that this is a model of a general
[01:43:20] projective principle naturally linked
[01:43:23] ing Consciousness in physics and as a
[01:43:25] principle whose shape is dependent on
[01:43:27] this basic geometry and
[01:43:29] topology it's Universal and can be
[01:43:32] embodied in any form as I quoted from
[01:43:35] Spencer Brown any form so Dolphins don't
[01:43:38] have hands but they're self-aware we
[01:43:40] think they'd use acoustic pressure waves
[01:43:43] to point to their solar plexus to make a
[01:43:44] letter A or Etc but it would be the same
[01:43:48] set of symbols in the full system
[01:43:50] elephants might use their trunks I don't
[01:43:52] know and of course we know that gorillas
[01:43:54] and chimps use their hands Coco can use
[01:43:56] sign language and it's in partly in the
[01:43:58] article here too um there's two other
[01:44:01] books on hands that are really important
[01:44:03] one is by um Frank Wilson called the
[01:44:06] hand um and another one is I forget the
[01:44:09] name hand in mind I think by guy named
[01:44:11] mcneel and they talk about tool making
[01:44:14] and magic tricks and musicians and all
[01:44:16] these these Dance all the uses of a hand
[01:44:19] and what it implies very very well done
[01:44:21] material um um
[01:44:25] next
[01:44:27] um I was recently listening to some of
[01:44:30] Rabbi Berg's tapes on the Zohar and be
[01:44:33] sheep yes and he uh mentioned that the
[01:44:37] large u b is bag
[01:44:41] Consciousness and that the six that
[01:44:44] follows is the generation of the
[01:44:47] subsequent six spheres in the
[01:44:50] tree the um the tree of life is
[01:44:53] generated by taking the two ways you can
[01:44:54] make the seven color map and putting
[01:44:56] them on the same Taurus and you get 10
[01:44:58] Crossing points which if you want fur
[01:45:00] I'll lay out the tree um I don't want to
[01:45:04] comment on Berg because I don't have
[01:45:08] anything nice to say okay but that
[01:45:11] doesn't mean everything he teaches is
[01:45:13] wrong um wait I this side anybody I me
[01:45:18] yes what was the first pattern that you
[01:45:21] recognized if everything started with
[01:45:23] you know the letter and then the word
[01:45:25] and then the verse would it be useful
[01:45:27] all to tell us yeah the first one I did
[01:45:29] I called the temple Tinker toy and I
[01:45:31] built it out of an old Tinker toy kit
[01:45:33] and it had these left and right
[01:45:34] symmetries and these spiraling arms and
[01:45:36] it wasn't very elegant but it laid out
[01:45:38] all the Symmetry I could find and it
[01:45:40] took me how many years Cynthia maybe
[01:45:42] almost 10 years to reduce that to these
[01:45:44] patterns it was very painful I had to
[01:45:46] try thousands of combinations and I was
[01:45:48] not easily satisfied because I'd be
[01:45:50] cheating if I were actually I was
[01:45:51] wondering when you first looked at at
[01:45:53] the uh when you first looked at
[01:45:56] Genesis and you didn't speak the
[01:45:58] language but you recognized something it
[01:46:01] was the
[01:46:02] aab ba pattern it was this repetitive
[01:46:05] introduction of the same letters here
[01:46:07] look I'll show it to you a here I'll
[01:46:09] show it to you I'll show it to you let
[01:46:11] me let me erase a little here which we
[01:46:13] don't need and I'll show you exactly
[01:46:14] what I saw as caught caught my
[01:46:21] eye good by for a transform goodbye
[01:46:42] Heisenberg this is the way that Bruce
[01:46:44] continues you see this is here this they
[01:46:49] now tell us means created
[01:46:53] um but I couldn't understand why there
[01:46:54] was such a quick repeat it seemed out of
[01:46:57] place and there were several others like
[01:46:59] that and then when I did a looking I
[01:47:01] discovered that the letters weren't
[01:47:03] introduced into the text in the normal
[01:47:06] distribution thank you for coming
[01:47:09] people
[01:47:11] um in fact there's a letter I was
[01:47:13] mentioning this earlier um when I first
[01:47:15] noticed that the letters paired off the
[01:47:17] r and the Lama went together R is a 2011
[01:47:19] count and the lit is 102 and they're
[01:47:21] Mirror Image letters and if you look at
[01:47:23] the the sentence it's re lamid re one re
[01:47:28] another re a lamid and then way out here
[01:47:29] is another re so you get this a a b a
[01:47:35] pattern which is the weaving pattern
[01:47:37] that that I eventually found well um
[01:47:39] there are letters that you would expect
[01:47:41] to see that don't show up when you look
[01:47:43] for letters in fact when you get to the
[01:47:46] I think it's the final HFF which is the
[01:47:47] 211 letter you would expect to find in
[01:47:50] the same sentence if this m if this this
[01:47:52] model were correct the 112 letter the
[01:47:56] somach but this letter doesn't show
[01:48:01] up now I told you I laid out criteria
[01:48:03] early at the beginning that I could test
[01:48:05] to see if this was worth doing well one
[01:48:07] of my criteria was that if we're taught
[01:48:10] that the Torah is a tree of life for
[01:48:11] those who grasp it it's got to have some
[01:48:13] qualities like a tree and the most
[01:48:15] obvious quality grasp it now I obviously
[01:48:17] means means to hold it in your hand um
[01:48:19] in fact Moses brings down the two
[01:48:21] tablets byard do in one hand in his hand
[01:48:24] not like that not like Charlton
[01:48:28] hon sorry um trees unfurl in golden mean
[01:48:33] proportions that's pretty common so I
[01:48:37] conjectured that there was going to be a
[01:48:39] quality to this text that had markers at
[01:48:42] golden mean counts in the letter
[01:48:44] sequence one my original
[01:48:46] ideas and um I had already realized that
[01:48:50] that letter corresponds to a golden
[01:48:52] function in the Greek alphabet the let I
[01:48:54] don't want to show it to you now
[01:48:56] but the F the damma and I can't say that
[01:49:01] the Greek name I don't remember chai aai
[01:49:03] I don't know even how to pronounce it
[01:49:04] it's one of the letters in the middle um
[01:49:06] corresponds to the golden function
[01:49:09] letters but this letter didn't show up
[01:49:12] now it's a fairly common letter not the
[01:49:13] most um it begins the word for book
[01:49:16] sephr safer um it doesn't exist in
[01:49:19] English by the way that's the the
[01:49:20] missing letter it's another s sound but
[01:49:23] there's no English equivalent for it
[01:49:24] there is a Greek
[01:49:25] equivalent
[01:49:27] um so I started counting this was before
[01:49:30] computers I bought a copy of the Hebrew
[01:49:33] Bible and I put a little number above
[01:49:35] each letter and I count it out now in
[01:49:38] ordinary use the somic occurs every 150
[01:49:42] odd letters in the Bible but I'm
[01:49:44] counting in 150 letters no Sonic I'm
[01:49:47] counting in 300 letters noic 500 letters
[01:49:51] noic finally I find the first Sonic at
[01:49:55] 2,2 and7th
[01:50:01] position well the trouble is that
[01:50:04] 2206 I has calculator I can check
[01:50:09] it it's almost an exact power of the
[01:50:12] golden
[01:50:13] mean and it occurs in a word whose name
[01:50:17] whose word that means um surround in
[01:50:20] circle so bab and the shape of the
[01:50:22] letter is pretty much a
[01:50:23] circle so I said Gee that's really
[01:50:26] anomalous and it also fits this
[01:50:29] geometric metaphor idea so that was one
[01:50:32] of the original coding things the other
[01:50:33] thing I did was the music to to Sure
[01:50:36] myself so it was an order a hearable
[01:50:39] coding that I used as a test I didn't do
[01:50:42] anything else I couldn't find anything
[01:50:44] else um one more question yeah please
[01:50:48] can you comment on the origin of the
[01:50:50] hamsa and how it relates to your work I
[01:50:53] think the hamsa is um has a hamsa is an
[01:50:57] amulet this is
[01:50:59] terrible and and they write Hebrew
[01:51:01] letters all over it um and um it's a
[01:51:05] magical amulet I think the magical and
[01:51:07] alchemical material is a bastardized
[01:51:09] version of what I'm talking about um on
[01:51:12] some of the hamsa amulets you will find
[01:51:14] a
[01:51:15] table 3x4 table which lays out
[01:51:19] permutations of the four-letter name y
[01:51:22] and hey but taking three at a time it
[01:51:25] turns out if you were to label a
[01:51:26] tetrahedron with those letters at its
[01:51:28] apex this is hard to see the 12 edges
[01:51:32] map the table on the hamsa amulet so
[01:51:35] it's a kind of condensation of some of
[01:51:37] the geometry in a kind
[01:51:40] of degraded form in my opinion and the
[01:51:44] Hand of f them I don't know enough about
[01:51:47] it is it possible that Hanson is
[01:51:51] actually a pre Jude
[01:51:53] symbol that was shared by different
[01:51:55] tribes I think that this whole model is
[01:51:57] is very ancient I think that this is
[01:52:00] this predat
[01:52:01] Judaism um that this idea of using a
[01:52:04] formal hand gesture language probably
[01:52:06] goes back before Abraham um and was lost
[01:52:09] and found and used it was a formal
[01:52:11] language not used for speech initially
[01:52:14] it probably wasn't clarified and
[01:52:15] formalized as we know it now until it
[01:52:18] became the alphabet for recording Torah
[01:52:21] Scrolls but the principal would have
[01:52:23] been known there there were hands coming
[01:52:24] off the aanat and solar disc remember um
[01:52:28] and I think that's pretty strong
[01:52:30] evidence since I'm saying that this is
[01:52:31] the sun in the middle and these hands do
[01:52:33] come off a solar disc in that
[01:52:36] metaphor um so I I think that this goes
[01:52:38] back very far you see the problem isn't
[01:52:41] the technology the good guys the bad
[01:52:44] guys everybody finds the same science in
[01:52:47] every age if they look deeply enough
[01:52:49] that what makes the religious tradition
[01:52:52] special is the way they embody this
[01:52:54] teaching um there are Traditions that
[01:52:56] try to run off and just do the technical
[01:52:58] stuff and they don't want to have any
[01:53:00] ethical considerations well they don't
[01:53:02] survive because the ethics is the
[01:53:04] external manifestation of the meditation
[01:53:06] and if you shuck the E ethics you can't
[01:53:09] reach the
[01:53:10] meditation the reason that Judaism
[01:53:12] Christianity and Islam continue and
[01:53:14] other related faiths is because they
[01:53:17] become living systems they have created
[01:53:19] a vessel that self-generate
[01:53:23] this is an oak tree that yields acorns
[01:53:25] that protect the germ of the next oak
[01:53:28] tree and any system that reaches that
[01:53:30] level is part of this
[01:53:32] Covenant that's what it's saying it's
[01:53:35] not a magical thing it's a real
[01:53:38] thing that help can we fit another one
[01:53:41] in though quickly quickly a quickie
[01:53:43] anybody a
[01:53:45] quickie please no go ahead you pulled
[01:53:49] out the the threedimensional shantra
[01:53:51] there yeah yeah equivalent the Star of
[01:53:53] David pulled into a three-dimensional I
[01:53:56] think the star of D yeah I think there's
[01:53:57] a relationship I think um um
[01:54:04] Nathaniel this is Fuller's of course
[01:54:07] well it's not directly from Fuller but
[01:54:08] this is the Cub octahedral Jitterbug
[01:54:10] that Bucky Fuller likes to point out
[01:54:13] CED see the O the octahedron he wants
[01:54:17] the octahedron
[01:54:19] um come on there and you look across it
[01:54:22] you see the double star you see and the
[01:54:25] logic the struts between um I think um
[01:54:29] Professor helstein here has a whole
[01:54:31] paper on Paradox logic and its
[01:54:33] unfoldment through this double star of
[01:54:35] David form and I'm sure he'd love to
[01:54:37] give you a copy of his paper um wasn't
[01:54:41] there also a winding around a Taurus
[01:54:43] that from one of these um illustrations
[01:54:46] he found that ends up looking an awful
[01:54:47] lot like a um star David also yeah yeah
[01:54:51] there's a 38 tourist not is one of one
[01:54:52] of the carpet
[01:54:54] Pages
[01:54:56] stay
[01:54:58] um oh I think the yeah but it's next to
[01:55:02] the West cuz this is backwards this
[01:55:04] turns out to be the 38 Taurus knot which
[01:55:06] is directly related to this is a 310
[01:55:08] taus knot very very close the Tet knots
[01:55:11] by the way are associated mathematically
[01:55:13] with the platonic solids and the
[01:55:14] Symmetry groups that relate to them um
[01:55:18] so that this actually has modern formal
[01:55:20] meaning too is that what you were
[01:55:21] thinking about yeah um maybe I should
[01:55:24] play the music unless there's somebody
[01:55:25] with a aching question um there's more
[01:55:28] on the website um we have some videos of
[01:55:31] the earlier talks um meu has no ongoing
[01:55:34] funding so we accept contributions if
[01:55:37] you need a tax deduction we are legit
[01:55:39] you can get one um go to the website H
[01:55:42] and why are you really doing all this
[01:55:44] excuse me your wife said why why are you
[01:55:46] really doing all this well I'm doing it
[01:55:48] because um I asked God if there was
[01:55:50] anything I could do to help and he
[01:55:51] dropped it on me and I couldn't walk
[01:55:53] away from it and because I believe thank
[01:55:56] you for refocusing the question I
[01:55:58] appreciate that I don't think that this
[01:56:01] is a Panacea this doesn't in itself
[01:56:03] solve problems or make us love each
[01:56:05] other or care about each other but you
[01:56:07] can't solve a problem unless you have a
[01:56:09] model an ideal a sense of where you're
[01:56:13] going this infinite anomaly I erased it
[01:56:17] is the ultimate focal point it's a
[01:56:19] common definition that doesn't offend
[01:56:22] anybody that can enable us to stretch
[01:56:25] between Singularity and
[01:56:27] wholeness and so um I see it as an
[01:56:31] ecological principle that's a vital part
[01:56:34] of planetary
[01:56:36] ecology and that um if it becomes known
[01:56:39] and appreciated will inspire the
[01:56:43] populations to act on it just like we
[01:56:46] believe the law of gravity it's about
[01:56:48] time we took the Golden Rule as a rule
[01:56:51] of Nature and not just an empty
[01:56:53] admonition and this demonstrates it
[01:56:55] might well be
[01:57:02] [Music]
