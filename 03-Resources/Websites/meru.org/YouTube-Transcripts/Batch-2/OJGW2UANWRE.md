[00:35] my name is Stan tennon and I appreciate
[00:37] you all coming um and I'm a little
[00:39] intimidated because I haven't basically
[00:40] given this presentation for a general
[00:42] audience before and so um we'll see what
[00:46] happens um there are a few things that I
[00:48] want to say first before starting this
[00:51] is work in progress and although we're
[00:54] pretty sure we're on to something here
[00:56] um I don't think it would be useful to
[00:59] assume that everything I say is true
[01:01] because I'm sure there are parts that
[01:02] aren't correct and that before we can
[01:05] make claims that are as perhaps as wide
[01:08] reaching as as these um these ideas need
[01:12] to be reviewed um they have to pass peer
[01:15] review both in the academic communities
[01:18] and in the religious communities before
[01:19] they're going to be acceptable and until
[01:22] we've done certain tests that we haven't
[01:24] done at least not to my satisfaction
[01:26] we're not ready to do that so I I would
[01:28] prefer if people consider this all
[01:29] specul ation and I'm going to speak
[01:32] quickly because that's what I do um and
[01:35] I'm going to say is when I mean maybe
[01:38] and and like that so assume when I make
[01:40] strong statements that they really are
[01:41] subject to being tested in some cases
[01:44] but see for
[01:46] yourself the basic idea
[01:49] here is that many people have said
[01:53] recently and I guess over the ages that
[01:55] there ought to be or there is or there
[01:56] should be or maybe there there has been
[01:59] relationship between physics and and
[02:02] Consciousness metaphysics if you
[02:04] will um and that's what I think we found
[02:06] here this is this is a more akin to a
[02:09] discovery this isn't an invention I
[02:11] didn't if I'm right I didn't make any of
[02:13] this up the extent I made it up it's
[02:15] probably not right um but I believe that
[02:18] this represents a philosophy a basic
[02:21] underpinning of the philosophy of many
[02:24] cultures in the ancient world and even
[02:25] into modern times I want to start by
[02:28] putting some context on this and the
[02:31] there's a quotation that I Came Upon in
[02:33] a book on Quantum Mechanics for the
[02:35] public called Quantum Reality by Nick
[02:37] Herbert where at the very end of the
[02:39] book he's getting to the point about why
[02:41] he's interested in in physics which is
[02:43] his field and he says that he believes
[02:46] one of the greatest scientific
[02:48] achievements imaginable would be the
[02:50] discovery of an explicit relationship
[02:51] between the waveform alphabets of
[02:53] quantum theory and certain human States
[02:55] Of
[02:56] Consciousness now he didn't really mean
[02:59] mean an ordinary alphabet when he says
[03:01] alphabets of quantum theory but in a
[03:03] sense he
[03:05] does and I think that's what we really
[03:07] have here I think that the ancient world
[03:09] um the Greek World perhaps even earlier
[03:12] the Hebrew World um later the Muslim
[03:14] world world the cultures that have made
[03:16] claims that their alphabets are sacred
[03:18] are special and that their alphabets are
[03:20] the alphabets of creation or reality or
[03:24] other special special status people
[03:27] making those claims in all these
[03:28] cultures and those claims are made for
[03:30] Hebrew and Greek and Arabic and Sanskrit
[03:32] and some of the Tibetan alphabets and
[03:34] many others that people who make these
[03:37] claims should be taken seriously um yes
[03:40] there are people who make claims like
[03:42] that and it's just religious puffery or
[03:44] it's just sort of a poetic license while
[03:46] our our alphabet is special we're going
[03:48] to call it sacred but many of the people
[03:50] who made these claims have have
[03:52] wellestablished track records um the the
[03:55] rabbis um the the Greek mathematicians
[03:58] all have other works that they've
[04:00] demonstrated their confidence in and I
[04:02] think it it it makes sense to take what
[04:04] they said seriously so that's basically
[04:06] what we're going to look at
[04:08] here the question first arises is how
[04:11] can a letter be an element of creation
[04:14] these alphabets are sacred I put the
[04:16] Hebrew letter B on the Blackboard this
[04:17] is its printed form and this is its
[04:20] script form I'm just going to leave them
[04:22] there the question does come up how how
[04:25] can how can a letter I just drew a
[04:26] letter on the how can that be an element
[04:27] of creation what meaning can that have
[04:31] think about
[04:32] it I want to tell you about the letter B
[04:35] though because it's the beginning of the
[04:36] story anyhow it's the first letter of
[04:39] I'm need a pointer for some of this I
[04:41] remember where let WR down here this is
[04:43] the first verse of of of the text of
[04:45] Genesis in Hebrew normally translated in
[04:48] the beginning God created the Heaven and
[04:50] the
[04:50] Earth um the first letter is the letter
[04:54] b and the letter B in Hebrew its name is
[04:57] bait um means how
[05:01] means archetypal container the
[05:03] distinction between inside and
[05:06] outside that's the first thing that
[05:09] happens in the life of a child when a
[05:11] child is born the first thing that
[05:13] happens is the child has to breathe in
[05:15] and out and that's an unconscious action
[05:18] and then a little later the child has to
[05:19] eat and in order to eat it has to
[05:21] distinguish between inside where the
[05:22] food goes and outside where it comes
[05:24] from the first element of our
[05:26] Consciousness is the distinction between
[05:28] inside or outside
[05:30] also there's an understanding of that
[05:33] that relates to physics and to
[05:34] metaphysics which we'll get to I want
[05:36] have to leave that on the table now I
[05:38] wanted to start off and I'll have to ask
[05:40] your Indulgence by reading some
[05:41] quotations the reason I'm going to read
[05:43] these quotations is because they contain
[05:45] ideas that are not commonly known and
[05:48] that most Jews and Christians I don't
[05:49] know if we have any Muslims here but
[05:51] basically most people who know about the
[05:53] Bible know about religious ideas don't
[05:55] know this and many people violently
[05:58] reject what I'm going to read what I'm
[06:00] going to read is I I'll give you the
[06:02] references these are mostly rinic
[06:04] references but I go a little farther a
[06:05] field than that so let me just read them
[06:07] to give you a sense of some
[06:08] possibilities here because I'm going to
[06:10] be playing with the letters of the text
[06:12] of Genesis and the question is what
[06:14] right do I have to do that doesn't
[06:16] everyone know what the text of Genesis
[06:18] says hasn't it been translated often
[06:20] enough by now the answer is maybe too
[06:25] often first quote is um quoted in Rab
[06:28] Rabbi AR kaplan's book um life the light
[06:31] Beyond adventures in histic thought it's
[06:34] attributed to Rabbi yahoshua Aram of
[06:36] zitar and he
[06:39] says our sages teach us that the Torah
[06:42] was created 2,000 years before the
[06:45] world this is difficult to understand
[06:48] since the Torah contains accounts of
[06:50] many events that happened after creation
[06:52] how can the Torah speak of creation Adam
[06:53] and Eve Noah the holy Patriarchs and all
[06:56] the other things recorded in the Torah
[06:58] all these things had not yet happened
[06:59] when the Torah was written then he
[07:01] explains actually when the Torah was
[07:04] first created it was a mixture of
[07:06] letters the letters of the Torah were
[07:08] not yet combined into words as they are
[07:10] now whenever anything then happened in
[07:13] the world these letters were combined
[07:14] and the words were recombined to form
[07:16] the account this was true of the account
[07:18] of creation the story of Adam and Eve
[07:21] the letters combined with each other
[07:22] forming the words that told this story
[07:24] similarly when an individual died a
[07:26] combination of letters was formed saying
[07:28] that he died the same same was true of
[07:30] the rest of the
[07:31] Torah as soon as an event that was to be
[07:33] recorded in Torah took place a
[07:35] combination was immediately formed
[07:37] corresponding to that event if a
[07:39] different event had taken place the
[07:41] letters would have combined
[07:45] differently interesting
[07:48] idea um a further comment by another
[07:51] Rabbi this is Rabbi Levi yok also quoted
[07:54] by Kaplan in its sequence of the
[07:56] sentence this lowly world the Torah must
[07:58] become clothed in a material garment
[08:00] which often consists of stories and
[08:02] these are the stories that have been
[08:03] translated of course when God grants a
[08:05] person knowledge understanding and
[08:07] intelligence uncovering the mass that
[08:08] blinds his eyes he can see the wonders
[08:10] of God's Torah the people on this level
[08:12] are few however and the majority only
[08:14] understand the Torah according to its
[08:15] simple
[08:16] meaning um the creationists are not
[08:19] going to like what I'm going to be
[08:20] presenting here today because I'm not
[08:22] talking about the story in Genesis at
[08:24] all although we'll see why the story
[08:26] does have some relevance it's basically
[08:28] a simp
[08:31] Le metaphor for the deeper
[08:35] metaphor and here's a another fellow
[08:38] makes even a stronger statement this is
[08:39] in the Zohar and it's quoted by Lewis
[08:41] Ginsburg and it says Zohar is one of the
[08:44] chief calistic books says wo unto the
[08:47] man who asserts that this Torah intends
[08:49] to relate only commonplace things and
[08:51] secular narratives for if this were so
[08:53] then in the present times likewise a
[08:55] Torah might be written with more
[08:56] attractive narratives now the narratives
[08:58] of the Torah are garments he who thinks
[09:01] that these garments are the Torah itself
[09:02] deserves to perish and have no share in
[09:04] the world to come woe unto the fools who
[09:07] look no further when they see an elegant
[09:08] robe more valuable than the Garment is
[09:11] the body which carries it and more
[09:12] valuable even than that is the soul
[09:15] which animates the body fools see only
[09:17] the Garment of the Torah the more
[09:18] intelligent see the body the wise see
[09:20] the soul its proper being and in the
[09:23] messic time the upper soul of the Torah
[09:25] will stand
[09:28] revealed the the idea is that we're not
[09:30] looking at just a sequence of
[09:34] stories now I want to now that we know
[09:37] that this isn't just a set of stories
[09:38] what is it and I have a couple of other
[09:40] quotes that give us some sense as to
[09:41] what might be going on here this is from
[09:44] um Carlos Suarez who is a calist um died
[09:47] a few years ago um this is from his
[09:49] Cipher of Genesis and he says in the
[09:52] severity of its beginning in its first
[09:54] chapter in its first verse in its first
[09:57] sequence of letter numbers all of a
[09:59] sudden these are no longer just letters
[10:01] they're letter
[10:04] numbers is the seed and in the seed is
[10:07] the hole this hole can be and is
[10:10] expected to be grasped in the bit R
[10:14] alive Shin y of bid that's the first
[10:17] word there this sequence is the
[10:20] Revelation is in the Revelation and
[10:22] those who graspit are in the Revelation
[10:24] and are in action the Revelation
[10:28] itself but he saying
[10:30] is that there's some sort of a secret
[10:33] some sort of a numerical mathematical
[10:35] some kind of a coding in sequence of
[10:38] letters that make up the text and that
[10:40] they represent the Revelation the deep
[10:42] meaning of the text and what the other
[10:45] rabbis were saying um and this is
[10:47] knowledge that would have been known in
[10:49] early Christian times too these aren't
[10:50] recent U understandings this is recent
[10:52] quotes maybe a thousand years old but
[10:54] they're not this isn't new ideas in
[10:56] Judaism so they were this is true in the
[10:57] Christian world too although I doubt
[10:59] many Christians or Jews know about it
[11:01] the the text itself is kind of
[11:05] like it's like a uh a source a plenum a
[11:09] a a in the physicist World it be like a
[11:12] manifold of potential possibilities and
[11:15] then when an event happens the letters
[11:17] are grouped together and vowelization is
[11:19] added so that there's a story meaning
[11:21] that comes out that corresponds to the
[11:22] history at least that's what the rabbis
[11:24] are saying um you have to know about
[11:26] Hebrew to understand that that there
[11:28] aren't any Val in Hebrew the the letters
[11:32] um the alphabet is up on top here all of
[11:35] these letters have consonantal V Valu as
[11:38] consonants the the vowels are little
[11:40] notations that are added and I don't
[11:41] think there's any vowels at all I don't
[11:43] think I even Drew any vowels no the
[11:44] vowels are little symbols that are
[11:46] placed either below or above the letters
[11:48] and they have
[11:49] vocalization also um the original texts
[11:52] as I've drawn it here aren't broken up
[11:54] into words um how you break up the text
[11:58] into words and what visualization you
[12:00] put on the clusters of letters gives you
[12:02] a great range a great freedom in what
[12:04] story it ends up saying so I wanted to
[12:07] to leave you with a sense that that
[12:09] there's room for there to be more here
[12:11] than a story and then the question is
[12:13] well what is it let me tell you what
[12:15] what meu is why we're calling our
[12:17] foundation meu foundation and what the
[12:19] meu project is the word meu has meaning
[12:22] in many different cultures and languages
[12:25] um most of you may have heard of it as
[12:27] the name of the world Mountain that
[12:29] exist in the midst of the land of
[12:30] Shambala where one incarnates in the
[12:33] Eastern Traditions if one is
[12:34] sufficiently Advanced that one's not
[12:36] going to fall back and so you you climb
[12:38] Mount meu to get to Shambala and
[12:40] Shambala sits in the middle of a meu
[12:42] sits in the middle of Shambala World
[12:44] Mountain so it's like Mount Olympus or
[12:46] or any other world Mountain it also
[12:49] turns out in Indian tradition to be the
[12:51] name of the Pascal triangle now the
[12:54] Pascal triangle is an unfoldment of
[12:56] numbers that are are like the golden
[12:59] mean proportion they all sort of add one
[13:02] to another and they they mimic the
[13:04] growth of all living things the sequence
[13:06] of numbers the Fibonacci series The
[13:08] Pascal triangle the golden mean
[13:10] proportion that's the unfoldment
[13:12] proportion for the geometry of all
[13:13] living things and that mountain that
[13:16] that unfoldment is called Mount meu
[13:19] interesting connection the name of the
[13:21] Hebrew alphabet is
[13:23] maruba and the meru part refers to what
[13:26] I'm as I will show you to the vortex
[13:28] shape and the the ba in Hebrew from the
[13:30] letter b means Box means container of
[13:33] means in it so we have some sort of a
[13:36] vortex in a
[13:37] box now the word maruba to
[13:41] ordinary discussion is said to derive
[13:44] from the word araba in Hebrew which
[13:46] means fourfold which means four so
[13:48] maruba would mean fourfold if you think
[13:50] of the fourfold if you're thinking flat
[13:53] which is I'll have to erase my little
[13:55] bait here to get a little room you're
[13:56] thinking of the fourfold and it's flat
[13:58] then it's a square
[13:59] which is what most people believe the
[14:01] maruba the ARA refers to name the Hebrew
[14:03] alphabet because the letters are kind of
[14:05] square shaped the letters on the very
[14:07] top they're kind of square but if you're
[14:09] thinking in three dimensions which is a
[14:11] much more accurate model of our world
[14:14] then the object that looks square that's
[14:15] fourfold is the tetrahedron it looks
[14:18] like a square if you hold it just
[14:21] so and so if you would have draw it on a
[14:24] piece of paper and then the Inquisition
[14:26] would have come along and kill you off
[14:28] which happens periodically
[14:30] your successor who tried to interpret
[14:31] your drawings would misidentify what you
[14:33] had drawn and one of the reasons why I
[14:36] believe what I've got up here hasn't
[14:37] been known for a long time is because
[14:39] that's exactly what happened the
[14:40] Inquisition rolled through periodically
[14:42] the generic Inquisition if you will for
[14:44] the last several thousand years and
[14:47] notations and drawings were drawn flat
[14:50] and were assumed to be flat when they
[14:52] were
[14:53] rediscovered but they should have been
[14:54] drawn three dimensionally and if they
[14:56] were if they did represent
[14:58] threedimensional objects then the texts
[14:59] that accompan the drawings would make
[15:01] sense instead of read like poetry only
[15:04] which is often how they're
[15:06] translated um the root Mar itself in the
[15:10] romance languages refers to the sea I
[15:12] think that comes from its basis in wave
[15:14] motion this foric
[15:17] motion um there's also another form of
[15:20] of Mount meru and that is in the eastern
[15:23] tradition there is a very famous mandal
[15:25] the mandal of creation the shantra
[15:30] and it is supposed to exist in a meru
[15:32] form which is shown to be a set of
[15:35] stacked
[15:37] plates in fact the Transformations that
[15:40] I'm going to show you on the Hebrew text
[15:42] also work on the Eastern tradition and
[15:45] if one takes the flat miru mandala and
[15:48] pulls it out into three
[15:50] dimensions you can see the the same
[15:52] mandala if you look straight at me as I
[15:54] scan
[15:55] around and then one can see the real
[15:58] structure of what there would be a
[15:59] mountain called
[16:00] Meo and we'll uh hopefully get to some
[16:04] opportunity to play with that I also
[16:05] have one model here that lights up we
[16:06] can play with
[16:07] later all right that will serve as a
[16:11] sort of introduction let me show you
[16:13] what I did and what I found and then
[16:15] let's talk about the significance of it
[16:17] which is probably the greater part of
[16:18] the
[16:22] discussion I think the easiest way to
[16:24] tell you how this all came about is to
[16:26] tell it to you historically I was uh
[16:29] sitting in my apartment in Newton
[16:30] Massachusetts in
[16:31] 1968 and I had this urge to look at the
[16:34] beginning of Genesis in Hebrew which was
[16:37] a strange urge considering the fact that
[16:38] I didn't read Hebrew although I did know
[16:41] the
[16:42] alphabet now I have one talent in this
[16:46] world and that is I'm a visual pattern
[16:47] recognizer maybe has become evident
[16:51] already um and my eyes fell on the
[16:53] letters and I could not get it out of my
[16:55] head that there was something peculiar
[16:57] about the sequence of letters just
[16:59] didn't look like language to me since I
[17:01] couldn't read it that was a further
[17:02] reason why it didn't look like
[17:04] language um if it had looked like
[17:07] language if I had been a good student in
[17:09] my earlier days and had learned to read
[17:11] Hebrew I would have just like you pick
[17:12] up a piece of paper in any language you
[17:14] don't start counting letters and look at
[17:15] letter patterns you simply read what's
[17:16] said there and I never would have seen
[17:18] this so I ased around assuming that
[17:21] Genesis was the most heavily researched
[17:23] document going and people told me they
[17:26] didn't know what I was talking about I
[17:28] asked the rabbi I asked the priest I
[17:30] went over to MIT I went over to Harvard
[17:32] I nothing eventually people told me this
[17:34] must be calot must be Hebrew mysticism
[17:37] I'd never heard of
[17:38] cabala um so I decided I'd better get
[17:41] educated if I was going to figure out
[17:43] what was going on here and I realized
[17:44] that if no one knew about this and there
[17:46] really was some kind of coding in the
[17:48] letters of the text of Genesis then this
[17:51] could be very important and we'll see
[17:53] why that may
[17:55] be so I uh I read just about everything
[17:58] I could find in English on cabala I read
[18:02] Hebrew material I read Christian
[18:04] material I read Arabic material I read
[18:06] Greek material the pagaran mysticism I
[18:08] read some Eastern material um I read
[18:11] stuff printed in green ink from people
[18:13] who' been up in flying saucers I read
[18:14] stuff written by very conservative
[18:16] rabbis who really didn't like to write
[18:17] anything down at all and say as little
[18:19] as possible and I started to put
[18:22] together a sense that even though I
[18:25] couldn't figure out what they were
[18:26] talking about it was very nice poetry
[18:29] and yes there might very well be
[18:30] meditations involved um the literary
[18:34] criticism methods that the academic
[18:37] Scholars used to make sense of calistic
[18:39] texts didn't do much for me yes I could
[18:41] see you can compare this sentence to
[18:42] that sentence but that didn't tell me
[18:45] anything about what the author was
[18:46] saying it just told me he was saying the
[18:47] same thing here as
[18:49] here and
[18:52] eventually after 10 years I started to
[18:55] build up a sense that these calistic
[18:57] texts were talking about something
[18:59] there was just too many
[19:01] details for it to be pulled out of the
[19:03] air there was just too much commonality
[19:06] to be to be the these texts to be the
[19:08] individual experiences of of of Mystics
[19:11] there was there was something that bound
[19:13] it all together and it didn't matter if
[19:14] I was really rosac crucian material or
[19:16] reading Sanskrit material in English
[19:18] translation um or or Hebrew material it
[19:21] it all seemed to have the same
[19:22] underpinning and many others have
[19:24] claimed this too there there are
[19:26] numerous teachers and over the centuries
[19:28] who who claim the same
[19:30] thing um but I wasn't Satisfied by them
[19:33] simply telling me it was all the same it
[19:35] didn't look the same it just felt the
[19:37] same so the idea was to find out what
[19:38] was going on well what did I do I didn't
[19:41] know what to do it was really rather
[19:43] rather confusing I had the first verse
[19:44] of Genesis
[19:46] here um if I use the names of letters
[19:49] I'll use the English equivalent letter
[19:50] names because I think everyone will know
[19:53] them and not everyone will know the
[19:54] Hebrew or the Greek names and they all
[19:56] they're all in parallel at least almost
[19:57] all of them towards the of the alphabet
[19:59] there've been some substitutions so um
[20:01] bet in Hebrew is our letter B is beta in
[20:04] Greek and R in Hebrew is our letter r is
[20:07] the Greek letter row and it it's
[20:09] completely parallel through the tech
[20:10] through all of the alphabet and that's
[20:12] because they use these alphabets as
[20:13] counting systems and they're all in the
[20:16] same alphabetical order and a was always
[20:18] one and B was always two and you counted
[20:20] through the alphabet and you have this
[20:21] numerological gatria system which most
[20:23] people think that's what's going on in
[20:25] the calistic material it's just a bunch
[20:27] of number mysticism
[20:29] well that that wasn't very convincing to
[20:31] me and I looked and looked and looked at
[20:33] this this first verse and I couldn't
[20:37] figure out what to do with it but I kept
[20:38] remembering what Suarez had said and I
[20:41] read other places also and the idea is
[20:43] that the secret of the universe is
[20:44] supposed to be in the first
[20:46] letter but if you're not bright enough
[20:48] to figure it out from the first letter
[20:49] God In His Infinite Mercy repeats it in
[20:51] Greater detail in the first word if you
[20:53] can't figure it out from the first word
[20:54] oh well don't worry God preach it in the
[20:56] first verse it's description of
[20:58] hierarchical array now I don't know
[21:01] about you but it wasn't obvious to me
[21:03] right off that that letter how that
[21:06] meant the secret of the universe that
[21:07] just didn't do it for me and the first
[21:10] word that would have been nice except I
[21:12] didn't know what the first word was I
[21:14] mean it's fine most people translate
[21:16] that first word that is the first word
[21:18] bit it means in and the word Ro R and
[21:23] head refers to the Head the word in
[21:25] Hebrew means a head and so it means in
[21:27] at the head of in the
[21:29] beginning but there's no reason to take
[21:31] that as the first word these weren't bro
[21:32] the letters weren't broken up into words
[21:34] here's another sequence of b r and a
[21:36] just like here except this sequence is
[21:38] translated he
[21:40] created and this little three-letter
[21:42] sequence has a meaning it means for
[21:45] instance six or it means a thorn it
[21:47] means many other things too there's
[21:49] actually over 900 official talmudic
[21:51] translations to the first vers alone so
[21:53] there's a little flexibility in the
[21:55] meaning here but it seemed to me that
[22:00] I didn't know what the first word
[22:02] was now the first verse that I could
[22:05] look at it was long enough for me to
[22:08] play with short enough for me to look at
[22:12] long enough to have enough information
[22:13] and the first word of the next verse
[22:15] repeats the last word of the first verse
[22:17] so even if this wasn't a natural unit
[22:19] there's a fold Point here there's a
[22:21] reason to believe that I can stop at
[22:23] this point and
[22:25] examine what am I going to examine
[22:29] not what you can do with
[22:31] that well over the 10 years I had drawn
[22:34] up a set of criteria of what I was
[22:36] looking for if there was going to be
[22:38] anything and if it was going to be
[22:39] findable and I made a a simple analogy
[22:42] with something that was current at the
[22:44] time I was doing this must be about 15
[22:46] years ago now that the folks at the jet
[22:49] propulsion laboratory decided to send a
[22:50] message into outer space by the radio
[22:53] telescope in aroso Puerto Rico and they
[22:55] devised a binary code that made a little
[22:58] black and white TV picture of a man and
[23:01] the Elements of Life and a little
[23:03] picture of DNA and of the solar system
[23:05] it was a black and white TV
[23:07] picture and the reason they did that is
[23:09] because they deduced that folks living
[23:11] on Alpha centuri or other star systems
[23:13] someplace in the universe who might
[23:15] receive our message weren't likely to
[23:16] speak English or Sanskrit or Swahili or
[23:19] any other Earth
[23:20] language that whatever message they were
[23:23] going to send over several thousand
[23:25] years of SpaceTime had to be in some
[23:28] kind of a universal form it had to be
[23:31] decipherable by whoever got it no matter
[23:34] what their idea of language was and the
[23:36] key for breaking into it had to be given
[23:39] had to be there right up front had to be
[23:40] very obvious and so they designed in
[23:42] their little TV picture the kind of
[23:44] qualities they thought would enable
[23:45] someone to independently ReDiscover
[23:47] their TV
[23:49] picture well it occurred to me that
[23:51] 2,000 years of SpaceTime is hardly any
[23:54] different than 2,000 years of Earth time
[23:57] that over course of two or 3,000 years
[24:00] which is the supposed history of these
[24:02] texts um language becomes dead becomes
[24:05] lost meanings change it's hard for us to
[24:07] read Shakespearean English at this point
[24:09] we can still do it but it's difficult um
[24:12] Hebrew became a dead language during the
[24:14] Babylonian exile and was only
[24:15] reconstituted by Ezra at about 500 BC
[24:19] the Hebrew that Israelis speak today was
[24:21] made up about 100 Years Ago by a guy
[24:22] named Yehuda Ben um no somebody Ben Ben
[24:26] Yehuda forget his first name so that
[24:30] there wasn't any necessary link between
[24:32] what happened 3,000 years ago and now
[24:34] and besides the people 3,000 years ago
[24:36] or 2,000 years
[24:38] ago if they had something of extreme
[24:41] importance that they wanted to preserve
[24:43] they couldn't assume that their language
[24:45] would survive so if there was something
[24:48] recoverable and it was really important
[24:50] and the people who knew it or had it at
[24:52] the time wanted it to be recoverable
[24:54] they would have had to have provided for
[24:56] it to be self- decoding and that was one
[24:58] of my original criteria there had to be
[24:59] a key a crypto marker a way to break
[25:01] into the system if there was a system
[25:03] and it had to be throughout the text and
[25:05] it had to be especially at the beginning
[25:08] the beginning might not survive so you
[25:09] have to have it throughout the text as
[25:11] well well I decided to look for such a
[25:13] way to break into the
[25:15] system it took me several years um I
[25:20] didn't know what to do but I did hear
[25:22] another Legend which was very
[25:23] interesting I've got it up on top here
[25:25] the the Hebrew alphabet that Ezra came
[25:27] up with is this alphabet up on top
[25:30] so-called maruba Square form Aramaic
[25:33] style
[25:34] alphabet um it has 27 letters in groups
[25:37] three groups of
[25:38] nine um but Ezra did something at least
[25:41] Ezra was supposed to have done something
[25:43] according to the rabic tradition He
[25:44] restored the original form of the
[25:46] letters according to the academic
[25:48] Scholars he adopted the Aramaic letters
[25:51] and added five letters at the end of the
[25:54] alphabet which are final forms of
[25:57] earlier letters if you want to make an m
[25:59] in the middle of the alphabet you draw
[26:01] it that way if it's the last letter of a
[26:03] word you draw it that
[26:04] way well if you start to insert final
[26:07] letters into the text you start to Def
[26:10] Define word divisions all of a sudden so
[26:12] you start to be able to break the text
[26:15] up and the thing about this alphabet is
[26:18] as the the Christians have taught and as
[26:20] the Jews teach and I don't know if mlims
[26:22] teach the same thing um to change a jot
[26:25] or a tit of these sacred texts would be
[26:27] disas would be a terrible heresy would
[26:30] me might mean the end of the world if
[26:32] the Torah is as the Jews teach the
[26:36] template of creation the pattern that
[26:39] God looked into to create the world if
[26:41] you change a letter then you change the
[26:44] creation and so rabbis who believe this
[26:47] certainly weren't going to change any
[26:48] letters but on the other hand we're told
[26:50] that Ezra changed the whole alphabet
[26:52] from the Canaanite alphabet and added
[26:54] five final letter forms and rewrote all
[26:56] of the texts slightly inconsistent
[27:00] story well the important part is that
[27:03] the 27 letters is not an arbitrary
[27:05] number of letters it's an explicit
[27:07] number and it finally dawned on me that
[27:10] the first verse of
[27:11] Genesis had a string of 27 letters
[27:15] followed by the 27th
[27:18] letter it's 28 letters Al together 27
[27:23] letters the 27th letter and a 27 letter
[27:26] alphabet that comes along with it three
[27:28] statements of 27 27 is 3
[27:31] cubed I said to myself G I wonder what
[27:34] would happen if I counted the Letters
[27:35] Out in base three by
[27:37] threes well I ultimately tried other
[27:40] bases also but when I counted by threes
[27:42] interesting things started to
[27:44] happen and what I did is I simply
[27:46] started with the ol if is zero not as
[27:48] one like the numerologist do because I'm
[27:51] going to be looking at a geometric
[27:52] system not a system of arithmetic and
[27:54] the first count geometrically is the
[27:56] origin the reference point and the olive
[28:00] as you can see is a funny shape it has
[28:02] this diagonal swath down the middle and
[28:05] as I realized later an olive is really
[28:07] nothing but the head and tail of the
[28:12] snake that eats its tail the oroboros
[28:15] which is another name for the Hebrew
[28:16] alphabet if you
[28:18] connect the second letter the last
[28:21] letter upside down is if it came around
[28:23] under it then you have a little Olive
[28:25] and so another reason for considering it
[28:27] to be the the splice point the odd
[28:29] letter the zero count so I count from 0
[28:31] to 26 and I count by threes 0 1 2 1 0 1
[28:36] 1 one2 two 21 22 um it's just like
[28:40] counting by twos or by by tens as we
[28:42] normally do after you get up to two you
[28:43] have to carry because in base three the
[28:47] three is the base that's the the power
[28:49] that you carry by um when you do that
[28:52] you get a little digit a little a little
[28:54] number associated with each letter which
[28:55] is really nothing but its position in
[28:57] the alphabet other words this letter K
[29:00] says the 10th letter starting with all
[29:02] of is zero and 10 in base three is
[29:04] written
[29:05] one1 very simple well then finally again
[29:09] after many months of staring off into
[29:10] space it occurred to me
[29:13] that I could use those same little
[29:16] numbers that are the position of the
[29:18] letters in the alphabet and consider
[29:20] them to be cartisian
[29:21] coordinates and so I ended up putting
[29:23] the letters of the alphabet on this nice
[29:26] little model that Dr rubben was kind
[29:28] enough to make for us
[29:29] all um and they're simply in in the same
[29:34] order as it says there if the letter is
[29:36] is say um the
[29:37] letter letter H 021 I took that to be at
[29:42] the location on an X XYZ coordinate
[29:46] system to um 0 comma 2 comma 1 xal 0 Y =
[29:52] 2 Z = 1 and so I'm out over
[29:55] here and so every letter gets a location
[29:58] given by its cartisian coordinate given
[30:00] by its letter letter count it's position
[30:02] in the alphabet and that means that the
[30:04] alphabet Stacks up in three layers just
[30:08] like it does according to traditional
[30:10] teachings except now the letters are on
[30:12] this symmetrical
[30:14] object kind of
[30:16] interesting then I noticed something
[30:18] else that was very strange again this
[30:19] was the this was the hardest part and I
[30:21] I Must Have Spent gee it was several
[30:24] weeks just staring at this stuff
[30:25] scratching my head saying what can I
[30:27] possibly do to comp that alphabet to
[30:28] that
[30:30] verse well it I finally was reduced to
[30:35] lering idiot status which is the proper
[30:38] humble position for learning anything
[30:40] after trying all the the tricks of of
[30:42] set theory and all kinds of permutations
[30:44] and and wild charts and graphs this and
[30:47] that I was reduced to blithering idiot
[30:49] status and I merely
[30:51] decided to check off on the cube the
[30:54] letters that were used in the first
[30:56] verse and cut away the rest of the Cube
[30:58] and see what I had
[31:00] left so I did that I took a
[31:03] cube now in this case it's just the
[31:05] points not little cuets and I checked
[31:08] off the letters that occurred in the
[31:09] first verse and I cut away the letters
[31:11] that didn't occur and I was left with
[31:13] this
[31:14] object and I was very
[31:17] surprised because it had no right to be
[31:20] symmetrical and yet it
[31:23] was now that could be by just
[31:26] coincidence could be random a
[31:28] statistician friend over at UC Berkeley
[31:30] a few weeks ago said that he he did some
[31:32] quick tests and he thought maybe one
[31:33] time in a 100 if you did what I did
[31:34] you'd get a symmetrical object it's not
[31:37] a hard and fast rule but that's a nice
[31:39] number so might have might have meant
[31:41] something I didn't know what but then I
[31:43] noticed something really
[31:45] extraordinary I noticed that in this
[31:47] first
[31:49] verse some letters occurred once some
[31:52] letters occurred twice some letters
[31:55] occurred three times and the olive the
[31:57] letter A occurred six times and that's
[31:58] all there aren't any letters that occur
[32:00] four times there aren't any letters that
[32:02] occur five
[32:04] times and then I noticed that the
[32:07] letters that occurred now I'm only going
[32:09] to be looking at the first 27 I'm not
[32:10] looking at that last letter because I'm
[32:12] comparing 27 to 27 the letters that
[32:14] occurred an even number of times in the
[32:17] first verse are all on the axis of
[32:20] symmetry and the letters that occurred
[32:22] once are opposite the letters that occur
[32:24] three
[32:25] times there are three of these
[32:30] RS one two three and one
[32:36] L three Rs and one
[32:39] L there are three T's and one
[32:43] F there are three E's and one
[32:48] M that's kind of strange and so I
[32:52] decided just to see what would
[32:54] happen to look at RS and L's
[32:58] in T's and Fs in E and M's and the
[33:01] others that are in symmetrical positions
[33:03] as if they were related to each other
[33:05] somehow just because I was curious was
[33:08] desperate what what what I was I was
[33:10] really hoping to find
[33:12] something and of course when I did that
[33:15] um it got interesting very quickly
[33:17] because what I found is that every group
[33:20] of letters that were in symmetrical
[33:22] positions now you don't have to have a
[33:24] cube to know they're in symmetrical
[33:25] positions because the way the cartisian
[33:26] coordinate system works you get Mirror
[33:28] Image coordinates the 2011 letter is in
[33:31] symmetrical position to the 102 letter
[33:33] and if a letter is self symmetric it'll
[33:35] have a symmetrical count such as 202 or
[33:38] 212 and it'll be on the axis of symmetry
[33:42] which is the main diagonal of the cube
[33:44] diagonal plane of the
[33:46] cube um in the the packets we have there
[33:48] there's a template for making your own
[33:50] cubes for those of you who want pick
[33:51] those up
[33:53] later well let's see what happens I have
[33:57] a an R
[33:58] R I have another R then I get my first L
[34:03] then I get an
[34:04] r r r
[34:07] LR well let's look at the t's and the fs
[34:10] I get a t i get another T I get an F did
[34:15] I get a t t t f t gee that's strange
[34:21] that's the same
[34:22] order e e m e
[34:27] you mean they're all going to do
[34:30] that yeah matter of fact if you go
[34:33] through the text the first time a letter
[34:34] is used in any verse in the same verse a
[34:37] letter on the symmetrical side of the
[34:39] cube is
[34:40] used now that's too often to be qu
[34:43] there's one Exception by the way and
[34:44] that exception turns out to be even more
[34:46] interesting the um by the way the the
[34:49] Y's the I's and the B's are reversed
[34:52] it's i b i i because this initial b
[34:56] pairs with this final body final Z to
[35:00] make this spin axis which I'll show you
[35:02] later and this is kind of reverse
[35:04] handoff to the next sentence and so the
[35:07] pattern's the same but it's turned
[35:08] upside down because it's hooking to the
[35:09] other thing it's sort of a reverse thing
[35:12] keeps keeps flipping on itself we'll see
[35:15] a little more about how that that fits
[35:16] together later but here's the
[35:18] interesting thing you know if you look
[35:21] for 20 years and you're reasonably
[35:24] clever you're going to find patterns
[35:27] there's no big deal to finding patterns
[35:29] the question isn't whether you can find
[35:31] patterns the question is whether they
[35:32] have any
[35:34] meaning if you introduce an idea and it
[35:37] has nothing to do with what you're doing
[35:40] you won't get any new information out by
[35:41] using that idea you know if you're
[35:44] trying to listen to the high-fi you turn
[35:45] the light out in the room it doesn't
[35:46] change the sound for most
[35:49] people well you
[35:51] know sure these days um but if you do
[35:56] something and when you turn that crank
[35:59] you use that little tool all kinds of
[36:02] things happen and they're interesting
[36:03] things and you start to get get a sense
[36:05] of what you're doing you get more out
[36:06] than you put in then you have a right to
[36:08] suspect strongly that what you did had
[36:11] something to do with what you did it to
[36:13] when I Shine the Light of base three on
[36:15] the text all of a sudden I start to get
[36:20] patterns the only thing you can tell
[36:22] about this pattern is one it certainly
[36:24] isn't a coincidence and in fact um
[36:27] researchers at UCLA and at barlon
[36:30] University in Israel and at techon in
[36:32] hia Israel have done statistical tests
[36:34] on the text they hadn't done it when I
[36:36] first did this but they have now and
[36:38] there's no question that there's letter
[36:40] level coding throughout Five Books of
[36:42] Moses they've also found some coding in
[36:44] gospels but because these are Jews doing
[36:46] the work Orthodox Jews they don't want
[36:48] to talk about that in public so if there
[36:50] are any Christians out here iot to know
[36:51] about the gospels you'll have to do the
[36:53] work for yourself because the rabbis
[36:55] won't do it for you
[36:58] well one thing does come of this when I
[37:01] use base three to count out the letters
[37:03] the whole first verse becomes one unit
[37:06] there aren't any letters left over
[37:08] everything has its
[37:11] place well what what can I do I still
[37:13] can't identify what that looks
[37:16] like there's another teaching a rabbi
[37:18] teaching and the teaching is that the
[37:21] Torah is eternal the Torah is unique
[37:25] it's not just a bunch of stories it's
[37:27] not like anything else not even like
[37:29] anything else sacred in Judaism such as
[37:31] the talid which is extremely important
[37:33] the basis of Jewish practices in the
[37:35] talid but the Torah can't even be
[37:37] compared to the tal that would be
[37:38] sacrilege Torah is so unique it can only
[37:41] be compared to
[37:43] itself so I decided to compare it to
[37:46] itself seemed
[37:47] reasonable how do you compare a text to
[37:49] itself well now we back to literary
[37:51] criticism should I look at the the first
[37:53] story in Genesis of gen of the creation
[37:54] and the second and compare how they
[37:56] differ well that's already been DED it
[37:58] wasn't very satisfying and besides it
[38:00] didn't give me anything new to work
[38:02] with I'm looking at the letters so I
[38:05] said what would happen if I compared the
[38:06] letters to
[38:08] themselves and that's what I did you
[38:10] know how you make a paper dollar or a
[38:11] paper airplane take a piece of paper you
[38:14] stick tab A into slot a then you put tab
[38:16] B into slot B and tab C into slot C you
[38:20] autoc correlate it you correlate it with
[38:22] itself tab a with slot a tab B with slot
[38:25] B and the piece of paper folds up
[38:28] hopefully into the model it was intended
[38:30] to make and so I decided to fold up this
[38:33] string of letters in such a way that
[38:37] letters that were the same were going to
[38:39] be next to each other and if I couldn't
[38:41] find letters that were the same I was
[38:43] going to allow myself one other piece of
[38:44] freedom I was going to allow myself to
[38:46] choose letters that were in symmetrical
[38:48] positions on my
[38:50] Cube now ultimately I did things a
[38:52] little more complicated than that yet
[38:54] but I don't think we have time to go
[38:55] into those details and besides it's they
[38:57] not relev to the first
[38:59] verse well how do you do that what I did
[39:02] is I took myself a piece of paper and I
[39:03] wrote the text out on it actually I took
[39:05] a piece of U really back Amon chips on
[39:08] the tabletop but the easiest way to see
[39:09] this is to think of these letters as on
[39:11] a string there little pearls on a string
[39:14] that you can push around and then I
[39:16] curled the string up such that the same
[39:18] letters came into relationship with each
[39:20] other and here it
[39:25] is he St start over here it's the first
[39:30] letter and you go around following this
[39:34] little curve this little
[39:37] coil these first three letters line up
[39:39] with their recurrence that's these three
[39:42] and these three they line up together
[39:46] there another sequence of
[39:47] three a t e a
[39:51] t
[39:53] well they're up here and likewise with
[39:57] all the others you'll notice that either
[39:59] the same letters are paired with each
[40:01] other or letters that are based three
[40:02] reciprocals on the cube in Mirror Image
[40:05] positions and when you do that the whole
[40:08] first verse lines up with itself letters
[40:09] that are colored the same are either the
[40:12] same letters or in the same symmetry
[40:14] group and what you'll notice about that
[40:16] pattern is it's extremely
[40:18] symmetrical all the letters are counted
[40:20] for and it's such a strong pattern that
[40:24] if any one letter were to have been lost
[40:25] or mistr transcribed
[40:28] over the centuries it could be uniquely
[40:30] replaced or corrected by reference only
[40:32] to the other letters in the same
[40:34] verse and that's true as you go through
[40:36] the text approximately one letter can
[40:39] can be corrected for each verse Le
[40:41] that's my my guess at this point the
[40:44] presence of an error correcting pattern
[40:45] is tantamount to demonstration that
[40:47] there's information it's real hard to
[40:49] correct something that doesn't have any
[40:50] meaning it's just don't go any place
[40:52] doing that well what is
[40:55] this well first
[40:58] the reason I started
[41:00] it here rather than on the edge
[41:03] someplace is because I realized this was
[41:06] on the surface of a dut which one can
[41:08] pull through and I didn't want these
[41:10] lines to cross over in funny ways so I
[41:12] simply rotated it through itself but if
[41:15] it were on the surface of a
[41:18] dut then that would all work as one one
[41:21] unit and so that's what the first verse
[41:24] of Genesis draws it draws a kind of dut
[41:28] called a two Taurus a two-dimensional
[41:31] surface on a
[41:32] Taurus as a matter of fact one can curl
[41:36] it up like this now remember when you
[41:38] get up to the top here it's as if you
[41:39] went through and started out at the
[41:40] bottom again this is as if this is on
[41:42] the surface of a
[41:43] donut I made it look like a chops
[41:48] pyramid for a couple of
[41:51] reasons if you have a cyclical
[41:54] pattern and it has a Eightfold
[41:59] Symmetry and seven turns then there's a
[42:02] measure angle that goes along with a
[42:04] function like that in mathematics called
[42:06] the Argon pole
[42:07] angle and it turns out to be the think
[42:11] it's the eth root of seven might be the
[42:12] seventh root of8 I forget now and that
[42:15] turns out turn out to be the tangent of
[42:16] the Chups pyramid angle Chups pyramid by
[42:19] the way is also called
[42:24] mirror and before the Muslims took the
[42:27] casing Stones off to build the mosque of
[42:29] Cairo about 7 or 800 years ago there
[42:32] were supposed to have been seven colored
[42:33] bands with writing painted on the on the
[42:36] side of the pyramid no one knows what
[42:37] that looked like but that's kind of
[42:40] suspicious now there's seven seven bands
[42:43] there and that's kind of interesting
[42:45] because Seven's a real important number
[42:47] in the religious world but in the
[42:49] mathematical world it's important too
[42:53] Donuts intrinsically have seven colored
[42:56] regions on on them turns out that if you
[42:59] want to make a map and you want adjacent
[43:01] countries to be different colors and you
[43:03] make your map on the surface of a table
[43:05] or a a sphere then you only need four
[43:08] different colors so that the adjacent
[43:10] colors adjacent countries are different
[43:11] colors if it's on a mobia strip a band
[43:14] with a half twist in it you need six
[43:17] colors on a donut you need seven colors
[43:21] never need more you can't get by with
[43:22] less and they're always on the same
[43:25] three turn spiral
[43:28] and we can go into some more detail on
[43:30] that maybe uh that later if we have a
[43:32] chance but you can think of a donut as
[43:35] seven regions seven little vectors
[43:37] chasing each other head to tail in a
[43:39] cycle and they go around three times
[43:41] they actually go through once so you
[43:42] might want to callot four times but
[43:44] there's no standard way to count
[43:46] that so we've now identified the first
[43:49] verse of Genesis it folds itself up into
[43:53] a
[43:53] donut this is the bagel theory of
[43:56] reality
[44:00] second verse is more complex um it also
[44:03] fits the same form but it's a lot longer
[44:05] and I didn't couldn't sketch it without
[44:06] making a terribly complicated drawing so
[44:08] I've left it out but in case you're
[44:11] wondering third verse does the same
[44:14] thing it's the third verse where God
[44:16] says let there be
[44:18] light and so it's appropriate to make a
[44:22] Candlestick a Manara seven Branch
[44:24] candlestick
[44:27] now that's looking down the coil here
[44:30] we're looking down the coil this way but
[44:32] here I've arranged it so it sort of laps
[44:34] on itself as you go around and again
[44:36] notice all the letters pair up this
[44:40] one's an odd letter but it's symmetrical
[44:42] with this other two that are in the same
[44:45] set in most cases the letters are
[44:47] completely doubled
[44:49] up
[44:52] and I have looked further into the text
[44:55] the patterns get complicated very
[44:56] quickly but there is evidence of that
[44:58] this kind of coding continues
[45:00] also but this isn't the
[45:03] really this isn't the the the densest
[45:05] pattern I could make and why do I want a
[45:07] denser pattern well let's go back and
[45:11] get a little context
[45:13] here we're told that Hebrew according to
[45:16] the Hebrew tradition was a universal
[45:18] language before the Tower of Babel that
[45:20] somehow there was an understanding of it
[45:21] that was
[45:22] Universal if you're going to do
[45:24] something that's Universal you have to
[45:26] pick the unque case in every instance if
[45:29] there's more than one one way to do
[45:31] something then it's not going to be
[45:33] Universal unless there's a Clear Choice
[45:35] the choice that mother nature makes that
[45:37] we've observed in doing our science is
[45:40] to take the most compact the most
[45:42] elegant the lowest order it's called
[45:43] aram's razor the idea is you don't want
[45:46] it to make a more complicated Theory
[45:48] than you need to and mother nature
[45:50] doesn't do that either nothing is wasted
[45:52] this pattern um has a lot of missing
[45:56] places where there aren't any letters
[45:58] other words if it's eight if it's
[45:59] Eightfold symmetry eight poles and seven
[46:01] turns there could be 56 letters on there
[46:03] 56 beads I'm only using 28 beads so only
[46:07] using half the spaces and even though
[46:09] this is sort of three-dimensional now
[46:11] it's really still on a Surface still
[46:13] kind of a flattish thing we live in a
[46:15] threedimensional reality so the idea
[46:17] would be maybe there's a more compact
[46:19] form of that first
[46:21] verus that might eliminate some of those
[46:23] empty spaces that might be a higher
[46:27] dimensional figure and there is let's
[46:30] see if I can find it put it there
[46:34] somewhere there it is up on top here it
[46:37] is over
[46:39] here if you were to arrange the first
[46:43] verse on a cube with a Vortex on each
[46:46] face of the
[46:49] cube actually just follow it around
[46:52] letters are all it actually starts here
[46:54] and comes up this way you'd find that
[46:57] opposite vortexes are mirror images of
[46:59] each
[47:00] other now there are still four spaces
[47:03] that are
[47:06] empty that simply implies if this is
[47:08] going to hold up that this is really a
[47:10] higher dimensional object and we're just
[47:11] still looking at this is the
[47:12] three-dimensional form maybe there's a
[47:13] four dimensional form which drops out
[47:15] those last four spaces how many letters
[47:17] in that first verse 28 letters in the
[47:19] first verse 27 followed by the 27th
[47:22] letter
[47:27] well that means that that first verse
[47:30] folds up into this object this is
[47:33] supposed to be a representation of that
[47:34] there's more than one way one can
[47:36] assemble it in fact it turns out this is
[47:38] a also a donut doesn't look like a dut
[47:42] let me show you why it's a donut the way
[47:44] you make a normal doughnut is you take a
[47:46] piece of paper a square typically make a
[47:48] square and you connect the left Edge to
[47:51] the right Edge and then you have a tube
[47:53] and you connect the top to the bottom
[47:55] and you would make a donut except I was
[47:57] wrinkle my paper if I did it that makes
[47:59] a donut in three dimensions called the
[48:01] tut Taurus if you wanted to make a donut
[48:03] in four dimensions you could take a cube
[48:07] and arrange it so as to connect this
[48:08] face to this and this face to this and
[48:12] this face to that and that would be a
[48:14] donut in four dimensions which we can't
[48:16] see except as Shadows so these are
[48:18] shadows well that's how this is arranged
[48:20] if you look through it this Vortex is
[48:23] the opposite of that one it's as if this
[48:25] was brought around and pasted onto here
[48:27] and this one is pasted onto there and
[48:29] that projective space of a dut in four
[48:33] dimensions and there's more than one
[48:35] projection of
[48:36] it here are two these are
[48:40] made of the same
[48:43] pieces but connected up slightly
[48:46] differently and that's the way one looks
[48:49] this is the way the other one looks
[48:56] put that back in
[49:00] holder we're going to get back to those
[49:02] in a minute when we talk about what
[49:03] these all
[49:05] represent so what have I found I found
[49:08] that the first verse of Genesis folds up
[49:10] into this
[49:12] flower maybe I should tell you what it
[49:14] is um one could call this a manura it's
[49:18] got a center point which seems to light
[49:20] six little vortices which look like
[49:22] Flames little Vortex looks like a flame
[49:27] where did the vortex come from oh well
[49:30] you just peel the seven color map off of
[49:32] the
[49:32] dut and you have a little
[49:35] Vortex this is the def definition of the
[49:37] donut you don't need the rest of the
[49:38] dough mathematicians don't need the
[49:40] dough they just want to know what the
[49:41] surface is you know how it all fits
[49:43] together don't Donuts is not good we'll
[49:46] get back to what that means in a
[49:50] minute well let me just just bring it
[49:53] down to to the result now so that I can
[49:55] talk talk about what are comes what it
[49:57] all means
[49:58] really this guy is six of these little
[50:01] Vortex Flames lit by a center
[50:04] one the energy comes in at the B at the
[50:07] initial b and goes out with that final Z
[50:11] they fit together to form a big Olive
[50:13] which is like the spin axis this is the
[50:15] only Corner that has spin symmetry if I
[50:18] tried to rotate it about any other point
[50:19] it wouldn't have the same full symmetry
[50:21] this has symmetry so it's as if there
[50:23] really is a vector going through the
[50:24] middle there really is a spin axis going
[50:25] through the middle
[50:28] and that's defined by that giant Olive
[50:30] that is the seventh Olive that's the day
[50:32] of rest there's a there's an A on every
[50:35] one of the vortexes and then there's a
[50:38] capital A a big a down the
[50:40] middle well if I lift off one of the
[50:42] vortexes and look at
[50:49] it you'll notice something about it it
[50:52] looks different from every way I hold it
[50:55] every way I can hold this Vortex it has
[50:58] a different
[51:00] Shadow here's a more accurately made one
[51:04] I'll tell you where what the shape is
[51:06] supposed to represent colors of the
[51:07] seven color map did the Ancients have
[51:10] the seven color map did they know the
[51:11] seven color map theorem not necessarily
[51:13] but they wouldn't have had to it's the
[51:15] same order of coloring as you see in a
[51:16] rainbow a rainbow is nothing but the Sun
[51:20] is up here and you're standing here an
[51:22] arc in the sky with red to Violet
[51:25] Spectrum on it also
[51:27] and those are the colors of the spectrum
[51:29] Why seven well there are a lot of other
[51:31] ways they could have come upon the seven
[51:32] as being intrinsic to this without
[51:33] having to know the seven color map
[51:35] theorem in our form but it turns out
[51:38] that when you look at this object from
[51:41] various different
[51:42] perspectives what you
[51:45] see are the letters of the Hebrew
[51:47] alphabet also letters of the Arabic
[51:49] alphabet and in a related form the
[51:52] double Vortex the Greek
[51:55] letters thank you an a there now you'll
[51:58] see an
[52:01] olive so what we have here these two
[52:06] columns are actual Shadow Gams of this
[52:11] model I did is I took the model pointed
[52:14] my TV camera at
[52:16] it and brought it up on a TV screen and
[52:20] made a tracing of it and then I photo
[52:22] reduced it so those are very
[52:25] accurate and they're all there and most
[52:27] of them are pretty good um it's not very
[52:30] convincing because they aren't
[52:33] necessarily in alphabetical order and
[52:34] that's important we haven't done that
[52:36] yet we need to do that on the computer
[52:38] although it is possible to peel off a
[52:40] third of the alphabet in alphabetical
[52:41] order by going around the figure but let
[52:43] me tell you what this what all this
[52:44] amounts to and why why it should be the
[52:46] basis of of a religious
[52:51] tradition what we have here is what I'm
[52:55] calling a geometric metaphor for
[52:57] Spiritual
[53:00] Transcendence what the Ancients seem to
[53:03] have done is they seem to have come up
[53:05] with a sequence of geometric
[53:07] objects that represents an embryonic
[53:11] process represents the way a
[53:15] seed blossoms into a flower until it
[53:18] throws off a new
[53:24] seed the idea is that these objects are
[53:29] parts of this embryonic
[53:32] process there's two parts to each object
[53:36] there is a structural part A framework
[53:40] like the seed like a shell like the
[53:42] husk and there is
[53:45] a an unfolding part like the tree itself
[53:49] you know where did this come from how do
[53:52] how did this all happen how do they do
[53:54] it what does it mean to them
[54:02] if you want to make an alphabet you want
[54:04] to make a language a technical alphabet
[54:07] which maybe have later been adopted for
[54:09] phonetic use that's going to be based on
[54:13] on
[54:14] life then there's one most important
[54:17] characteristic of a living system of
[54:19] anything that's alive and that is that
[54:21] it
[54:22] propagates oak trees grow from acorns
[54:26] Acorn oak tree Acorn oak tree forever
[54:28] chicken and egg chicken and egg forever
[54:30] life is an infinite recursive
[54:33] chain
[54:34] um they it it extends forever you could
[54:38] you could
[54:39] [Music]
[54:43] start with a little seed and they and a
[54:47] tree always grows from it and it throws
[54:48] off another seed and another tree grows
[54:50] and another seed and another tree grows
[54:52] and all these trees are reaching for the
[54:54] for the Sun up on top and they're all
[54:56] rooted in the earth and this chain
[54:59] extends conceptually forever as a matter
[55:02] of fact the idea of the one
[55:06] God can be understood in this
[55:08] sense if you want to know where God is
[55:11] you can look into the tip of an acorn
[55:13] conceptually down through the acorn into
[55:16] its oak tree and down through the oak
[55:18] tree into its Acorn all the way back to
[55:21] creation and that would be the right
[55:22] direction to
[55:25] look and that's what's being modeled
[55:28] here I want to read you a quotation from
[55:32] the introduction to the
[55:34] Zohar which is one of the chief Works in
[55:38] calistic Tradition this is the very
[55:40] beginning of it this is the
[55:42] introduction it's called The
[55:44] Lily says the students of Rabbi Shimon
[55:48] were assembled together sitting in
[55:49] silence waiting for the master to begin
[55:51] his discourse at length Rabbi Shimon
[55:53] spoke and said as a lily among the Thor
[55:57] horns this Lily what does it symbolize
[56:00] it symbolizes the congregation of
[56:02] Israel the Lily has 13 leaves
[56:05] surrounding it on all sides what in the
[56:08] world does that
[56:10] mean for this reason the Lily symbolizes
[56:12] the cup of
[56:15] blessing as there are five words between
[56:17] the second and third elim mentioned in
[56:20] the Book of Genesis God name one of
[56:22] these words is ur meaning light this
[56:25] light was Tre Ed and became enclosed as
[56:28] an
[56:29] embryo in the Covenant and entering into
[56:32] the lily as a principle of Life made it
[56:34] fruitful and this is what is called in
[56:36] scripture fruit tree yielding fruit
[56:39] whose seed is in
[56:41] itself and as this life principle
[56:43] entering into the Covenant caused itself
[56:45] to become manifested in 42 kinds of
[56:47] second matter so it has produced the 42
[56:50] letter name of
[56:53] God what does this got to do with
[56:55] anything
[57:00] well let me identify this object for you
[57:05] told you it was like a
[57:07] manur it's also
[57:13] like many other things that have been
[57:15] mentioned in sacred literature it's got
[57:18] a globular top to it it's got a
[57:23] stem sort of twisted up
[57:26] might be the gordian knot cut by
[57:28] Alexander's sword or maybe it's the
[57:31] Grail cup cut by the sword of
[57:34] Linus I think it might very well
[57:37] be it sits
[57:40] symmetrically inside this
[57:43] object you see every Vortex could be on
[57:46] a square face and every corner would be
[57:48] on a triangular
[57:50] face and this object Buckminster fullest
[57:53] vector equilibrium has 12
[57:56] spheres 12 Corners to it and there's
[57:59] room in the middle for a center sphere
[58:01] it's like a 13 petal
[58:04] rows and the Lily this is a field of
[58:07] Lies after all if you were to look at a
[58:10] caily looks sort of like a calil another
[58:13] name for this
[58:13] [Music]
[58:16] object it would be growing through this
[58:18] framework and that's what I'm showing
[58:21] over
[58:22] here that there is a framework a
[58:25] structure there 13 petal rows and
[58:28] through it grow these vortices these
[58:31] Cales these flowers these
[58:35] Flames between the center sphere and the
[58:37] spheros sphere there is this field of
[58:40] Lies sort of like little wavicles little
[58:44] photons between different orbital levels
[58:46] of an electron wave particle
[58:52] duality and
[58:54] so this object seems to fit the
[58:56] beginning
[58:57] descriptions what are the
[58:59] 42 turns out if you were to
[59:02] pack 12 little spheres around a cent
[59:06] sphere ging 13 you would make another
[59:09] layer if You' to keep opening up the
[59:13] system layer by layer by layer the next
[59:16] layer would have 42
[59:20] spheres it's the only geometric object
[59:23] that has that quality of one surrounded
[59:25] by 12 surrounded by 42 so it's clearly
[59:28] what is being discussed and it's an
[59:31] embryonic process because it's showing
[59:34] how a seed unfurls into this whole
[59:38] system and then starts over
[59:41] again now I want to start from one other
[59:44] one other place to give you an idea of
[59:46] how this fits together because I want to
[59:47] I want to say some more about the
[59:49] language and what its meaning might be
[59:51] and how we're deriving it and I think
[59:53] we're beginning to have a Time problem
[59:55] anyway
[59:59] let's talk about sort of
[60:03] Creation in physics these days creation
[60:06] starts with the false
[60:07] vacuum and then the forces sort of
[60:10] settle out of it you get gravitation you
[60:12] get you get the strong force and you get
[60:14] eventually the electro weak force and
[60:16] electricity
[60:20] Etc if you start with a universe that is
[60:24] an infinite sea of cosmic yellow uniform
[60:27] in all directions
[60:29] transparent you try to make a
[60:31] distinction in
[60:33] it this this first distinction between
[60:35] inside and outside would be nice you
[60:38] can't do it easily if you carve a
[60:40] balloon out of jello in a sea of jello
[60:44] and that's full of Jell-O because that's
[60:46] all there is you haven't got any
[60:48] distinction it's just
[60:50] Jello-O but if you
[60:53] do something anything any disturbance in
[60:56] the sea of jello compared to what was
[60:58] there before it would be an infinite
[61:01] disturbance
[61:04] poof fat
[61:06] Lux when you go poof in the jello the
[61:09] jello starts to fall through itself
[61:12] forms a smoke ring blow up little smoke
[61:15] ring in the air and the Smoke Ring falls
[61:17] through itself it's the lowest order
[61:19] self-referential form and it separates
[61:22] what's outside of the smoke ring from
[61:24] what's inside the Smoke Ring and you can
[61:26] always detect a smoke ring by virtue of
[61:28] the fact that the smoke is
[61:29] circulating it's this Dynamic quality
[61:32] that enables you to make a
[61:36] distinction and so the smoke
[61:39] ring is the lowest order self-
[61:42] referential form it's a topology of
[61:44] falling through itself Ezekiel calls it
[61:46] a wheel of wheels and
[61:48] it takes seven colors to map this this
[61:52] this this smoke ring
[61:56] now in order to produce a
[61:58] self-referential system like this it
[61:59] turns out mathematically you need four
[62:01] logical points four logical States and I
[62:04] don't think we can go into details on
[62:06] that but um if you want to know why
[62:08] there is a four cycle required to make a
[62:10] seven cycle I would recommend the works
[62:12] of Arthur Young reflexive universe and
[62:15] many others four logical states form a
[62:19] logical structure like a
[62:22] tetrahedron little tetrahedron for our
[62:25] orange logical
[62:28] States and the tetrahedron most people
[62:31] think
[62:32] of as having only four spin axes of spin
[62:39] symmetry but in fact if you also look
[62:42] through the middle of the tetrahedron
[62:44] from edge to edge you can rotate it on
[62:47] three more
[62:48] axes which is what these are the four
[62:52] yellow axes are axes of spin Symmetry
[62:55] and symmetry is the important thing to
[62:58] physicist and also you've got three
[63:00] additional axes these purple ones that
[63:03] you can also rotate the figure through
[63:05] so you can think of a tetrahedron as a
[63:08] radial pack of seven vectors and you can
[63:11] think of a Vortex a donut as a cyclical
[63:14] array of seven vectors CH chasing each
[63:19] other this one is structural I'm sorry
[63:22] this one is structural this one is like
[63:23] process this is like the acorn in this
[63:25] is like the oak
[63:27] tree and they cefine each
[63:30] other the circulation through the
[63:34] axle is defined by the explosion of that
[63:37] point into the Ring of three points and
[63:40] the circulation around the tire tread is
[63:42] the cyclic circulation of the three
[63:44] points on
[63:46] top this one can't be compressed and
[63:50] this one can't fly apart as long as the
[63:51] dissipator flux flows through it this
[63:54] one is
[63:56] this one is structural and so we end up
[64:00] with if I can find the right chart right
[64:03] in front of me here a kind of mixture of
[64:07] these two objects which are related to
[64:10] each other tetrahedron and the vortex
[64:13] they both are seven objects but they're
[64:16] arrayed
[64:17] differently I could search for the quote
[64:19] but I think because time is fleeting
[64:21] I'll just tell you um the cabalistic
[64:22] tradition teaches that Unity which is
[64:26] identified with
[64:27] God exists when the flame is wedded to
[64:30] the
[64:33] coal another phrase that shows up in the
[64:35] Old Testament a lot is the so-called
[64:37] light in the meeting tent tent of
[64:40] communion you think about it these two
[64:43] objects are just about the most
[64:45] archetypal objects you could ever come
[64:47] up with I don't know of any child that
[64:50] hasn't stared into a candle flame that's
[64:51] flickering and just about every
[64:53] tradition considers that flickering
[64:55] flame to be somehow comparable to
[64:59] Consciousness light and Consciousness
[65:00] are identified with each other again
[65:02] Arthur Young turns talks about how a
[65:04] photon has choice of what direction it
[65:06] comes off in and that corresponds to
[65:08] conscious Choice it's the unit of action
[65:10] the Quantum of action in
[65:14] physics and most folks particularly in
[65:18] the olden time used to um cook their
[65:20] food around a tripod of sticks called a
[65:23] campfire or spend the night in a pup t
[65:25] or tent so little tetrahedral tent a
[65:29] little flame are common to all of our
[65:31] Consciousness in all
[65:34] traditions and they they can be
[65:37] understood as having these kind of dual
[65:39] qualities
[65:42] these qualities of lack of symmetry
[65:45] every way you look at this figure it
[65:46] looks different there are an infinite
[65:48] number of views and this figure which
[65:49] has extreme symmetry tetrahedron has has
[65:52] really extreme symmetry I could also use
[65:54] a cube but the lowest order the most
[65:56] elegant object of symmetry is the
[65:58] tetrahedron so that's the universal the
[66:01] one to
[66:02] pck um there is an oracle talked about
[66:05] in Mosaic times called the urum in the
[66:08] thumin also mentioned by the Mormons is
[66:10] used to translate their Golden Plates no
[66:13] one knows what they are they're supposed
[66:14] to be a something related to the 12
[66:18] jewels on the breastplate of the high
[66:19] priest whatever that might mean if you
[66:22] had a solid tetrahedron of course and
[66:24] you looked inside of it you'd see three
[66:26] Reflections on each of the four faces
[66:28] and so they would be like 12
[66:30] Jewels 12 sparkling ways to look at
[66:34] it and that was used as an oracle to
[66:36] interpret the
[66:38] text in the Greek
[66:41] Traditions the Oracle of Deli to
[66:45] interpret what text the the um Torah
[66:47] text the Genesis text there was other
[66:49] there were other uses too it's also used
[66:50] just as an oracle the first paragraph
[66:55] the the whole
[66:57] thing the Oracle Deli sat you sat on a
[67:01] tripod the Oracle sat on a tripod and
[67:02] around the tripod was python the snake
[67:04] well here's
[67:06] Python and so the Oracle of Delphi takes
[67:10] the same form the same geometric
[67:12] metaphor and again I'm I'm saying that
[67:14] this is basically um this is the
[67:17] Consciousness this is the mind this is
[67:19] body this is Yin this is yang this is
[67:21] feminine and masculine wave and particle
[67:24] analog and discreet it also looks like a
[67:26] root a dragon a serpent um the
[67:29] tetrahedron is related to a vessel or a
[67:32] shell or a nut in in metaphorical use in
[67:34] the in the texts when one plugs these
[67:37] meanings which I'm going to tell you
[67:40] about in more detail into the cabalistic
[67:43] texts they don't read
[67:47] like poetry anymore they read much more
[67:50] like uid like like a very logical
[67:52] geometrical system I'll give you an
[67:54] example
[67:56] uh if I can find it
[67:59] quickly maybe I can't find it quickly so
[68:01] I'm not going to bother with
[68:04] that well here's here's an interesting
[68:06] example this is from Gregory vos's um
[68:08] book called Plato's Universe where he
[68:10] talks about Plato considering that the
[68:13] fiery part of the wick would therefore
[68:16] consist of a string of
[68:18] tetrahedr the flame and the tetrahedra
[68:21] are thought of as as being together in
[68:23] the Greek tradition as well as in the
[68:25] Hebrew
[68:27] see if I can find let's let that
[68:31] go
[68:34] um by the way the alphabets here are
[68:36] rinic alphabets from the Islamic period
[68:38] in
[68:39] Spain and that's also the same period
[68:42] where the Arabic letters match the form
[68:44] too um I think that
[68:47] the the so-called sacred forms on top
[68:49] are stylizations of these that had to be
[68:52] added when the model was lost to
[68:54] maintain distinctions between letters
[68:55] that would otherwise look very much
[68:57] alike that you couldn't distinguish
[68:59] between certain letters without the
[69:00] model and so that they had to have these
[69:03] stylizations but look there's something
[69:05] peculiar about all these
[69:07] letters there are decorations on nine of
[69:10] the letters which I've indicated in
[69:12] purple called tagin Crown lets they come
[69:15] in little Triple
[69:19] Crowns if you take the form that the
[69:22] first verse of Genesis makes
[69:26] and since it has these three ears on it
[69:31] you can see it a little
[69:33] better here where I've colored them
[69:35] three different
[69:36] colors there's this 13 petal rows Cub
[69:39] deedin vector equilibrium in the middle
[69:41] and there's a Vortex coming out of each
[69:43] face and each of the three are different
[69:45] you can start out they sort of start out
[69:47] as these little
[69:49] Loops what are they how how does this
[69:52] really happen well here's our
[69:54] tetrahedron here's our c
[69:55] this is the the lowest order symmetrical
[69:57] object in three
[69:59] dimensions tetrahedron is what happens
[70:02] when you take a line and you pull it
[70:03] apart and rotate it at the same
[70:06] time so you have the two corners my two
[70:09] fists and my two elbows make the
[70:10] tetrahedr make the corners of the
[70:12] tetrahedron this way and this way here
[70:15] to
[70:19] here and so if you
[70:21] trace the fact that these opposite edges
[70:24] are Rota ating against each other and
[70:27] follow that rotation and link them up
[70:28] you get this propeller shape that's
[70:30] where it comes from now how do we get
[70:33] from here to here well what you have to
[70:37] to realize is that both of these systems
[70:40] of forms expand at the same time the
[70:44] tetrahedron becomes these
[70:47] other platonic solids regular and
[70:49] semi-regular solids and the vortex forms
[70:53] unfurl with it it's sort of like a
[70:55] flower
[70:56] unfurling if you take a
[70:59] tetrahedron and you just extend its
[71:01] Corners a little
[71:06] bit bringing it up into a higher
[71:08] dimensional State and you keep doing
[71:11] that here I've extended the corners and
[71:13] I put little edges on them and then this
[71:16] orange tetrahedron becomes very small
[71:18] the cabala says the arms of the universe
[71:20] extend to Infinity so we make the
[71:22] diagonal directions very long there's 12
[71:24] of them and up with this form this is
[71:27] what I'm doing up here do you believe
[71:29] that that's a
[71:34] tetrahedron and as that unfurls it
[71:37] becomes this
[71:39] form you see how it fits the Triangular
[71:41] faces are the triangles these bifurcated
[71:44] edges become the square faces and so the
[71:47] tetrahedron literally grows into the
[71:49] Cubo
[71:51] dihedron the cuboctahedron as Fuller
[71:54] points out
[71:56] jitterbugs by itself it comes up from
[71:59] the octahedron to the
[72:01] icosahedron and this is a kind of
[72:03] verticular motion in itself so as the
[72:06] platonic solids
[72:10] unfurl the flame
[72:15] unfurls and then if we put the alphabet
[72:19] on the form that the first verse draws
[72:21] this is going to get interesting now
[72:23] we've got a a text folds itself up into
[72:26] an object it's written in an alphabet
[72:29] the alphabet has decorations on it we
[72:31] put the alphabet on the form that the
[72:34] first verse makes in alphabetical
[72:36] order following it around in
[72:38] alphabetical
[72:40] order these little decorations line up
[72:44] in the
[72:45] corners there is one decoration on one
[72:48] corner there are two on the next three
[72:51] on the third and there zero opposite
[72:53] three on the remaining corner
[72:55] they specify a tetrahedral coordinate
[72:59] system 1 2 3 and a spin axis it tells
[73:04] you how to hold the figure you need to
[73:06] know how to hold it if you're going to
[73:07] make letters from
[73:10] it it's taught that these
[73:13] decorations somehow contain the secret
[73:15] of redeeming the alphabet and no one
[73:17] knows what they're there
[73:18] for and I don't know of any other
[73:21] Arrangement that shows what their
[73:22] meaning might be and the thing is they
[73:24] look just like the corners of the
[73:26] tetrahedron actually
[73:30] looks not only that but if there really
[73:34] were little spheres on these Corner
[73:38] points then the little decorations would
[73:42] look precisely as they're drawn three
[73:44] little points with a sphere on each on
[73:45] each
[73:48] corner and so the decorations really do
[73:50] redeem the Alphabet by creating the
[73:52] coordinate system that tells you how you
[73:53] can make the alphabet
[73:55] so here we have a
[73:57] text that folds itself up into a form
[74:01] that casts Shadows which are the letters
[74:04] that the text is written
[74:06] in I would call that self-referential I
[74:08] would call that
[74:10] self-embedded and
[74:12] self-referential self-awareness is what
[74:14] distinguishes us from the other animals
[74:17] it's self-aware creatures that we're
[74:19] attempting to communicate
[74:20] with when the Bible says that we are
[74:23] made in the image of God it doesn't mean
[74:26] except for a few religious sexs which I
[74:28] hope I'm not insulting it doesn't mean
[74:29] that we look like God most people don't
[74:31] think God looks like
[74:34] me you think right you all agree to that
[74:37] don't you okay maybe Johnny Carson maybe
[74:40] maybe George Burns but but not me no the
[74:44] image is that we are self-aware and we
[74:47] presume God is self-aware we presume
[74:49] folks living outer space are
[74:51] self-aware some of the higher animals
[74:53] are self-aware Coco the gorilla
[74:54] certainly seems to be self-aware some of
[74:56] the elephants and and dolphins and and
[74:59] gorillas are likely to be self-aware we
[75:02] would like to build an artificial
[75:03] intelligence like R2-D2 or C3PO that
[75:06] would be
[75:07] self-aware um this is a
[75:10] universal language for self-aware
[75:14] creatures because self-awareness is also
[75:18] the study of oneself if you have a
[75:20] society of self-aware creatures they
[75:22] will by definition study themselves in
[75:24] the people who study themselves in
[75:26] society are called philosophers and the
[75:27] philosophers will study philosophers who
[75:29] study philosophers who study
[75:30] philosophers and that infinite recursive
[75:32] chain of philosophers who study
[75:35] philosophers um is the same chain as the
[75:38] chain of acorns and oak trees acorns and
[75:41] oak trees going on
[75:43] forever and so whether you're looking at
[75:45] the self-propagating quality of living
[75:48] systems or the self-aware quality of the
[75:51] creatures who are looking at the
[75:52] self-propagating quality of living
[75:53] systems um you get the same form a
[75:57] self-organizing
[75:58] form
[76:01] um what do it organized itself into
[76:06] well let's take a couple of these guys
[76:08] and let them self organize by pairing
[76:10] them off you pair them off you get what
[76:13] look like little animal
[76:17] heads there are four of them if I don't
[76:19] drop
[76:20] them and what do they
[76:23] represent now this is where we're going
[76:24] to get interesting oh by the way um I
[76:26] was giving this talk in in Jerusalem a
[76:28] couple years ago actually an earlier
[76:29] version of it and a rabbi got up and he
[76:31] was quite agitated he said um do you
[76:35] need to tell me that Rabbi nak
[76:38] manes in the 11th century in Portugal
[76:42] had your model in front of him when he
[76:44] made up to the alphabet he wrote in he
[76:46] said well as a matter of fact there is
[76:48] one object that one can expect rabbis to
[76:52] have so I held up
[76:55] Rams
[77:02] [Music]
[77:03] Horn well you know I
[77:06] mean what can you say
[77:10] um let's go a little further um if you
[77:15] look up the word
[77:16] Apollo in your dictionary you'll find it
[77:19] means a poon a means not and palon is
[77:23] cinate to our word full PL or P and F
[77:26] are the same full meaning many Apen
[77:30] meaning not many meaning one Amon and a
[77:32] unit their one god Apollo is said to be
[77:36] the Archer of the
[77:38] sun well the center point be it here or
[77:43] here is called sheemish the sun god in
[77:46] Babylonian shamish the lighting candle
[77:48] in Hebrew the candle that lights the
[77:53] manora if one word to also check Robert
[77:56] Graves one would find that Apollo also
[77:59] meant I'm looking for a model which is
[78:01] evading my face at the moment um also
[78:04] means Apple if one slices Apollo cognate
[78:09] to Apple if one slices through the
[78:10] middle of an apple one finds a star of
[78:13] seeds in the
[78:14] middle surrounded by the peeled apple
[78:20] skin this is the star and crescent of
[78:22] Islam this is the sign of the Covenant
[78:24] the bow in the sky sky is the star the
[78:27] bow is around
[78:28] it Apollo is called the Archer of the
[78:32] Sun and he's an
[78:34] apple well here's an apple I spin it
[78:38] maybe you can see that this is peeled
[78:39] off of an apple and there's the star of
[78:41] seeds in the middle and from the stem to
[78:44] the flower end of the Apple there is a
[78:46] spin symmetry axis down the middle of
[78:48] the Apple which is also the form of a
[78:51] Tut tourus a fruit is the fruition of
[78:54] the embryonic process after all and if
[78:57] one looks down the middle
[78:59] of the Apple the spin axis goes through
[79:04] the
[79:05] sun this is an apple Apollo is the
[79:08] Archer of the
[79:10] sun if you look through any of these
[79:12] figures down the middle you'll also see
[79:13] a heart shape that the arrow pierces so
[79:17] we have an apple with a heart in the
[79:18] middle pierced by an arrow or a sword
[79:25] Happy Valentine's
[79:27] Day no one knows where the heart symbol
[79:29] comes from by the way now if you think
[79:32] this is fanciful it's a little book by a
[79:36] mathematician from I think Cambridge or
[79:38] Oxford or some such place called field
[79:41] of form where he talks about generating
[79:44] the shape of all kinds of
[79:48] fruit all kinds of
[79:52] buds and more buds
[79:56] and also the heart muscle in seven wound
[80:00] layers all in an invariant
[80:05] tetrahedron the words the param the
[80:08] parameters of generating these budding
[80:10] forms all can be determined from an
[80:12] invariant tetrahedron so there really is
[80:14] a tetrahedron or a cube which is a
[80:16] double tetrahedron here's a double
[80:19] tetrahedron two tetrahedron through each
[80:21] other forms a
[80:22] cube around an apple around the
[80:28] fruit and so we have a model
[80:34] of a seed with little DNA inside if
[80:37] you'd like and it grows into a
[80:42] fruit which has a seed inside of it
[80:45] remember the zor says fruit tree
[80:47] yielding fruit whose seed is in
[80:49] itself and so this is a mo a model of
[80:52] the fruition of that seed it's what it
[80:56] grows into and it's identified with
[81:00] Valentine's heart with a William tell's
[81:04] Apple if you'd like with
[81:07] Apollo you look at one section of
[81:10] this it's kisman it's a symbol
[81:14] identifying Christ in Christian
[81:17] tradition if you look at the most
[81:21] common stained glass window
[81:24] so-called Rose window occurs in
[81:26] synagogues and churches and
[81:29] mosques most people assume that these
[81:31] yellow leaves are the leaves of the
[81:33] six-sided shushan
[81:34] flower shushan is the name of six-sided
[81:38] flower this is
[81:42] flat but in fact what's really going on
[81:45] is you've got a cube with a Vortex on
[81:47] each face and you're looking down the
[81:49] tip of
[81:49] it and so that's the shadow of this
[81:53] think of each of the ores as these
[81:56] guys and there's of course six and there
[82:00] one each on each face of the six faces
[82:02] of the cube so this very common
[82:04] drawing in all
[82:06] Traditions is really just a
[82:08] two-dimensional projection of this apple
[82:13] this Grail Cup this philosopher stone
[82:15] this gordian knot this apple this Apollo
[82:19] Apple now this Center Point this is
[82:21] Apollo the Pagan Sun God to the
[82:24] peasantry in Grace but that the
[82:26] philosophers they recognized that that
[82:28] Sun Center was not an ordinary Sun
[82:30] Center they're calling it a God would
[82:32] have been like our calling it a fountain
[82:36] I have some quotes on that too which I
[82:37] don't think I have time to get to it's a
[82:39] recursive Fountain it's again looking
[82:41] into this Acorn into the oak tree into
[82:43] the acorn into the oak tree into the
[82:44] acorn all the way back to the Sun or to
[82:46] God depending on the metaphor you're
[82:48] using Sun being a metaphor for God the
[82:51] Sun s thought of as an event horizon
[82:55] like an acorn
[82:58] is show you a little cute thing here too
[83:01] she I didn't bring you the Greek letters
[83:02] along but if you recognize that that's
[83:04] the same as the Hebrew letter
[83:07] B you'll recognize that as the Greek
[83:09] letter
[83:12] B all right let me sum some of this up
[83:15] and I want to get to one main point
[83:16] because otherwise um I'm going to not be
[83:18] able to finish it all of the things on
[83:20] this table are one one model they all
[83:22] unfurl from each other they map an EMB I
[83:24] IC process what does this have to do
[83:26] with
[83:28] Consciousness well let's pick up the
[83:30] little letter again this is the element
[83:32] of generat the
[83:33] letters I could use this as a kind of
[83:35] pointer you see I could Point any
[83:37] direction I wanted to with this as if I
[83:40] had a shaft down the spin axis and it
[83:42] was a little arrow head if I was
[83:44] standing on the on the globe of the
[83:46] earth and walking around and this was me
[83:49] my Consciousness my life that was
[83:51] modeled by this flame then my feet to my
[83:53] head direction would point point in all
[83:54] kinds of directions in three dimensions
[83:57] and then I could rotate and and and look
[84:00] in in in any number of directions from
[84:01] any
[84:03] position well every time I did that if
[84:05] you were looking at me you'd see a
[84:06] different
[84:07] letter the letters represent
[84:10] perspectives of this object As you move
[84:12] around
[84:14] it then what's a sacred text consisting
[84:17] of a string of these
[84:19] letters it's kind of the
[84:21] directions for following a kind of path
[84:24] step by step each letter rotates
[84:28] you or rotates this object in your
[84:31] mind's
[84:34] eye let redo a couple of quotations here
[84:39] this one is from an old Science News
[84:41] where dri Thompson is reporting
[84:45] on conference in quantum theory and
[84:48] gravitation they're searching for a
[84:50] universal language for
[84:52] physics and they end up suggesting that
[84:55] Clifford algebra should be used as a
[84:57] universal language for physics because
[84:59] it's a language
[85:01] of manipulation and
[85:04] directions called Spinners really in
[85:07] physics little unit directions little
[85:09] unit spins in hyperspace elements of of
[85:12] einsteinian
[85:14] SpaceTime here's another quote another
[85:17] diagram actually sorry this is from um
[85:21] Robert John and Brenda Dunn's book on
[85:23] quantum mechanics of Consciousness where
[85:25] they're talking about mapping points of
[85:27] conscious focus on
[85:30] a basically on a spherical coordinate
[85:35] system I believe that understood
[85:39] appropriately this little object and
[85:41] these letters represent directions in
[85:43] SpaceTime and directions in conscious
[85:46] focus and to be taken on a little trip
[85:49] of one to another to another point of
[85:51] conscious focus is to be taken on a
[85:53] little internal meditation of dance
[85:55] little yogic
[85:58] path if that
[86:01] sequence led to a transcendental
[86:04] experience then that would be a sacred
[86:06] text if one had a yogic dance or our
[86:11] mental exercise of meditation that one
[86:13] wanted to record for posterity that if
[86:17] one could perform it would
[86:18] produce an initiatory a baptismal a
[86:21] near-death an out of Body Experience
[86:23] whatever you want to call it
[86:24] then this would be a way to record that
[86:27] now I can't show that that's what really
[86:28] happened here um until we can identify a
[86:31] particular direction with each letter
[86:33] and do it analytically obviously in
[86:35] computer simulation we can't reconstruct
[86:38] the path so we can't verify if this is
[86:40] true but there's a lot of evidence that
[86:42] something like this is going on so
[86:45] that's that's sort of the significance
[86:46] of this um both mathematicians and
[86:51] meditating rabbis report that if you
[86:54] turn over a hyperdimensional object or a
[86:57] three-dimensional object in a
[86:58] hyperdimensional space in your mind that
[87:00] is the equivalent of a meditative
[87:02] experience that does evoke an experience
[87:05] and so it looks like this geometric
[87:07] metaphor if you can understand it if you
[87:09] can follow it if you can allow these
[87:10] forms to Blossom in your own mind if you
[87:13] can look at these views of the flame
[87:17] which I don't know how many of you
[87:19] looking at these sequence of shapes
[87:21] would realize they were all Shadows of
[87:22] one object
[87:24] but if you can interpolate in your mind
[87:26] the intermediate shape between these two
[87:29] if you can rotate this in your mind's
[87:31] eye you can do that
[87:33] meditation then you might have an
[87:35] experience and I would suggest people
[87:36] try it I can't tell you what will happen
[87:39] with you um I know that these are
[87:41] powerful invocative figures for me
[87:44] that's where they came
[87:45] from
[87:47] um let me look at my notes and see if
[87:49] there's anything I really wanted to say
[87:51] because I can see we're running out of
[87:52] time
[87:55] maybe I should go over these drawings a
[87:57] little more cover anything I didn't yeah
[87:59] let me just make a few quick points in
[88:01] the cabalistic tradition they say that
[88:03] there three letters that are mother
[88:04] letters and they never give a reason
[88:05] it's in sephra yir book of formation
[88:08] they say the letters are Olive men and
[88:09] shin am
[88:10] ands the only letters adjacent to the
[88:13] center point in the Genesis pattern are
[88:16] this Olive these two olives this s and
[88:19] this m which could be slid in and so
[88:22] this figure validates the discussion of
[88:24] the three mother letters um this is how
[88:28] a tetrahedron would unfurl
[88:31] fractally and that's what's really going
[88:33] on here it's like any other living
[88:34] system it keeps propagating on itself so
[88:37] not only does this little tetrahedron
[88:39] make for tetrahedr but each of these
[88:40] makes more and it keeps growing again it
[88:43] would be lovely to do that on the
[88:44] computer
[88:46] sometime um oh I wanted to mention this
[88:50] these 12 points 12 spheres that surround
[88:53] this 13 petal rose that this shushan
[88:55] flower grows through by the way now we
[88:57] know why the first word is translated
[89:00] barah sheet created six or created a
[89:04] thorn here are the six and there was the
[89:08] thorn this is a unifying model the
[89:11] Divergent translations to the first
[89:13] verse if you have these models all mean
[89:16] the same
[89:17] thing the war on the academic Scholars
[89:21] had between Apollo meaning an apple and
[89:22] Apollo meaning not many is resolved by
[89:25] the one apple the model satisfies both
[89:30] discussions um let me think if there's
[89:32] anything else oh I did want to do these
[89:34] if you take the little little Vortex
[89:35] forms and you double them
[89:38] up this a mirror image and remember
[89:40] there's seven principal views you have
[89:43] what looks to this
[89:46] non-expert as seven postures
[89:49] corresponding to seven
[89:51] chakras those are like yogic meditation
[89:54] postures they look a little like a yogi
[89:56] sitting there meditating I that guy's
[89:57] levitating
[89:59] already
[90:01] um this has just been touching the
[90:04] surface I'm I'm really feeling a little
[90:05] bit like I've bitten off more than I
[90:07] could Che here because I haven't been
[90:09] able to show you
[90:12] everything oh wait this is important
[90:15] this is important I started to show you
[90:16] how these guys
[90:18] self-organized they fit together they
[90:20] can obviously be clustered together to
[90:23] form these ball-shaped objects by the
[90:26] way this is interesting to mention too
[90:28] one of them looks like an apple you see
[90:30] the stem see the globe the Apple the
[90:33] other one is kind of a flatted sphere I
[90:35] call it a
[90:36] fig fig and apple when one becomes
[90:38] self-aware one puts on the Fig Leaf the
[90:41] word fig in Hebrew is cognate to the
[90:42] word I am it's the fruit of the tree of
[90:45] the I am tree the tree of
[90:47] self-awareness except if one attempts to
[90:49] line up the little
[90:52] decorations on the Apple they come out
[90:55] 222 an indistinct unusable coordinate
[90:58] system on the Fig two3 the Fig generates
[91:03] continues to propagate the Apple dies
[91:05] off that I believe is why the apple is
[91:08] associated with evil because it is a
[91:11] dead end path mathematically after the
[91:14] bifurcation into these two forms one
[91:16] dies off and the other continues to
[91:18] propagate the living one is the Fig
[91:20] shape so it explains why apples have a
[91:23] bad name but by the way you can consider
[91:24] a The Vortex to be the serpent in the
[91:27] Apple
[91:29] goodbye the other thing that these
[91:31] things fit together to form if one
[91:33] connects them in a long
[91:36] chain DNA Tetra Buckman Fuller's tetrah
[91:40] Helix model of
[91:42] DNA the interesting thing
[91:44] is that there were 22 faces to one
[91:48] module of
[91:50] DNA the old Canaanite alphabet had 22
[91:53] letters
[91:54] there are 27 symmetry elements to the
[91:58] globular form the new alphabet has 27
[92:00] letters the conversion between the old
[92:03] and new alphabet which would have been
[92:04] Unthinkable if the alphabets were
[92:06] different is legitimate because the two
[92:08] alphabets excuse me are transformations
[92:11] of each
[92:11] other in fact it may turn out that they
[92:14] correspond to the 27 lines on the
[92:18] general cubic
[92:20] surface and the 21 vertices and the
[92:23] center point
[92:25] maybe not but it seems intriguing well
[92:28] I've got some people know a little more
[92:29] math than I am trying to help me figure
[92:30] that that if that's legitimate let's see
[92:32] maybe I should let people ask questions
[92:34] because I I really don't know how far
[92:36] I've gotten with this I sort of got lost
[92:38] and we could also turn this on and make
[92:39] it look pretty if we turn the lights
[92:42] out um questions applic well the
[92:46] applications that well with the
[92:49] applications this is a self-organizing
[92:51] system I didn't get to discuss it their
[92:53] applic ations potentially with for
[92:55] self-organizing systems and artificial
[92:58] intelligence um these geometric models
[93:01] are common to the various religious
[93:03] faiths that are at one time or another
[93:05] at war with each other I think it would
[93:07] help people respect each other if they
[93:09] realized that the models were
[93:11] common um geometric metaphor is
[93:14] currently unrecognized in the talmid
[93:15] it's unrecognized in the cabalistic
[93:17] tradition most of the translators of
[93:19] calistic material take it to be just
[93:21] pure meditational directions or just
[93:23] poetry
[93:24] that don't take seriously the
[93:25] descriptions you plug these objects in
[93:28] and they make
[93:29] sense for instance in sepher they talk
[93:32] about a law of 37 and 12 and they're
[93:34] related it to Tali the dragon gal the
[93:39] wheel and Lobby the
[93:41] heart well the
[93:44] dragon is a line
[93:47] form and it has three aspects to
[93:52] it the wheel
[93:55] gal giml lamid giml lit cognate to our
[93:58] letters cl cl coil coil a double coil a
[94:03] wheel of Wheels it's a seven
[94:06] object and the
[94:09] heart heart down the
[94:12] middle there's also a heart on on this
[94:14] form too if you look through it see the
[94:16] heart shape front the back sits inside
[94:20] of a 12 symmetry
[94:22] object so the f fful description 37 and2
[94:25] a dragon a wheel and a heart just poetry
[94:29] to the ordinary translation if you plug
[94:31] in these models didn't make sense as a
[94:35] line a surface and a
[94:38] volume okay question again uh you start
[94:42] with the tetraedron and move to that
[94:45] gives rise to forms uh some at least one
[94:49] of which I guess the Ain is one of the
[94:51] fiveon St
[94:54] and uh what I understood of five
[94:57] plutonic sols you start with tetraedron
[94:58] and this is not plutonic Sol this is an
[95:00] archimedian Sol it's a
[95:02] semi-regular it's it's squares and
[95:04] triangular faces go ahead continue well
[95:07] there's a the five platonic solids if
[95:10] you draw the vortices out they each give
[95:11] rise to the next one and generates the
[95:13] next one the last one goes back to the
[95:16] seed form and I just wondering are these
[95:19] two things parallel are they different
[95:20] from each
[95:21] other the seed and the flower you mean
[95:25] well uh the theed you have here doesn't
[95:30] include the do No in fact the decahedron
[95:32] is is a kind of spin of of five spheres
[95:35] as five cubes words the decahedron can
[95:38] be thought of as a as five cubes that
[95:40] are sort of nested together and the
[95:43] first verse in fact that may be what's
[95:45] going to enable us to sort out those
[95:47] those points that aren't covered yet is
[95:49] that there AER packing I just could have
[95:52] drawn it that way would
[95:54] so that just represents it
[95:58] isn't the aedin is the closest packing
[96:02] of 12 spheres without a central sphere
[96:04] the cubat deedin has room for the
[96:06] central sphere that's why it surrounds
[96:09] the Lily on all sides it surrounded on
[96:11] the inside and
[96:13] outside that's where we started for what
[96:16] V the heavens and the Earth inside and
[96:20] outside
[96:23] about verse one folding up into that
[96:25] object some symmetry what about verse
[96:28] two I didn't I mentioned it earlier I
[96:30] didn't I have it in my notes here it's
[96:32] just much too long first two wants more
[96:34] letters and it makes a very big
[96:36] complicated pattern but it doesn't fold
[96:37] up into that same patter it folds up in
[96:40] well I can't be sure because it's too
[96:41] long to really twist it all down but it
[96:44] folds up into a pattern that maps on
[96:46] this pattern words they basically
[96:48] instead of there being just seven turns
[96:51] I believe there's 21 turns and fold
[96:54] symmetry I can show it to you after this
[96:57] is this is the third
[96:58] verse and again you can see how the
[97:00] letters pair
[97:02] up um I've looked at the first week and
[97:06] it gets complicated very quickly the
[97:08] elements of this pattern continue but I
[97:10] can't show the pattern explicitly beyond
[97:12] the first few days I've looked into the
[97:14] text and I found markers that indicate
[97:16] the patterns continue as far as about
[97:18] 2,000 letters in um and then there's
[97:21] other statistical work that confirms
[97:22] that there are other p patterns that
[97:24] permeate the text which I don't I
[97:25] haven't done any work on that but
[97:28] there's lots of indications the patterns
[97:30] do continue I've also correlated a hidic
[97:33] rabbi staying with us in December and he
[97:35] insisted that I check the last verse of
[97:36] Deuteronomy and I said what does that
[97:38] have to do with Genesis he said well
[97:39] there's a rabic teaching that the end of
[97:41] the Torah connects to the beginning of
[97:42] the Torah I said all right all right
[97:44] I'll check it correlates on the same
[97:47] form don't ask me how Deuteronomy was
[97:49] written according to the scholars a
[97:51] thousand years after Genesis
[97:55] please youres of light and mention that
[98:01] also be used instead of the tetraedron
[98:03] have you noticed any uh specific
[98:06] advantages like any specific instance
[98:09] where you'd want to use a cube rather
[98:10] than the
[98:11] Tet I'm using a tetrahedron because I
[98:14] believe that's the primary model and
[98:16] because the symmetries of the
[98:17] tetrahedron are the same as the
[98:19] symmetries of a cube or an octahedron
[98:22] and since it's the lowest order form
[98:23] it's the one most likely to be the
[98:25] universally chosen one because it's the
[98:26] unique lowest order form but in other
[98:30] cultures in various cultures at various
[98:32] times different ways of understanding
[98:34] this took priority um the Hebrews may
[98:38] have used the ram horn to model the
[98:40] shape of the vortex because it was a
[98:42] sacred object their tradition um
[98:45] Christians might have used a bell it's
[98:47] also a Vortex form uh maybe we have a
[98:49] horn of this maybe this you know I mean
[98:52] the they they Greeks seem to have used a
[98:54] double vortex in the form of an
[98:56] apple by the way this is the first form
[99:00] that functions as a donut remember the
[99:04] quality of this donut is that it falls
[99:06] through itself well if you try to make a
[99:07] tetrahedral a polyhedral frame pull
[99:10] through itself you can't do it until you
[99:12] get up to the cuboctahedron the
[99:16] cuboctahedron can pull through
[99:19] itself see this is a frame this is the
[99:22] Apple is the monad of wholeness a donut
[99:25] is flat it's a mathematically ideal
[99:27] because it's two Circ two circular
[99:29] cross-sections but it's not the lowest
[99:31] order form in the real world in the real
[99:34] world the one that has this embryonic
[99:36] quality of having a sphere surrounded by
[99:38] a sphere of spheres which can fractally
[99:40] unfold like an unfilling wavefront
[99:42] endlessly you need the cuac
[99:45] deed if one is conscious enough to be a
[99:49] witness to
[99:50] themselves and observe themselves the
[99:53] way these objects are self referential
[99:56] how does the fact that that watching
[99:58] affects what is being watched change
[100:02] the well they make them alive for you if
[100:04] you bring them into your Consciousness I
[100:06] mean I can't do that I can only propose
[100:09] that this was a way of of reaching a
[100:11] transcendental understanding for some
[100:13] people in the ancient world um it's very
[100:16] important to mention for instance I
[100:17] don't know how many of you are aware of
[100:18] the work of Ernest G mlan Pythagorean
[100:21] Plato the myth of invariance
[100:24] um meditations through the Kore and he's
[100:25] a a musicologist at Brooklyn College I
[100:28] guess he's elderly now and he's done
[100:31] very similar things to this entirely in
[100:32] musical metaphor the reason it works is
[100:35] because the Greek double octave maps on
[100:38] to the double cycle and so whatever
[100:41] you've done whatever I've shown you
[100:43] geometrically you could also produce
[100:45] musically but it's how you internalize
[100:47] it I you know can't make it real no one
[100:50] should believe me about Transcendence
[100:51] you got to try it I mean don't you can't
[100:54] believe anybody else about that um if
[100:56] you know it's ego death it is an ego
[101:02] death
[101:04] right it's a problem
[101:08] there question um do each of the letters
[101:12] have a sound a lot of the ways to
[101:14] transform is the
[101:16] sound we have a musical version of the
[101:18] text that we played out Simply by
[101:19] assigning notes to each letter and going
[101:21] up the scale in alphabetical order and
[101:23] the text is very evocative when you do
[101:24] that um but I don't think that's the the
[101:27] right sound we'd have to determine the
[101:28] sound of each letter what I would
[101:29] propose to do is to take these shadow
[101:33] grams and treat them like little graphs
[101:36] and run a fora transform on them to find
[101:39] their harmonic
[101:40] components and then see if that made
[101:43] sense as a kind of sound for each letter
[101:45] because see then when you heard the
[101:47] sound that would produce a point of
[101:49] conscious focus in your mind too mean
[101:52] sound connects the feeling very directly
[101:54] also these texts are all chanted people
[101:56] don't read you know um observant Jews
[101:59] don't read the Torah on a weekly they
[102:01] read the Torah through every year week
[102:03] by week they sing
[102:05] it the singing is primary not the not
[102:09] not the speaking of it is there con is
[102:12] there a set or something there is now
[102:15] but it's not clear if it's if it how far
[102:18] back it goes also there were hand
[102:19] gestures that used to go with it which
[102:21] were lost except the some of the Y Jews
[102:23] know the hand gestures but there's only
[102:25] a few thousand left so it's not obvious
[102:27] they've never been written
[102:31] down if you could build a an ideal model
[102:35] for this animated three dimensions at
[102:37] least what would it what basically would
[102:39] it look like become these shapes you
[102:42] well what is what does a hypersphere
[102:44] look like or a hyper Cube yeah I mean
[102:46] how would you put it in computer
[102:47] Graphics it doesn't look like anything
[102:49] it's a feeling so your feelings would
[102:53] best it was generated by your feelings
[102:55] let me give you an example let's say
[102:57] there were creatures living in flat land
[102:59] two-dimensional
[103:01] reality and we look down on them as far
[103:03] as they're concerned we'd be God we
[103:05] could see their whole world in the
[103:06] glance we could see inside of their
[103:08] bodies um if we wanted to talk to the
[103:11] Flatlanders what would we say to them
[103:13] and how could we say it well have to
[103:17] somehow hang out there for a while well
[103:18] we don't fit in flat land and they don't
[103:20] they don't know about three dimensions
[103:21] well conceptually I guess well what's
[103:23] the most important thing to say to a
[103:25] flatlander anybody want to guess hi well
[103:28] that's right Edward Edward Edward Abbott
[103:31] um actually proposes this question in
[103:32] his book flatland what well what is it
[103:34] anybody remember what's the question you
[103:36] ask a flatlander what's the most
[103:37] important thing to tell a flatlander
[103:39] what
[103:40] dire sort of hello look up is an
[103:43] infinitely greater Universe Transcendent
[103:45] to your own you know just like what God
[103:48] would like to tell us you know assuming
[103:49] there's a God I mean after all what's
[103:51] the most important thing how can you how
[103:52] how does God prove himself well think
[103:55] about it what could the flatlander what
[103:57] could what could we do to communicate
[103:58] with a flat to to transmit this message
[104:01] saying it wouldn't do any good who would
[104:03] believe it you know if God tapped you on
[104:05] the shoulder and say hey I'm God would
[104:06] you believe him nobody else seems to
[104:09] we've had that situation people don't
[104:10] believe it may maybe if you save their
[104:12] lives in some mysterious way well I'll
[104:14] tell you one way if you um if you
[104:17] projected onto flatland a hologram of a
[104:20] three-dimensional scene
[104:23] flatlander couldn't see it of course
[104:24] because he'd have to get out of flatland
[104:25] and shine his laser reference Beam on it
[104:27] in order to see it so that wouldn't work
[104:29] but what if the flatlander were to
[104:31] rhythmically Traverse the pattern on the
[104:34] surface of his flat land day by day and
[104:36] year by year for a lifetime building up
[104:38] on his cortex a model of the higher
[104:39] dimensional pattern and then in a Flash
[104:42] Maybe by a trauma he gets hit on the
[104:43] head maybe he's meditating maybe he
[104:45] takes some interesting chemicals um
[104:49] whatever um maybe he just goes into
[104:51] Alpha he would read out in a glance in a
[104:55] in a in a calini stroke he would he
[104:57] would get a glimpse of three space and
[104:58] then he'd
[104:59] believe well these texts are rythmically
[105:02] chanted day by day and year by year by
[105:06] Orthodox Jews for the last 2500 Years
[105:09] anyway so the feeling of transcendence
[105:11] and the feeling of creation pretty it's
[105:13] the feeling it snaps into place when you
[105:16] grock it when you sense it this is a
[105:18] living system yes what dimensionality do
[105:20] you figure it is I think we're looking
[105:22] at a fractal pattern that stretches from
[105:25] three dimensions where we are and
[105:27] reaches towards four dimensions and when
[105:29] it gets to four dimensions it starts
[105:31] over again in the point and then frows
[105:33] again I think we're looking at an an
[105:36] embedded recursive system where you go
[105:39] from Zero Dimensional seed point which
[105:42] has an intrinsic spin to it an intrinsic
[105:44] spin in this in the seed Point where's
[105:47] my here they are see this is a a sphere
[105:50] Point think of the tetrahedron defines a
[105:52] sphere
[105:53] that's what defines a ball and is a
[105:55] little this intrinsic spinning this it's
[105:56] like a pregnant point and it sort of
[105:59] bootstraps itself cork screws its way
[106:02] into one dimension the seed Sprouts a
[106:05] one-dimensional line
[106:07] stem and the line stem at the top of of
[106:10] a little Sprout there is a pair of of
[106:12] leaves forming a surface surface and
[106:16] then within those leaves eventually a
[106:17] bud comes up a volume and then from the
[106:20] bud a flower blossoms the flower gets
[106:23] all crenelated all bent over on itself
[106:25] cuz it doesn't quite fit in three
[106:26] dimensions it overflows three
[106:28] dimensions you know what the most common
[106:30] four-dimensional object is we've all see
[106:32] it all the time a fruit is a
[106:35] four-dimensional object it is an
[106:37] extrusion of a living
[106:39] thing into our
[106:44] reality and then of course within the
[106:46] fruit is a Zer dimensional seed that
[106:48] starts to process over again
