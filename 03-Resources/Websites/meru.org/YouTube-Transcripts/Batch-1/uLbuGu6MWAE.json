  "full_text": "the IDE one of the basic ideas that I developed over the 20 years of research was the idea that one should take seriously the teaching that God is a verb and not a noun that when we're looking at the spiritual World we're looking at a higher dimensional space at the Transcendent it's always dynamic in our space it's not static static is dead so if you and so I decided to look for geometric metaphor because I think that's a universal language and we could go into why the Aro project and the J je propulsion lab and and the ideas of trying to communicate with extraterrestrials look to mathematical forms and the chief mathematical form everybody wants to look for by the way is the number Pi because that that is the most interesting important number in all of Science and Math well I didn't get to what goes around comes around immediately so I'm going to start with As Above So Below by the way there's a website where you can you can find some of what I'm going to show you in some of the drawings that are going to be there can you put the main drawing yeah put the main drawing up if you think literally and you think in terms of nouns as above is the thing so below is the thing we'll stack them up geometrically it's like two parallel horizontal lines one is above and one is below if you're thinking dynamically then it's more what goes above is like what goes under and so I I came up with this idea of instead of making two unit lines just parallel of trying to see what would happen if you made a dynamic form and we're going to find out eventually that this line really is a circle and the circle's really a sphere as you go through the dimensions but let's just look at the line this is one unit and this is this is one unit also so what we're going to get when we make a triangle is not going to be an equilateral triangle it's going to be an isoceles triangle these two sides are are not units what this side is the unit and when you do that and extend these lines and just put a right angle it turns out that this is a three four five proportion triangle because this angle is exactly the same as the angle for the 345 triangle and if you start here and swing a radius then this length is related to the Golden Rule to the golden mean I'm sorry which is a numerical value which turns out to be a dead end for most of us but it but it comes from the Golden Rule the source of the golden mean is the Golden Rule the source of the 345 triangle the 345 triangle itself is interesting people have suggested that the Egyptians knew about it because they had this chord that had 12 divisions so 3+ 4 plus five adds up to 12 so if you had a knotted cord with a knot at every every unit you could you could easily make it into I don't know I can do and you have you could and later we're going to find out our circle is going to have a 12-fold symmetry so this 12 is going to end up showing up back back in the circle anyway so that's the basic idea but but we know something from physics um I didn't come upon it this way but we'll start with Newton Newton tells the laws of motion and the laws of gravity Newton tells us that pul equals momentum what Newton says is that this is time if you take a Clapper and hit a Gong really hard or have a thunderbolt with a lightning bolt a thunder clap you make an Impulse now in the ideal case it's going to be have take no time at all and it's going to be infinitely tall obviously that's not a real situation so any real impulse is going to be finite and have some duration in time but it turns out that this impulse is transferred when you when you hit a ball into momentum and the momentum I'm not I'm not making a scale for this the momentum continues on forever so I think it's Force time time equals mass time velocity so what was a short sharp pulse an Impulse becomes a low continued motion that just keeps going um that's the essence of impulse and momentum aong comes durak many years later and durak tells us well actually let's let's let's go to a musician first a musician makes makes some sort of music and it goes into a wave analyzer and he comes out with with a spectrum of the notes that are being played and this this is a a a spectrum analyzer formally what's really going on the way you do this the way you get sinewave components by analyzing a musical note or the way you get a a uh an optical Spectrum from a beam of white light it's called a 48 transform the idea is the physic mathematical physicist D said that a particle was like an infinite pulse that had absolute location but no duration no no movement at all and its wave function if if this pulse is infinite extends over all time from from minus in Infinity time I don't know how to make infinity time to plus infinity time at a negligible amplitude so there's an Infinity here with very little amplitude and there's an Infinity of amplitude here with very little breath and one is in the time domain and one is in the spatial domain but we can divide through by infinity and if we divide through by Infinity what we're going to get is the same triangle is the same form this is going to be unit up upside down here and a unit unit and a unit wide one is the particle and the other's the wave and they're complements so you only get one or the other or some in between value so we're finding that this this particular triangle is the basis of Newton's impulse moment momentum and it's the basis of particle wave Duality but it turns out of course that this is only this a flat surface and these are onedimensional lines the wave function is not onedimensional it can be in Hilbert space it can have lots of Dimensions if we're two-dimensional most people don't understand and let see if I can explain it this is actually a circle If This Were the origin and this were plus one and this was minus one it should be a half but it doesn't really matter then the radius would be here to here and the circumference could only be these these two points and that would that's called a a one a one-dimensional circle a one Circle but we could take it up a dimension and instead of a one Circle we could have a two Circle which is a circle now what do we have one this is the have the wave function the simplest version of it would be understood as a cycle of fifths a musical cycle which comes around constantly and what we have now is the wheel of karma we have what what what goes around comes around and we have As Above So Below we have two different axes one is circular and one is linear look at Lord and God God is all inclusive Lord is singular the Lord sits on the top of infinite pedestal lording it over the Earth plane which is the domain of all there is the Earth plane in general the plane of three-dimensional reality for",
