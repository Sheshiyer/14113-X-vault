[00:26] what I'm trying to tell people is don't get scared I'm not saying everybody's
[00:31] wrong this is like a rising tide it
[00:35] raises All Ships it only swamps those with holes in their holes it's a
[00:39] throwaway line I use it a lot it's not
[00:41] so I didn't just make it up the idea is
[00:44] that the tradition is are all over the
[00:46] place but they they include most of what
[00:49] they include has a basis but it's become distorted and mixed in with
[00:53] nonsense and there're also ancillary
[00:55] teachings which may or may not be true
[00:57] but even if they are true to stop at
[01:00] that level is damning by faint Praise
[01:03] You know the rabbis teach if I'm getting this right that the reason that AR
[01:06] astrology is Bann is not because it's false but because it works the problem is people start
[01:13] relying on astrology and forget about
[01:15] yat Hashem fear of God and say forget
[01:18] they they don't they don't real now I'm
[01:19] going to tell you why that's that's a
[01:21] mistake this is the beauty part and I want to mention Arthur Young first Arthur says the the physicist that
[01:30] created the helicopter rotor system and
[01:32] founded the institute for the study of
[01:34] Consciousness and who supported us for a while he passed
[01:38] away Arthur taught two things that were
[01:40] very important one the first sign of volition is saying no the child
[01:46] acquiesces you don't know if the kid is
[01:47] just going if the crowd's there or not
[01:49] but if someone says no I don't want any more
[01:52] food then there that's the first sign of
[01:54] conscious that's the first choice is negation that's why you have this negative space the other thing Arthur did is he
[02:02] identified the Quantum of action the photon or other quantum mechanical
[02:07] particle with the Quantum of conscious valtion a unit of
[02:12] choice so we're going to find out that
[02:17] photons each carry one Quant one unit of
[02:20] quantum of action one unit of potential
[02:22] quantum mechanical Choice when you make a choice then the wave equation
[02:27] collapses using old light language it's being replaced
[02:31] now the Hebrew equivalent is something called
[02:36] T the letter t means if you look in a
[02:40] dictionary the name t means serpent it
[02:42] means a constrictor it means bound and
[02:44] lamid is to learn or to teach low made it's bound learning it's a unit of
[02:57] information so the idea de is the F the there's a constant stream of
[03:03] photons that descend that rain on the
[03:06] plant life that use the chlorophyll and
[03:08] other means because it's not the only
[03:10] path they're parallel paths to get their
[03:13] order and what's left over they radiate
[03:15] back and give away back to the oil there
[03:18] is and we we get our neg entropy because we we consume the plant life in the same
[03:26] sense as the plants operate from the
[03:29] phys physical sun to the physical Sky which is by the way the Zodiac Hebrew
[03:41] word zodic Saint you know the one with the Halo on his
[03:47] head zodiac zodic the letter sadii Saint
[03:52] Halo Heavens cycle of this is the wheel of karma the Big K
[04:01] can't get off the wheel of karma if
[04:03] you're a vegetable you can't get off the
[04:06] wheel of karma if you've been caught up
[04:08] well here's here's the Hebrew word for neg for for negativity
[04:14] Satan the expression of being bound
[04:17] forever all it means is to have lost
[04:19] your free will it's all that word means
[04:22] is to have have your free will taken from you the worst punishment to a
[04:26] creature that's previously had Free Will
[04:27] is to take it away the GI given and eaten is
[04:33] withdrawn well to be locked onto the wheel of karma is to repeat is to not know
[04:41] history to repeat the same mistakes over
[04:43] and over again to pass on the injuries
[04:46] of your own childhood to your children in
[04:50] turn and not be able to break the wheel of karma what breaks the wheel of karma the introduction of
[04:58] novelty the ability ility to make a choice units of T units of
[05:05] information this 3 four five triangle on
[05:09] the top is an axe head it's the head of
[05:12] a hammer that shatters the wheel of karma it's The Sword and the
[05:19] stone the sword is the axis and this is
[05:22] this is the blade that that's a little
[05:26] hokey I'm not not standing on that as
[05:28] demonstr most of what I'm telling you
[05:30] with stuff I'm I'm saying is precisely
[05:32] so but when I'm saying something that I
[05:35] don't I'm not sure of that speculation
[05:37] I'm going to try to tell you because I need to say it because it helps
[05:41] to enable people to understand but it
[05:45] might be slippery there are coincidences here they're
[05:48] inevitable um people do things we're humans we we we make different
[05:53] choices the idea is that the wheel of
[05:56] karma is where the idolators and the pagans are locked on to they don't recognize the Transcendent
[06:05] son that supplies us with photons that
[06:08] we can make choices this is the matah
[06:11] the mitam the flat space of Egypt where
[06:15] Pharaoh thought he was God didn't know
[06:17] God so there was no way for pharaoh to break the wheel of karma thus his chariots were were swamped
