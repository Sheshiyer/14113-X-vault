[00:00:26] the IDE one of the basic ideas that I
[00:00:28] developed over the 20 years of research
[00:00:31] was the idea that one should take
[00:00:32] seriously the teaching that God is a
[00:00:35] verb and not a
[00:00:39] noun that when we're looking at the
[00:00:41] spiritual World we're looking at a
[00:00:43] higher dimensional space at the
[00:00:44] Transcendent it's always dynamic in our
[00:00:47] space it's not static static is
[00:00:52] dead so if you and so I decided to look
[00:00:55] for geometric metaphor because I think
[00:00:57] that's a universal language and we could
[00:00:58] go into why the
[00:01:00] Aro project and the J je propulsion lab
[00:01:03] and and the ideas of trying to
[00:01:05] communicate with extraterrestrials look
[00:01:07] to mathematical forms and the chief
[00:01:09] mathematical form everybody wants to
[00:01:11] look for by the way is the number Pi
[00:01:12] because that that is the most
[00:01:14] interesting important number in all of
[00:01:17] Science and
[00:01:18] Math well I didn't get to what goes
[00:01:21] around comes around immediately so I'm
[00:01:23] going to start with As Above So Below by
[00:01:25] the way there's a website where you can
[00:01:27] you can find some of what I'm going to
[00:01:29] show you in some of the drawings that
[00:01:30] are going to be there can you put the
[00:01:31] main drawing yeah put the main drawing
[00:01:34] up if you think literally and you think
[00:01:37] in terms of nouns as above is the thing
[00:01:39] so below is the thing we'll stack them
[00:01:40] up geometrically it's like two parallel
[00:01:42] horizontal lines one is above and one is
[00:01:44] below if you're thinking dynamically
[00:01:47] then it's more what goes above is like
[00:01:51] what goes
[00:01:52] under and so I I came up with this idea
[00:01:55] of instead of making two unit lines just
[00:01:58] parallel of trying to see what would
[00:02:00] happen if you made a dynamic
[00:02:01] form and we're going to find out
[00:02:04] eventually that this line really is a
[00:02:06] circle and the circle's really a sphere
[00:02:08] as you go through the dimensions but
[00:02:09] let's just look at the
[00:02:11] line this is one unit and this is this
[00:02:14] is one unit also so what we're going to
[00:02:17] get when we make a
[00:02:20] triangle is not going to be an
[00:02:21] equilateral
[00:02:23] triangle it's going to be an isoceles
[00:02:26] triangle these two sides are are not
[00:02:28] units what this side is the
[00:02:32] unit and when you do that and extend
[00:02:35] these
[00:02:37] lines and just put a right angle it
[00:02:41] turns out that this is a three four five
[00:02:46] proportion triangle because this angle
[00:02:49] is exactly the same as the angle for the
[00:02:51] 345
[00:02:52] triangle and if you start here and swing
[00:02:55] a
[00:02:57] radius then this length is related
[00:03:00] to the Golden Rule to the golden mean
[00:03:02] I'm sorry which is a numerical value
[00:03:05] which turns out to be a dead end for
[00:03:07] most of us but it but it comes from the
[00:03:09] Golden Rule the source of the golden
[00:03:11] mean is the Golden Rule the source of
[00:03:13] the 345 triangle the 345 triangle itself
[00:03:16] is interesting people have suggested
[00:03:17] that the Egyptians knew about it because
[00:03:19] they had this chord that had 12
[00:03:21] divisions so 3+ 4 plus five adds up to
[00:03:24] 12 so if you had a knotted cord with a
[00:03:26] knot at every every unit you could you
[00:03:29] could easily make it
[00:03:33] into I don't know I can
[00:03:36] do and you have you could and later
[00:03:39] we're going to find out our circle is
[00:03:40] going to have a 12-fold symmetry so this
[00:03:42] 12 is going to end up showing up back
[00:03:44] back in the circle anyway so that's the
[00:03:46] basic idea but but we know something
[00:03:49] from
[00:03:50] physics um I didn't come upon it this
[00:03:53] way but we'll start with Newton Newton
[00:03:55] tells the laws of motion and the laws of
[00:03:58] gravity Newton tells us that pul equals
[00:04:00] momentum what Newton says is that this
[00:04:03] is
[00:04:05] time if
[00:04:07] you take a Clapper and hit a Gong really
[00:04:11] hard or have a thunderbolt with a
[00:04:14] lightning bolt a thunder clap you make
[00:04:16] an Impulse now in the ideal case it's
[00:04:19] going to be have take no time at all and
[00:04:23] it's going to be infinitely tall
[00:04:25] obviously that's not a real situation so
[00:04:26] any real impulse is going to be finite
[00:04:28] and have some duration in time but it
[00:04:32] turns out that this
[00:04:34] impulse is transferred when you when you
[00:04:37] hit a ball into momentum and the
[00:04:39] momentum I'm not I'm not making a scale
[00:04:41] for this the momentum continues on
[00:04:44] forever so I think it's Force time time
[00:04:47] equals mass time
[00:04:49] velocity so what was a short sharp pulse
[00:04:52] an Impulse becomes a low continued
[00:04:57] motion that just keeps going
[00:05:03] um that's the essence of impulse and
[00:05:07] momentum aong comes durak many years
[00:05:12] later and durak tells
[00:05:15] us well actually let's let's let's go to
[00:05:18] a musician first a musician makes makes
[00:05:21] some sort of music and it goes into a
[00:05:23] wave analyzer and he comes out with with
[00:05:25] a spectrum of the notes that are being
[00:05:27] played
[00:05:30] and this this is a a a spectrum
[00:05:33] analyzer formally what's really going
[00:05:37] on the way you do this the way you get
[00:05:39] sinewave components by analyzing a
[00:05:42] musical note or the way you get a a uh
[00:05:45] an optical Spectrum from a beam of white
[00:05:47] light it's called a 48
[00:05:49] transform the idea
[00:05:54] is the physic mathematical physicist D
[00:05:57] said that a particle
[00:06:00] was like an infinite pulse that had
[00:06:03] absolute location but no duration no no
[00:06:06] movement at
[00:06:08] all and its wave
[00:06:13] function if if this pulse is infinite
[00:06:17] extends over all time from from minus in
[00:06:20] Infinity time I don't know how to make
[00:06:22] infinity time to plus infinity time at a
[00:06:25] negligible
[00:06:27] amplitude so there's an Infinity here
[00:06:30] with very little
[00:06:32] amplitude and there's an Infinity of
[00:06:34] amplitude here with very little breath
[00:06:36] and one is in the time domain and one is
[00:06:38] in the spatial domain but we can divide
[00:06:41] through by
[00:06:42] infinity and if we divide through by
[00:06:49] Infinity what we're going to get is the
[00:06:52] same triangle is the same form this is
[00:06:55] going to be unit
[00:06:57] up upside down here
[00:07:01] and a unit unit and a unit
[00:07:06] wide one is the particle and the other's
[00:07:08] the
[00:07:10] wave and they're
[00:07:12] complements so you only get one or the
[00:07:15] other or some in between
[00:07:19] value so we're finding that this this
[00:07:22] particular
[00:07:26] triangle is the basis of Newton's
[00:07:28] impulse moment momentum and it's the
[00:07:30] basis of particle wave Duality but it
[00:07:33] turns out of course that this is only
[00:07:36] this a flat surface and these are
[00:07:37] onedimensional lines the wave function
[00:07:39] is not onedimensional it can be in
[00:07:41] Hilbert space it can have lots of
[00:07:42] Dimensions if we're
[00:07:44] two-dimensional most people don't
[00:07:46] understand and let see if I can explain
[00:07:49] it this is actually a circle If This
[00:07:52] Were the origin and this were plus one
[00:07:54] and this was minus one it should be a
[00:07:56] half but it doesn't really matter then
[00:07:58] the radius
[00:08:02] would
[00:08:04] be here to here and the circumference
[00:08:07] could only be these these two points and
[00:08:09] that would that's called a a one a
[00:08:11] one-dimensional circle a one
[00:08:14] Circle but we could take it up a
[00:08:19] dimension and instead of a one Circle we
[00:08:22] could have a two Circle which is a
[00:08:26] circle now what do we have one this is
[00:08:30] the have the wave function the simplest
[00:08:32] version of it would be understood as a
[00:08:33] cycle of fifths a musical cycle which
[00:08:35] comes around constantly and what we have
[00:08:38] now is the wheel of
[00:08:41] karma we have what what what goes around
[00:08:44] comes around and we have As Above So
[00:08:47] Below we have two different axes one is
[00:08:51] circular and one is
[00:08:55] linear look at Lord and God
[00:09:01] God is all
[00:09:03] inclusive Lord is
[00:09:06] singular the Lord sits on the top of
[00:09:10] infinite
[00:09:11] pedestal lording it over the Earth
[00:09:14] plane which is the domain of all there
[00:09:17] is the Earth plane in general the plane
[00:09:19] of three-dimensional
[00:09:28] reality for
