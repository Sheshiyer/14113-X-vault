scared I'm not saying everybody's wrong this is like a rising tide it raises All Ships it only swamps those with holes in their holes it's a throwaway line I use it a lot it's not so I didn't just make it up the idea is that the tradition is are all over the place but they they include most of what they include has a basis but it's become distorted and mixed in with nonsense and there're also ancillary teachings which may or may not be true but even if they are true to stop at that level is damning by faint Praise You know the rabbis teach if I'm getting this right that the reason that AR astrology is Bann is not because it's false but because it works the problem is people start relying on astrology and forget about yat Hashem fear of God and say forget they they don't they don't real now I'm going to tell you why that's that's a mistake this is the beauty part and I want to mention Arthur Young first Arthur says the the physicist that created the helicopter rotor system and founded the institute for the study of Consciousness and who supported us for a while he passed away Arthur taught two things that were very important one the first sign of volition is saying no the child acquiesces you don't know if the kid is just going if the crowd's there or not but if someone says no I don't want any more food then there that's the first sign of conscious that's the first choice is negation that's why you have this negative space the other thing Arthur did is he identified the Quantum of action the photon or other quantum mechanical particle with the Quantum of conscious valtion a unit of choice so we're going to find out that photons each carry one Quant one unit of quantum of action one unit of potential quantum mechanical Choice when you make a choice then the wave equation collapses using old light language it's being replaced now the Hebrew equivalent is something called T the letter t means if you look in a dictionary the name t means serpent it means a constrictor it means bound and lamid is to learn or to teach low made it's bound learning it's a unit of information so the idea de is the F the there's a constant stream of photons that descend that rain on the plant life that use the chlorophyll and other means because it's not the only path they're parallel paths to get their order and what's left over they radiate back and give away back to the oil there is and we we get our neg entropy because we we consume the plant life in the same sense as the plants operate from the phys physical sun to the physical Sky which is by the way the Zodiac Hebrew word zodic Saint you know the one with the Halo on his head zodiac zodic the letter sadii Saint Halo Heavens cycle of this is the wheel of karma the Big K can't get off the wheel of karma if you're a vegetable you can't get off the wheel of karma if you've been caught up well here's here's the Hebrew word for neg for for negativity Satan the expression of being bound forever all it means is to have lost your free will it's all that word means is to have have your free will taken from you the worst punishment to a creature that's previously had Free Will is to take it away the GI given and eaten is withdrawn well to be locked onto the wheel of karma is to repeat is to not know history to repeat the same mistakes over and over again to pass on the injuries of your own childhood to your children in turn and not be able to break the wheel of karma what breaks the wheel of karma the introduction of novelty the ability ility to make a choice units of T units of information this 3 four five triangle on the top is an axe head it's the head of a hammer that shatters the wheel of karma it's The Sword and the stone the sword is the axis and this is this is the blade that that's a little hokey I'm not not standing on that as demonstr most of what I'm telling you with stuff I'm I'm saying is precisely so but when I'm saying something that I don't I'm not sure of that speculation I'm going to try to tell you because I need to say it because it helps to enable people to understand but it might be slippery there are coincidences here they're inevitable um people do things we're humans we we we make different choices the idea is that the wheel of karma is where the idolators and the pagans are locked on to they don't recognize the Transcendent son that supplies us with photons that we can make choices this is the matah the mitam the flat space of Egypt where Pharaoh thought he was God didn't know God so there was no way for pharaoh to break the
