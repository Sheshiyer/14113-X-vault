# The Immortality of the Past

## Summary

A deep philosophical exploration of the nature of the past and its continued participation in the present, drawing on Whitehead's process metaphysics, David Bohm's holographic universe theory, Ervin Laszlo's akashic field concept, and Jean Gebser's consciousness structures. The video argues that the past is never annihilated but is immortalized within a supra-consciousness of the cosmos, continually participating in the creative advance of reality through formative resonance. This metaphysical framework is then used to reinterpret Neolithic ancestor veneration practices, Julian Jaynes' bicameral mind theory, Aboriginal Australian dreamtime cosmology, and the relationship between the living and the dead.

## Key Insights

- Whitehead's process metaphysics understands the past as the purpose of cosmogenesis -- the final yet ever-unfinished product of cosmic creativity that serves as an ever-expanding reservoir continually drawn upon.
- David Bohm's implicate order parallels Whitehead's mental pole: a domain not divided by spatial proximity or temporal sequence, where all things are infolded upon one another in a singularity, holographically projected into the explicate order.
- Ervin Laszlo identifies the zero-point quantum field with the Indic concept of akasha, an ever-present domain of potentiality and consciousness containing the entirety of the past as an "akashic record."
- The four modes of creative dynamism in concrescence are noesis (experience of form/potentiality), concretion (collapse of possibilities into actualities), sensation (physical inheritance of past determinations), and resonance (formative similarity connecting past and present through morphological space).
- Neolithic plastered skulls and ancestor veneration practices may represent genuine technologies for maintaining communication with the dead through formative resonance, rather than mere superstition.
- Whitehead's theological vision: the past is not only preserved but redeemed -- dissonances of the past find their place within a greater harmonic cohesion, transmuted from mere suffering into forms of tragic beauty.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Process Metaphysics**: Whitehead's actual entities, concrescence, mental and physical poles, the consequent nature of God
- **Holographic Cosmology**: Bohm's implicate/explicate order, holographic projection, the akashic field
- **Ancestor Consciousness**: Neolithic plastered skulls, Julian Jaynes' bicameral mind, Aboriginal dreamtime
- **Formative Resonance**: Morphological space, sympathetic resonance, the magical structure of consciousness
- **Redemptive Cosmology**: The Kingdom of Heaven as cosmic harmonic synthesis, suffering transmuted into tragic beauty

> we are closer to the abyss than we wish to admit but is fortunate that we have an insight into the fact that we are the abyss each of us must have this Insight in order to Prevail over over the abyss at the very least in the hour of our death and if such Insight is not gained until then this hour will be one of bitterness and Terror Jean gser the everpresent origin the stoic philosopher Epictetus once stated...
