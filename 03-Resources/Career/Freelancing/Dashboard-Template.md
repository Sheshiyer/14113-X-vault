Who am I?
I'm Anna, web designer and content creator. Over the past 2 years I have gone from struggling freelancer charging $500 for a website to booking projects starting at $5000+
These are the exact systems and templates I use to streamline my workflow and run a booked out web design business in less than 20 hours per week.
FAQs
Who is this for?
This dashboard is perfect for any service-based business. While the example project templates included are the ones I use in my web design business, in the tutorial video I show you how you can easily adapt them to your own business.
How does this work?
After purchase, you'll receive a link to duplicate the Freelance Dashboard template into your Notion app. If you're new to Notion, I've included a video to help you get started.
Why Notion?
Available on every platform
Highly customisable, allowing you to take full advantage of the powerful database features or simplify your workflow down to what works for you and your business.
Simple to use and maintain
Do I need to pay for Notion to use this?
You can set this up in the free Notion account! However, you may want to upgrade to the plus plan ($8/month) in the future if you are sharing pages with more than 10 clients at a time.
Still, have questions?
