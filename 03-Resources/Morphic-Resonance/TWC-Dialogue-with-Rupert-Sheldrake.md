# Dialogue with Rupert Sheldrake

## Summary

A direct conversation between The Whole Critter (Keelen) and Rupert Sheldrake exploring the philosophical foundations and mechanisms of morphic resonance. The dialogue covers the problem of induction in science, the nature of physical constants as habits rather than fixed laws, the role of consciousness in creative evolution, the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics as a possible framework for understanding morphic resonance and vision, and the relationship between potentia, gravity, and consciousness. Sheldrake praises Keelen's exposition of morphic resonance and they explore deep connections between Whitehead's process philosophy, Bergson's creative evolution, and David Bohm's implicate order.

## Key Insights

- Sheldrake argues that regularities of nature are more like habits than fixed laws -- habits that build up through repetition and become so deep-seated over billions of years that they behave as if governed by eternal laws, but to test morphic resonance you must study new habits.
- The problem of induction (Hume) is reframed through Goethe's approach: Goethe discovered the premaxillary bone in humans through pure intuition about nature's formative compositional elements, not empirical data.
- Consciousness is not necessarily required for teleology -- habits through repetition become unconscious (riding a bicycle, speaking one's native language), and embryological development is habitual but not conscious.
- The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (John Cramer, Ruth Kastner) suggests that every photon absorption involves a reverse emission moving backwards in time, potentially explaining scopaesthesia (the sense of being stared at) and connecting to Whitehead's ideas about mental causation.
- Tom Van Flandern's calculation that gravity must operate at least 20 billion times the speed of light suggests gravity may be fundamentally mental rather than physical in nature.
- Ruth Kastner's work on "potentia" as real things -- possibilities that are part of reality and help shape reality -- converges remarkably with Whitehead's process philosophy.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Habits vs. Laws**: The reconceptualization of natural laws as cosmic habits built through repetition
- **Potentia as Real**: Treating possibilities as genuine ontological entities (Whitehead, Kastner, Bohm)
- **Reverse Causation**: The transactional interpretation and its implications for consciousness, vision, and time
- **Action at a Distance**: From Newton's "sensorium of God" through Einstein's fields to quantum nonlocality
- **Multi-dimensional Space**: Bernard Carr's use of extra dimensions in physics as a medium for morphic resonance and consciousness

## Transcript Excerpt

> all right rert sheldrake super excited to uh have you here chatting today and um yeah thank you so much for joining me um there's a few things that I I thought it' be cool for us to discuss so I'm going to go ahead and get the ball rolling on that I know we do have a little bit of uh time restraint but well let me first say Ken that how much I appreciate the um work you've done so far I your um long Exposition on morphic resonance...
