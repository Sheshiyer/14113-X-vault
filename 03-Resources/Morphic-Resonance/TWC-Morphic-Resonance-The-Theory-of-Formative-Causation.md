# Morphic Resonance; The Theory of Formative Causation

## Summary

A comprehensive and polished single-video treatment of Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance, returning to the topic with refined thinking and expanded context. The video traces Sheldrake's intellectual biography from his early biochemistry research on plant hormones (auxin polar transport) through to his development of the theory of formative causation. It situates morphic resonance within the metaphysical frameworks of Bergson and Whitehead, connects it to Michael Levin's bioelectric field research, examines empirical evidence, and explores broader implications for cosmology, consciousness, and parapsychological phenomena. The presentation argues that morphic resonance is not a fringe curiosity but an idea of immense philosophical and metaphysical significance that offers an entry point beyond mechanistic materialism.

## Key Insights

- Sheldrake's early research on auxin hormone distribution in plant tissues revealed that while biochemistry could describe the mechanics of plant growth, it could not explain why plants develop particular forms -- the question of morphogenesis remained fundamentally unanswered.
- Morphic resonance proposes that organisms inherit form and behavior through a non-local, non-energetic process of formative similarity, where past organisms of the same type contribute to the morphogenetic field that shapes subsequent organisms.
- The theory connects deeply to Bergson's creative evolution (habits of nature, memory as ontological) and Whitehead's process metaphysics (eternal objects, conceptual prehensions, formative causation).
- Michael Levin's research on bioelectric fields in developmental biology provides modern empirical support for the existence of morphogenetic fields that guide tissue differentiation beyond genetic instructions alone.
- Sheldrake began as a thoroughgoing materialist atheist before his research led him to conclude that mechanistic materialism was fundamentally inadequate to explain the phenomena he was studying.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Formative Causation**: Morphogenetic fields as non-local attractors shaping biological development
- **Beyond Mechanism**: The inadequacy of mechanistic materialism to explain morphogenesis, consciousness, and memory
- **Philosophical Foundations**: Bergson's duration and habit, Whitehead's eternal objects, Sheldrake's synthesis
- **Bioelectric Fields**: Michael Levin's experimental evidence for morphogenetic information beyond DNA
- **Parapsychological Implications**: Collective memory, telepathy, and the extended mind as natural consequences of morphic resonance

## Transcript Excerpt

> those of you who have been following my channel for a while are probably aware that one of the first topics which I attempted to delve into in detail was the theory of morphic resonance as developed by the British biologist and philosopher of science rert sheldrake we've definitely covered a lot of ground since those early videos and I've also made some rather substantial progress in refining my own process of creating...
