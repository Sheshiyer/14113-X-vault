# Radical Otherness; Conversations with Alex Gomez Marin Part 2

## Summary

The second conversation between Killian and Alex Gomez-Marin explores the nature of radical otherness across multiple registers -- philosophical, religious, and phenomenological. They discuss the value of unscripted dialogue as a form of thinking-in-real-time, the tension between monotheistic universalism and animistic pluralism, McKenna's and Steiner's convergent visions of radical plurality beyond Oneness, the UAP phenomenon as an encounter with genuine otherness, and the limits of Enlightenment rationalism. The conversation also addresses Daniel Dennett's legacy, the "Four Horsemen" of New Atheism, and the courage required to leap beyond reason.

## Key Insights

1. **Thinking as live performance**: Genuine philosophical conversation is compared to a circus or live concert -- vulnerable, improvised, and capable of producing emergent insights ("the third element" in between). This contrasts with rehearsed academic presentations.

2. **Radical pluralism beyond Oneness**: Both Steiner and McKenna suggest that beyond the mystical state of pure Oneness lies another layer teeming with radical diversity and life. The comfort-seeking ego may have shaped even esoteric traditions toward homogeneous unity rather than confronting genuine otherness.

3. **Dennett's incomplete revolution**: Dennett correctly identified that epiphenomenalist and emergentist views of consciousness are rehashed dualism, and that there is no Cartesian theater. But he never provided an actual explanation of consciousness -- only of selfhood (multiple drafts model) -- and refused to bite the bullet on either eliminativism or panexperientialism.

4. **UAP as radical vulnerability**: The UAP phenomenon forces confrontation with something potentially more intelligent and powerful that does not conform to human categories. This radical vulnerability parallels being dropped in a forest without technology -- a metaphysical nakedness.

5. **The leap beyond reason**: The "Four Horsemen" of rational materialism charted immense intellectual territory but failed at the crucial moment requiring a leap of courage beyond reason. Figures like Bergson, Blavatsky, Sri Aurobindo, and Steiner made such leaps without lacking rational rigor.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny**: Individual intellectual development mirrors the historical arc from naive religiosity through materialism to something new; the current generation may still be completing this recapitulation.
- **Prolonged adolescence and neoteny**: Empirical evidence that humans are physiologically aging more slowly, potentially indicating a longer developmental recapitulation before entering genuinely new territory.
- **Monotheism vs. animism**: Physics training as a form of monotheistic universalism; the difficulty of truly imagining animistic comfort with radical plurality.
- **The subtext of communication**: Meta-reflection on how the medium and context of conversation shapes what can be thought and said.
