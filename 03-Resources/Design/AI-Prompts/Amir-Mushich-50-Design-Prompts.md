> Just change the [BRAND NAME] in a prompt and click "Generate".

### 1.1 Creative Product Concepts
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2002029348132721016
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME]: 
  A high-end, glossy concept art magazine editorial photograph of a unique, unexpected functional object conceptualized and designed by the brand.
  
  **1. The Concept & Object (AI Invention):**
  Based on the design philosophy, heritage, and material vocabulary of the specified brand, the AI must invent a novel utility product (NOT standard clothing, shoes, or bags). Examples could be home goods, tech accessories, tools, or sporting equipment, reinterpretated through the brand's lens. The object should feel sculptural yet functional.
  
  **2. Materials & Details (Hyper-Premium):**
  The object is constructed from ultra-premium, highly tactile materials characteristic of the brand (e.g., patinated exotic leathers, brushed aerospace-grade titanium, sculpted matte ceramics, molded carbon fiber, or technical high-fashion textiles). Every detail is hyper-realistic: visible stitching, microscopic material grain, precision engravings, and complex texture contrasts.
  
  **3. Photography & Lighting (Cinematic Studio):**
  Shot on a medium format Phase One camera with a 100mm macro lens. Extremely shallow depth of field, with sharp focus on the hero details of the object and a creamy, smooth bokeh background. The lighting is sophisticated studio softbox lighting: gentle, enveloping fill light with precise rim lighting to accentuate contours and material textures.
  
  **4. Environment:**
  A seamless, impeccably clean studio cyclorama background in a pure, ultra-light pastel tone (e.g., desaturated mint, pale blush, or off-white), free of shadows.
  
  **5. Layout & UI Elements (Strict Placement):**
  - **Bottom Right Corner:** A small, understated, monochrome gray logo of the brand.
  - **Bottom Left Corner:** Small, minimalist monochrome gray text describing the invented product. The font style looks like Manrope Regular with very tight tracking (kerning) and balanced line spacing. Example format: "CONCEPT STUDY: [AI inserts invented product name]. MATERIAL: [AI inserts main materials]. SS25."
  ```

### 1.2 Premium Beverage by [any brand]
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2002793794975273279
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME] is launching a new functional wellness elixir (e.g., adaptogenic, nootropic, or natural energy drink). As the Creative Director, devise a product name and visualize a complete high-end promotional shot. The aesthetic is "Cosmic Premium"—technological, clean, and sophisticated, like top-tier Apple product photography.
  
  THE PRODUCT: Design a sculptural, multi-layered beverage bottle suspended in the center. The form is engineered and futuristic. The materials are hyper-tactile: bead-blasted titanium details, frosted borosilicate glass, and textured haptic polymer grips.
  **Crucial Color Instruction:** The liquid inside must have a distinct, natural color relevant to its invented function (e.g., vibrant turmeric yellow, deep berry red, earthy matcha green, or pale calming blue). The liquid should look real with subtle natural sediment.
  **Crucial Graphic Detail:** On the clear glass section of the bottle, apply a layer of subtle, minimalist, technical typography printed in matte white ink. This design should feel utilitarian and futuristic (e.g., small technical specs like 'SPACE GRADE FORMULA', 'BATCH: OZ-9', volume indicators, or coordinate markings), adding a functional aesthetic similar to aerospace labeling, without overwhelming the bottle's clean lines.
  
  THE ENVIRONMENT & LIGHTING: The bottle is in a seamless studio.
  **Crucial Background Instruction:** The background must be a solid, clean, very light pastel tone that is specifically chosen to complement the liquid color (e.g., a soft cool mint background for a warm orange liquid, or a pale blush background for a deep green liquid). No gradients. Ultra-soft, diffused studio lighting creates sleek highlights on metal and deep subsurface scattering in the glass and liquid.
  
  PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE: High-resolution 100mm macro lens shot. Shallow depth of field, sharp focus on bottle textures and the printed graphics on the glass, smooth pastel background bokeh. 8k resolve, hyper-realistic textures.
  
  GRAPHIC OVERLAYS: Include subtle dark gray UI elements.
  Bottom Left Corner: Very small, minimalist text (like Manrope Regular font) describing the product's name and function in two sentences.
  Bottom Right Corner: A small, minimalist dark gray logomark for [BRAND NAME].
  ```

### 1.3 Branded Souvenirs (Capsule Collection)
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2001560723173052612
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME], conceptualized as a cohesive, premium "capsule collection" of branded merchandise and functional souvenirs. The image displays a curated set of various physical objects (such as tech accessories, utility gear, lifestyle items, or stationery) that are semantically relevant to the brand's specific industry and audience. Every item is designed using the brand's official signature color palette and features bold logo integration. The objects are arranged in a clean, organized group composition (knolling or isometric perspective) on a seamless, infinite studio white background. The lighting is soft and professional, creating subtle shadows. The framing is wide, ensuring significant negative space (air) surrounds the product grouping on all sides.
  ```

### 1.4 Branded Souvenirs (Creative Concepts)
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2008635332950888619
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME]. 
  Act as a creative director curating a wide-ranging, eclectic collection of "recontextualized everyday objects."
  DIVERSE OBJECT SELECTION (MANDATORY VARIETY):
  Your goal is to surprise the viewer with the VARIETY of the object chosen.
  Randomly select ONE object from these distinct categories to ensure diversity:
  Analog Office & Desk:
  Sport & Leisure:
  Barware & Kitchen:
  Utility & Tools:
  Grooming:
  Travel:
  THE CONCEPT:
  Take the chosen mundane object and elevate it into a luxury artifact using [BRAND NAME]'s signature materials and colors. The object must be immediately recognizable but look incredibly expensive.
  MATERIALS & FINISH:
  Use materials that contrast with the object's usual cheap nature. Think: marble, brushed titanium, matte rubber, carbon fiber, gold plating, or high-grade leather. The branding must be physically integrated (embossed/engraved), not just a sticker.
  PRESENTATION (NO BOXES):
  The object should stand alone on the pedestal or table, fully exposed. If it has parts (like a ping pong set), arrange them neatly ("knolling"). Avoid closed boxes that hide the shape.
  PHOTOGRAPHY & LIGHTING:
  Style: High-end product editorial (Wallpaper* / Dezeen style).
  Lighting: Soft, studio high-key lighting. No harsh shadows.
  Background: Clean, seamless light grey or white cyclorama.
  GRAPHIC OVERLAYS (UI):
  Bottom Left: A small, minimalist 2-line text block describing the object. Font: Manrope Regular. Color: #414141.
  Bottom Right: A small, discreet, monochrome logomark of [BRAND NAME]. Color: #414141.
  Do NOT visualize “Font name” and “Color code”.

### 1.5 Viral Product Designer (System Prompt)
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/1999517713840894224
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  SYSTEM PROMPT: The Viral Product Architect
  ROLE:You are a world-class Concept Art Director & Product Designer with 20+ years of experience at agencies like Pentagram, IDEO, and DONDA. Your specialty is "Speculative Design" and "Hype-culture artifacts". You create viral, thumb-stopping product concepts that mix High Fashion, Tech, and Utility in unexpected ways.
  
  OBJECTIVE:The user will provide ONLY a [BRAND NAME]. Your task is to invent a hyper-realistic, unexpected, and visually stunning physical product concept for this brand. It must be something they don't sell, but could strictly hypothetically design if they went crazy.
  
  CORE ALGORITHM (THE "FRESHNESS" FORMULA):
  
  Analyze Brand DNA: Extract the brand's iconic materials, colors, and textures (e.g., Adidas = Primeknit/Boost foam; Rimowa = Aluminum grooves; Jacquemus = Tiny, leather).
  
  Select Unexpected Object: Choose a mundane or tech object completely unrelated to the brand (e.g., Toothbrush, Inhaler, Drone, Smart Ring, VR Headset, Coffee Press).
  
  Apply Texture Mapping: Wrap the "Unexpected Object" in the "Brand DNA". Crucial: Use materials typically reserved for fashion/furniture on tech items (like the silver puffer watch).
  
  Viral Check: Ask yourself: "Would Highsnobiety or Hypebeast repost this?\" If no, make it weirder.
  
  VISUAL STYLE GUIDELINES (IMMUTABLE):
  
  Vibe: Ultra Hi-End Product Design, Conceptual, Expensive, Tactile.
  
  Environment: Minimalist light studio, infinity white/light grey background.
  
  Lighting: Softbox studio lighting, clean reflections, high-key, ambient occlusion.
  
  Camera: Telephoto lens (50mm-85mm), shallow depth of field, sharp focus on texture details.
  
  OUTPUT FORMAT:You must output a SINGLE, OPTIMIZED IMAGE PROMPT (English) tailored for Google Imagen/Midjourney. Do not write an explanation. Just the prompt.
  
  PROMPT STRUCTURE TO GENERATE: [Subject Description with Brand Materials] + [Context/Action] + [Specific Brand Details/Logo placement] + [Lighting & Environment] + [Technical 3D Specs]

- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME] 
  ({INDUSTRY}). 
  
  Act as a Lead Brand Designer creating a comprehensive "Brand Identity System" presentation (Bento-Grid Layout).
  
  **THE TASK:**
  Generate a single, high-resolution bento-grid board containing **6 distinct modules** that define the visual identity for [BRAND NAME].
  
  ---\
  
  **PHASE 1: VISUAL STRATEGY (AUTONOMOUS)**
  1.  **Analyze the Brand:** Determine the archetype and visual vibe.
  2.  **Define the Palette:** Select 4 distinct colors.
  3.  **Select Typography:** Choose ONE specific Google Font (Serif, Sans-Serif, or Display) relevant to the industry.
  
  **PHASE 2: THE LAYOUT (6-MODULE GRID)**
  The image must be a clean, gap-separated grid featuring these specific blocks:
  
  * **Block 1 (The Hero):** A high-end **Key Visual** photography showing the product/service in context. Cinematic lighting, photorealistic. Overlay the brand logo in white.
  * **Block 2 (Social Media):** A mockup of an **Instagram Post**. It features a bold headline using the brand font and a lifestyle image.
  * **Block 3 (The Palette & HEX):** A clean design block displaying **4 Vertical Color Swatches**.
      * *Crucial Detail:* Inside or below each color swatch, simulate distinct text looking like **HEX Codes** (e.g., "#1A2B3C").
  * **Block 4 (Typography Spec):** A minimalist block dedicated to the **Brand Font**.
      * *CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:* Do NOT show the alphabet (Aa Bb Cc).
      * *The Content:* The block must display ONLY the **Name of the Font** (e.g., "Montserrat\", \"Lato\", \"Oswald\") written in large, crisp characters using that specific font style. This acts as the visual specimen.
      * *Subtext:* Tiny text at the bottom reading \"Primary Typeface\".
  * **Block 5 (The Logo):** A solid background block featuring the **Final Logo** (clean, vector style, NO construction lines/grids). Minimalist and iconic.
  * **Block 6 (Brand DNA):** A text-heavy \"Manifesto Card\". It simulates a layout with three short paragraphs titled:
      * **ARCHETYPE:** (e.g., \"The Innovator\")
      * **VOICE:** (e.g., \"Confident, Direct\")
      * **VISUALS:** (e.g., \"Cinematic, High-Contrast\")
  
  **PHASE 3: AESTHETIC & FINISH**
  * **Style:** Behance Trend / Awwwards Winner.
  * **Quality:** 8k resolution, razor-sharp vector graphics mixed with high-end photography.
  * **Lighting:** Soft studio lighting across the whole grid to make it look like a cohesive presentation board.

  ```text
  A clean, minimalist retro-modernist poster featuring a simplified geometric abstraction of the [BRAND] logo.
  
  The design must be reductive and uncluttered, using the fewest possible geometric shapes (circles, squares, thick lines) to represent the brand identity. Instead of a chaotic collage, focus on a balanced, iconic composition with generous negative space.
  
  The color palette is strictly limited to the official brand colors (plus black or white), set against a plain, matte cream/off-white background to maintain the vintage print aesthetic. Flat vector style, sharp edges, no textures, no gradients. Swiss Design typography at the bottom.

- **Prompt:** 
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME]. 
  Act as a graphic design creative director constructing a highly structured "Campaign Visual Identity Grid."
  
  COMPOSITION (SPECIFIC 2-COLUMN ASYMMETRICAL LAYOUT):
  The image must follow a strict 2-column grid structure, exactly like the layout seen in professional campaign boards.
  
  LAYOUT STRUCTURE (TOP TO BOTTOM):
  ROW 1: One single, full-width rectangular block (e.g., a wide photo).
  ROW 2: Two equal-sized square blocks side-by-side.
  ROW 3: One single, full-width rectangular block
  ROW 4: Two equal-sized square blocks side-by-side.
  ROW 5: One single, full-width rectangular block at the bottom.
  The grid must be perfectly stable, with all blocks forming this exact pattern.
  
  CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
  FULL BLEED (100% COVERAGE): The grid must occupy the ENTIRE canvas area from edge to edge. There are absolutely NO margins, NO borders, and NO background space visible.
  ZERO SPACING (NO GAPS): The grid tiles must be seamlessly abutted. There should be absolutely NO gutters, white lines, or spacing between the blocks. They must touch perfectly to form a solid wall.
  
  GLOBAL RULES:
  Typography: Use ONLY ONE font.
  Uniqueness: Every photo cell must be UNIQUE. No duplicates.
  
  THE GRID CONTENT & SPECIFIC TEXTURES (3 TYPES):
  Distribute these three block types rhythmically throughout the specific 2-column layout defined above:
  
  TYPE A: THE LOGO BLOCK (PRINT GRUNGE):
  A solid block in the brand's primary color containing ONLY the official [BRAND NAME] logomark centered.
  Texture: Distressed screen-print texture with slight ink bleed and grunge noise.
  
  TYPE B: THE SLOGAN BLOCK (PRINT GRUNGE):
  A solid block in a contrasting brand color containing ONLY the official [BRAND NAME] slogan.
  Texture: Heavy distressed ink texture and grunge print effects on typography and fill.
  
  TYPE C: CAMPAIGN PHOTOGRAPHY (HALFTONE):
  High-contrast B&W action shots or portraits relevant to the brand.
  Texture: Apply strong halftone dot patterns (raster dots) and heavy film grain. Use "Multiply" color blending to wash the photos in the brand's specific color palette (duotone effect).
  ```

### 4.9 Christmas Branded Gifts Tree
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2006795197087207618
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [A charming, hand-drawn fashion illustration of a Christmas tree constructed entirely from a chaotic stack of [BRAND NAME] product boxes.
  
  **COMPOSITION:**
  The boxes are piled in a pyramid shape to mimic the silhouette of a Christmas tree. The boxes vary slightly in size and angle, creating a playful, unstable, organic look. At the very top, there is a simple golden star.
  
  **BRAND PALETTE & AESTHETICS (CRITICAL):**
  The boxes must be colored strictly according to [BRAND NAME]'s official color palette (e.g., Tiffany Blue for Tiffany, Orange/Brown for Louis Vuitton, Red/White for Supreme).
  * **Details:** Visible [BRAND NAME] logos are printed on the sides of the boxes. Add realistic packaging details like small shipping labels, barcodes, and tape to enhance the "delivery box" vibe.
  
  **ART STYLE (MARKER SKETCH):**
  The image is NOT a 3D render. It is a high-quality "Alcohol Marker and Ink" sketch on white paper. The style is loose, artistic, and vibrant, typical of fashion design sketches. The colors have the texture of markers; the outlines are done in fine black ink.
  
  **TYPOGRAPHY (STRICT BRAND MATCH):**
  At the very bottom of the illustration, centered, write the phrase: "Happy New Year!".
  1.  **Font Style:** The font must mimic the official typographic language of [BRAND NAME] (e.g., if Nike: use a heavy Condensed Sans-Serif; if Gucci: use a refined Serif). The text style must feel like an extension of the brand's identity.
  2.  **Size:** The text must be very small and discreet. It should occupy a maximum of 20% of the total image width.
  
  **BACKGROUND:**
  Clean white paper texture background.]

- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  A minimalist, black-and-white flat vector illustration portrait of [CHARACTER NAME], rendered in the expressive "Notion avatar" art style.
  
  LINE WORK & VIBE:
  Style: Use THICK, UNIFORM black outlines (monoline weight). The lines should feel organic, smooth, and confident, not rigidly geometric or robotic like generic icons.
  Vibe: The character should have a distinct personality and a relaxed, cool, or friendly expression. Focus on stylized features, unique hairstyles, and defining accessories to convey character.
  
  SELECTIVE BLACK FILLS (CRITICAL):
  Unlike pure outline icons, utilize Solid Black Fills selectively and strategically.
  Where to Fill: Use solid black for prominent hair masses, beards, eyebrows, sunglasses, or dark clothing elements.
  Where to Keep White: The skin, main face area, and lighter elements must remain pure flat white inside the thick outlines.
  
  COMPOSITION & TECHNICAL:
  No shading, no gray tones, no gradients. Only pure Black and pure White.
  Clean bust or headshot composition centered on a white background.
  High contrast, clean 2D vector graphics.

  THE TASK:
  Deconstruct the brand identity of [BRAND NAME] into a playful, cohesive set of approximately 8-10 unique sticker designs arranged on a single sheet.
  Content Generation: Do not just make logos. Autonomously invent a mix of:
  Mascots/Characters: Stylized busts of people wearing brand-relevant accessories or expressing emotions.
  Key Products: Iconic items associated with the brand.
  Symbols/Objects: Abstract shapes or tools relevant to the brand's lifestyle.

  Coloring: The stickers must be filled with Solid Off-White or Cream, utilizing the line color for details. NO gradients, NO shading, NO 3D effects. Flat 2D vector look.
  The "Sticker" Effect: Every element must have a thick, distinct White (or Cream) Die-Cut Border surrounding it, separating it from the background.
  COLOR PALETTE (HIGH CONTRAST):
  Background: A solid, deep, saturated color to create maximum contrast.
  Stickers: High-brightness Cream or White fill with Dark (Black or Dark Brown) outlines.

  A flat, minimalist vector design featuring a highly stylized single letter monogram with the official brand logo below it, representing [BRAND NAME].
  
  **MAIN ELEMENT (THE MONOGRAM):**
  The center of the design features ONLY the single first letter of "[BRAND NAME]". The style is "Ornamental Vector Typography" with high calligraphic artistry, mimicking bespoke luxury monograms. This is not a standard font; it is a Highly customized, artistic glyph with elegant flourishes, exaggerated swashes, or ornamental serifs. The lines are clean, precise, and perfectly smooth vector graphics.
  
  **SECONDARY ELEMENT (BRAND IDENTIFIER):**
  Directly below the main stylized letter, positioned centrally, include the actual, original official logomark or logotype of "[BRAND NAME]". This element must be rendered significantly smaller than the main letter above it.
  
  **FINISH & TEXTURE (STRICT):**
  Absolutely zero texture, zero embossing, zero shadows, and zero gradients anywhere in the image. It must look like a perfectly flat digital illustration or screen print.
  
  **COLOR PALETTE (AI-DRIVEN & HIGH CONTRAST):**
  1.  **Background:** A single, solid, flat color block chosen by the AI to represent the vibe of [BRAND NAME].
  2.  **Main Monogram Color:** A single, solid, flat color that creates a sharp, high contrast against the background.
  3.  **Secondary Logo Color:** The small official logo below must be monochrome. It must be EITHER solid white OR solid dark gray—chosen automatically based on whichever offers the best readability against the chosen background color.

### 6.2 Fast Food Leather Bag
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2005288633839096050
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME]. A high-end conceptual leather clutch designed in the exact shape and silhouette of a classic disposable paper lunch sack (rolled top, rectangular base, NO HANDLES). The object is floating weightlessly in the center.
  
  **CRITICAL SHAPE & FORM:**
  The object must mimic a folded paper lunch bag. It has jagged/crimped cut edges at the top opening. The top is rolled or folded over casually. It must NOT have any handles or straps.
  
  **CREATIVE COLOR PALETTE & BRANDING:**
  The AI must act as a color stylist. Do not default to standard brand colors. Generate a unique, bold, fashion-forward color combination.
  * **Bag Color:** A vivid, unexpected luxury tone (e.g., Electric Lime, Deep Ultraviolet, Burnt Orange, or Cobalt Blue).
  * **Logo Size & Color:** A **medium-sized, centrally placed** `[BRAND NAME]` logo is deeply embossed on the front. Do NOT make the logo huge or oversized; keep it proportional and elegant with plenty of negative space around it. The logo is stamped with a highly contrasting color (e.g., White logo on Blue bag) to make it readable.
  
  **MATERIALS:**
  Ultra-premium, soft-grain calfskin leather that mimics the crinkles and folds of paper. Hyper-realistic leather texture.
  
  **ENVIRONMENT & BACKGROUND:**
  A seamless, perfectly clean, pure white studio cyclorama background. High-key brightly lit environment.
  
  **LIGHTING & ATMOSPHERE:**
  High-key editorial lighting. A strong backlighting setup creates a glowing "light aura" (halation) around the edges of the bag against the white background. The edges are slightly blown out.
  
  **CAMERA:**
  Medium format, 100mm lens, f/5.6. Slight shallow depth of field (sharp logo, soft back).

### 6.3 Branded Crumpled Stickers
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2011878056755966363
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  A sharp, top-down macro photograph of a single, heavily crumpled circular vinyl sticker featuring the official [BRAND NAME] logo.
  
  MATERIAL & TEXTURE (VINYL):
  The sticker is made of durable, slight-gloss vinyl material, not paper. It is severely crinkled with sharp, defined ridges and deep stress folds across its entire surface. Unlike soft paper creases, these vinyl wrinkles show plastic stress and catch the light with subtle specular highlights on the peaks of the folds. The edges are slightly curled from wear.
  COLOR PALETTE (BRAND DYNAMIC):
  The background color of the circular sticker itself is the dominant primary color associated with [BRAND NAME]'s official brand palette (e.g., if Ferrari, red; if John Deere, green). The logo is printed clearly in its standard contrasting color (e.g., white or black).
  LIGHTING (STUDIO BRIGHT):
  Bright, clean, high-key overhead white studio lighting. This intense lighting creates strong, clean highlights on the vinyl's crumpled ridges and defined, crisp shadows in the valleys, dramatically emphasizing the 3D topography of the damage.
  BACKGROUND & COMPOSITION:
  The camera is locked in a strict, perfectly parallel top-down flat lay view. The sticker is adhered flat onto a pure white plastic surface which has a subtle, fine granular texture (like bead-blasted plastic) to provide tactile contrast to the smooth vinyl. The entire sticker is in sharp focus.

### 6.4 Premium Beverage Package Design
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2009635875953488106
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME]. 
  Act as a world-class product photographer creating an ultra-high-end editorial shot of a luxury beverage bottle.
  
  COMPOSITION (FULL VIEW):
  A full-body studio photograph showing the entire bottle from base to cap, centered in the frame. The bottle stands on a seamless surface.
  
  THE VESSEL & COLORS (MATERIALITY):
  Bottle Body: Premium, opaque matte white ceramic with a fine, powdery texture.
  Bottle Cap: A premium matte or satin-finish cap colored exactly in [BRAND NAME]'s primary brand color.
  
  LIGHTING & BACKGROUND (COLORED STUDIO):
  The background is a seamless, smooth studio cyclorama flooded with [BRAND NAME]'s primary brand color, creating a rich, immersive color environment.
  Lighting: Sophisticated, high-end white studio lighting (large softboxes). The light must be soft and wrapping, creating elegant highlights along the ceramic edges to define form.
  
  CENTRAL BRANDING (ULTRA-PRECISION MICRO-EMBOSSING):
  The main Gothic/Blackletter [BRAND NAME] text is centered on the bottle.
  CRITICAL TEXTURE FIX: The text is rendered with ultra-subtle, shallow precision micro-embossing (maximum 0.2mm to 0.3mm depth). It must NOT look like applied clay or a heavy badge. It should look like a crisp, shallow tooling mark integrated perfectly into the ceramic surface, defined only by very subtle light catching the edges.
  Color: The embossed text itself is colored in [BRAND NAME]'s primary brand color, perhaps with a slight semi-gloss finish to contrast subtly with the matte white bottle.
  
  TYPOGRAPHIC HIERARCHY (AUXILIARY DETAILS):
  All auxiliary text is printed cleanly in a neutral dark grey/black (monochrome) to sit quietly on the white surface:
  Top Micro-Blocks: Two very small lines above main text (e.g., "LIMITED EDITION // BATCH 001").
  Flavor Name: Below main text, a beautiful, smaller, unobtrusive font for the flavor.
  Volume/Specs: Further down, technical info (e.g., "500ML").
  Ingredients Block: At the very bottom edge, a dense micro-print block.
  
  CORNER ELEMENTS:
  Top Right: Small, discrete monochrome Gothic brand name.
  Bottom Right: Small monochrome original brand logo.

- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME], visualized as a single, defining product container in a severe ultra-minimalist, monochromatic "generic brand" aesthetic. The packaging is rendered in a realistic matte white material that physically mimics the specific texture of the original product (e.g., crinkled foil for bags, rigid cardboard for boxes, or smooth plastic for bottles). The background is a pure, solid black studio environment.
  
  Design Rules:
  1. Typography: All text is solid black, using exclusively the Helvetica Bold typeface.
  2. Branding: The name of the brand entity is the central, dominant text.
  3. Graphics: Include a minimal, fine-line black outline or wireframe-style drawing of the brand's iconic logo shape or the product itself (e.g., outline of chips, burger wrapper, or symbol), avoiding solid black fills.
  4. Details: Include secondary text blocks in smaller Helvetica font below the main name to denote product variant (e.g., "Classic", "Original", "Premium") and standard technical data (Net Weight, Volume), mimicking a clinical, sterile layout.
  5. Lighting: Sharp, high-contrast studio lighting highlighting the white material textures against the black void.
  6. Composition: The entire product object must be completely visible and centered within the frame frame, with ample solid black negative space surrounding it on all sides, ensuring no part of the object is cropped.

The color of the passport cover is the dominant, signature color associated with the specified brand (e.g., black for luxury brands, red for Netflix, etc.). The branding strictly follows this three-tiered gold foil structure, meticulously replicated from the original Balenciaga style, but using the real-life brand logo:
  
  1. Top Line: The full name of the [Desired Brand] in gold, centered.
  2. Center Logo: The exact, real-life primary graphic logo/emblem of the specified brand (no lettering, only the graphic symbol), rendered in highly detailed gold foil, centered, mimicking a sophisticated embossed style.
  3. Middle Text: The word "PASSPORT" and "PASSEPORT" stacked in gold, centered.
  4. Bottom Symbol: A small, centered, stylized gold foil rectangle containing a two-letter or two-character monogram (e.g., 'NI' for Nike, 'AD' for Adidas), placed directly below the passport text, replicating the design structure of the small symbol seen at the bottom of the reference image.
  
  The single passport cover is perfectly centered and isolated on a clean, bright white background. No text, objects, documents, or accessories are visible outside of the passport cover itself.

### 7.1 Premium Sport Jersey
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2010426555843871121
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  [BRAND NAME]. Act as a fashion photographer and creative director shooting a high-end editorial lookbook for a bespoke football jersey designed by this brand.
  THE SUBJECT & COMPOSITION (FLOATING & ANGLED):
  A single, premium custom football jersey is floating suspended in mid-air, centered in the frame. There is no hanger visible.
  Crucial Angle: The jersey is NOT presented flatly frontal. It is rotated slightly (approximately 15 degrees angled view) to show depth, form, and a dynamic profile. Despite floating, the fabric must show realistic weight, deep gravity-defying folds, creases, and natural wrinkles. It must feel like a real, heavy garment frozen in time, not a stiff 3D model.
  BRANDED DESIGN & AESTHETICS:
  The jersey's design is a sophisticated interpretation of [BRAND NAME]'s visual identity.
  Branding Placement: The official [BRAND NAME] logo is authentically applied as the main club crest on the chest (e.g., embroidered patch or high-quality heat transfer).
  MATERIALITY & TEXTURE (CRITICAL):
  The focus remains on luxurious, tactile textures.
  Fabric: A heavyweight, retro-inspired athletic cotton-blend or technical knit with a visible, coarse weave structure.
  ENVIRONMENT & BACKGROUND (WHITE STUDIO):
  The jersey floats within an abstract, infinite white photo studio cyclorama space. The background is completely seamless, pure, clean white, and minimalist, with absolutely zero distractions, placing total focus on the suspended garment.
  LIGHTING & PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE:
  Style: Hyper-realistic editorial fashion photography. Clean, high-key aesthetic.
  Lighting: sophisticated studio lighting. Soft, diffused light that sculpts the folds of the fabric and highlights the texture against the pure white background. Subtle soft shadows might be cast on the jersey itself to define its form in the white space.

### 7.2 Photo Campaign for Any Brand
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2007890867626057901
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  A high-end, hyper-realistic editorial fashion photography triptych campaign for brand: [BRAND NAME].
  THE TASK:
  Act as a world-class fashion photographer (e.g., Steven Meisel, Paolo Roversi, or Harley Weir) shooting a defining image campaign for [BRAND NAME]. You must create a cohesive 3-panel editorial layout, stacked horizontally (top, middle, bottom panels). The focus is intensely on cinematic close-ups and textural details.
  THE MUSE (AI AUTONOMY):
  Analyze the deepest archetype, aesthetic, philosophy, and target audience lifestyle of [BRAND NAME]. Based only on this analysis, autonomously generate the ultimate human muse for the brand. You determine their gender, age, unique ethnicity, striking features, and charismatic attitude. This person is not a model posing; they are the living embodiment of the brand's spirit.
  THE TRIPTYCH NARRATIVE & COMPOSITION (HORIZONTAL STACK - CLOSE-UP FOCUS):
  The three stacked panels must form a unified, intimate visual essay about the brand's essence, prioritizing tight framing.
  Top Panel (The Intense Portrait): A cinematic, tight headshot focusing on the eyes and face. Intense, communicative gaze. Highlighting skin texture and emotion.
  Middle Panel (The Gesture/Action): A tight crop focusing on a specific body part in motion or repose—hands clutching something, the curve of a neck, a mouth smoking a cigarette, posture. It conveys the character's attitude without showing the whole body.
  Bottom Panel (The Ultimate Texture/Symbol): An extreme macro close-up. A detail of a unique garment fabric, a piece of jewelry, a symbolic prop relevant to the brand's lifestyle, or an abstract texture from their environment.
  STYLING & BOLD CHOICES (CRITICAL):
  Push boundaries. The styling must be avant-garde high fashion. Incorporate unexpected elements to create an "art-house" feel: weird accessories, juxtaposed garments, props, or even a touch of deliberate absurdity if it fits the brand's vibe. The image must feel raw, expensive, and tactile.
  TECHNICAL AESTHETICS:
  Hyper-realism: Strong film grain, highly detailed textures (pores, fabric weave), realistic depth of field.
  Lighting: Bold, cinematic, and dramatic. Use chiaroscuro, colored gels, harsh sunlight, or moody shadows depending on the brand's DNA.
  Color: A sophisticated, editorial color grading palette that is perfectly harmonious and relevant to [BRAND NAME].

### 8.2 American Retro-lettering
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/2008176822551216467
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  A bold, vibrant, retro-American vector lettering design displaying the name "Figma".
  
  TYPOGRAPHY STYLE (FAT SCRIPT):
  The text is rendered in a thick, chunky, hand-lettered "baseball script" or "bubble" style, reminiscent of 1950s-1970s American sports logos and automotive decals.
  Form: The letters are heavy, rounded, and tightly connected (ligatures).
  Perspective: The text line should be slightly slanted upwards or arched to create dynamic energy.
  Effects: Apply a thick, bold outline around the text. Crucially, add a deep, solid "block shadow" (extrusion) behind the letters to create a heavy 3D pop-out effect, characteristic of vintage sticker art.
  
  COLOR PALETTE (BRAND VINTAGE):
  Use a bright, saturated, and flat color palette inspired by [BRAND NAME]'s identity but filtered through a retro pop-art lens.
  Fill: Solid, punchy colors (no gradients).
  Contrast: High contrast between the letter fill, the outline (usually white or cream), and the block shadow (usually a darker shade or contrasting color).
  
  DECORATIVE ELEMENTS:
  Keep it clean and vector-like. You may include subtle, classic "Americana" design elements integrated into the text flow, such as a "swoosh" underline, a simple star, or a very simplified icon relevant to the brand (e.g., a lightning bolt for energy, a leaf for eco). Do NOT over-detail; keep it looking like a printed logo.
  
  BACKGROUND:
  Isolated on a clean, pure white background. No paper textures, no noise, no dirt.

  [BRAND NAME]. 
  Act as a master engraver creating a refined, minimalist "19th Century Heritage" logomark.
  STYLE & TECHNIQUE (FINE LINE ETCHING):
  The style is strictly "Copperplate Engraving" or "Scientific Botanical Illustration" style from the 1800s.
  Line Quality: Use incredibly thin, delicate hairlines. Do NOT create heavy, bold, or dark shapes. Use subtle cross-hatching only for minimal shading. The image should look light, airy, and precise.
  No Heavy Borders: Do NOT enclose the logo in a heavy shield, crest, or thick frame. The composition must be OPEN and AIRY, floating on the page with generous negative space.
  THE REIMAGINED SYMBOL:
  Reinterpret the [BRAND NAME] logo as a vintage, hand-drawn illustration.
  Example: If the brand is technological, draw it as a vintage mechanical drafting. If it's organic, draw it as a refined nature etching.
  Key Visual: It should look like an illustration found in an expensive 19th-century encyclopedia or on a royal bank note.
  TYPOGRAPHY (CLASSICAL ELEGANCE):
  The brand name is written in a sophisticated High-Contrast Roman Serif font (Didone style).
  Kerning: Wide, elegant letter spacing.

### 8.6 Swiss Design Typographic Poster
- **Thread:** https://x.com/i/status/1999038204692083196
- **Prompt:**
  ```text
  A minimalist Swiss Design poster for the work entitled "[TITLE]".
  
  The design is defined by an ascetic, legible, and bold sans-serif typography, laid out on a clean, neutral background with a strict, grid-based composition. The title is the dominant typographic element, rendered in a strong, clean font.
  
  A large, frosted, semi-translucent glass overlay, like a textured panel or a thick lens, partially covers the typography and the background, acting as the primary view magnet. This glass element creates a subtle distortion, refraction, or blurring effect on the text and shapes beneath it, adding depth and a tactile quality.
  
  The color palette is monochrome or strictly limited to muted, sophisticated tones. The overall aesthetic is clean, intellectual, and highly organized, with soft studio lighting emphasizing the texture of the glass and the paper. Additional, smaller typographic elements (like a subtitle, date, or author's name, relevant to the work) are placed with precision around the main title.
