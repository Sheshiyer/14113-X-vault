**Prompt:**
> "Man walking down the street in 1980s NYC.
>
> [cut] Close-up shot: the man sees something unexpected in front of him.
>
> [cut] Over-the-shoulder shot: in front of him, a flower stand named Donna, with an old lady selling flowers.
>
> [cut] Back shot of the man walking up to the flower stand.
>
> No music, no talking."

**Prompt:**
> "Girl standing still and looking through the window.
>
> [cut] Close-up shot of the cat purring on the sofa.
>
> [cut] Back medium shot of the girl standing still and looking through the window.
>
> [cut] Wide shot: the cat jumps off the sofa.
>
> No music, no talking."

## Step 4: Cat Insert Shots (Consistency)
Generate quick cat insert shots to reuse later and keep interaction consistent.
**Video:** [cat_inserts.mp4](cat_inserts.mp4)

**Prompt:**
> "Girl standing still and looking through the window.
>
> [cut] cat jumps off the sofa.
>
> [cut] front shot of the cat sitting on the floor by the sofa.
>
> [cut] different shots of cat playing with a tomato on the floor.
>
> no music, no talking."

## Step 5: Kissing Scene (Grok)
For romantic content (Sora restrictions), use Grok with a custom source image.
*   **Preparation:** Screenshot characters at required angles and create a new source image.
**Image:** [kissing_source.jpg](kissing_source.jpg)
**Video:** [kissing_scene.mp4](kissing_scene.mp4)

**Prompt:**
> "Woman kisses the man, camera still."
