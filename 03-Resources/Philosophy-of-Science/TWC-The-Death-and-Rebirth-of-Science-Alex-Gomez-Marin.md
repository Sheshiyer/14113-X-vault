# The Death and Rebirth of Science (Alex Gomez-Marin)

## Summary
A reading and commentary on an article by theoretical physicist and neuroscientist Alex Gomez-Marin titled "Scientific Publishing is a Multi-Million Dollar Ponzi Scheme," which serves as an inadvertent prologue to the FormScapes project's next essay on esoteric science. The article diagnoses how scientific publishing has been gamed to advance careers rather than knowledge, how science journalism has become a mechanism of public indoctrination, and how the "Unholy Trinity" of mechanistic reductive materialism, dogmatic skepticism, and naive atheism has been institutionalized as scientism.

## Key Insights
- Scientific publishing operates as a Ponzi scheme: top journals charge obscene fees to publish taxpayer-funded results while scientists peer-review for free, and reviews function more as censorship than critical appraisal
- Science journalism has become indoctrination: prominent communicators substitute certitude for curiosity, conflating their dogmatic views with science itself
- The "Unholy Trinity" of institutionalized scientism: mechanistic reductive materialism + dogmatic skepticism + naive atheism
- Scientism is more dangerous than pseudoscience because it is an inside job -- arrogance is antithetical to progress
- The problem is a triangular industrial complex of academia, journalism, and education that selects for and reinforces these failings at every checkpoint
- The scientists of the future need intellectual humility, epistemic vulnerability, and metaphysical sincerity

## Themes & Patterns
- Crisis of institutional science from within
- The publish-or-perish economy as corruption engine
- Science communication as power structure
- The need for heterodox intellectual courage
- Education reform as prerequisite for scientific renewal
