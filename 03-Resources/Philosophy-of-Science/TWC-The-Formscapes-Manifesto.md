# The Formscapes Manifesto

## Summary
A foundational statement for the FormScapes philosophical project, arguing that the most significant development of the past 500 years -- modern science -- has painted itself into epistemological and metaphysical corners. The video critiques how empiricism has degenerated into reliance on expensive machines producing arcane data interpretable only by an elite clergy, and how science has become a self-confirmation engine propped up by theoretical presumptions built into its own hardware and software.

## Key Insights
- Modern science began as Protestant-humanist liberation from institutional mediation of truth but has ironically recreated the very priesthood structure it sought to overthrow
- The empiricist conviction in the primacy of human experience has been replaced by faith in machines whose theoretical presuppositions are built into their hardware and software
- Scientific progress is stalling relative to the revolutionary breakthroughs of a century ago, despite relentless technological innovation
- The great scientific monuments of the postmodern world have become self-confirmation engines rather than instruments of genuine discovery
- The core principles of corporeality -- difference and repetition -- explain why mathematical physics succeeds in the crystalline domain but fails to capture animacy and purposive causality

## Themes & Patterns
- Science as new priesthood (enantiodromia of the Enlightenment)
- Epistemological crisis of modernity
- The distinction between corporeal and noetic realms
- Mechanistic materialism as ideology rather than empiricism
- The FormScapes project as philosophical alternative
