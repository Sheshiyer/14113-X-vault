## Key Points
- **Definition:** Behaviorism is the doctrine that psychology is the science of behavior, not the mind. Behavior can be explained without ultimate reference to mental events.
- **Three Types:**
    1.  **Methodological Behaviorism:** Psychology should concern itself with behavior of organisms, not mental states (John Watson).
    2.  **Psychological Behaviorism:** Explains behavior in terms of external stimuli, responses, learning histories, and reinforcement (Pavlov, Thorndike, Skinner).
    3.  **Analytical/Logical Behaviorism:** Mental terms are just behavioral dispositions (Ryle, Wittgenstein).
- **Roots:** Logical Positivism (verificationism), Classical Associationism (Locke, Hume).
- **Skinner's Radical Behaviorism:** Combines all three types. Rejects internal processing as an explanation (circularity). Views "inner behavior" (thinking) as subject to the same laws as overt behavior.
- **Criticisms:**
    - **Chomsky:** Language acquisition (poverty of stimulus) suggests innate structures, not just reinforcement.
    - **Qualia:** Behaviorism cannot account for the subjective "feel" of experience (pain).
    - **Cognitive Science:** Behavior without cognition is blind. Internal representation is necessary to explain complex behavior.
- **Legacy:** Elements survive in behavior therapy (CBT), animal learning theory, and neuroeconomics.

## Content

### 1. What is Behaviorism?
Behaviorism is a doctrine committed to three claims:
1.  Psychology is the science of behavior, not the inner mind.
2.  Behavior can be described and explained without ultimate reference to mental events or internal psychological processes. Sources of behavior are external (environment).
3.  Mental terms should be eliminated or translated into behavioral concepts.

### 2. Three Types of Behaviorism
*   **Methodological behaviorism:** A normative theory about the scientific conduct of psychology. It claims psychology should not concern itself with mental states. (John Watson).
*   **Psychological behaviorism:** A research program explaining behavior via stimuli, responses, and reinforcement. (Pavlov, Thorndike, Skinner).
*   **Analytical (Logical) behaviorism:** A philosophical theory about the meaning of mental terms. "Belief" is a behavioral disposition. (Gilbert Ryle, Ludwig Wittgenstein).

### 3. Roots of Behaviorism
*   **Logical Positivism:** Verificationism grounds analytical behaviorism.
*   **Classical Associationism:** British Empiricists (Locke, Hume). Psychological behaviorism is associationism without inner mental events.

### 4. Popularity of Behaviorism
Dominant from the 1920s to 1950s.
*   **Philosophers:** Carnap, Hempel, Quine.
*   **Psychologists:** Pavlov, Skinner, Thorndike, Watson, Tolman, Hull, Guthrie.
*   **Applications:** Behavior therapy, token economies.

### 5. Why be a Behaviorist?
1.  **Epistemic:** Behavioral evidence is the only public evidence for mental states.
2.  **Anti-Nativism:** Rejects innate rules/structures (unlike mentalism/Chomsky). Learning is response-oriented.
3.  **Avoidance of Circularity:** Explaining behavior by "inner behavior" (homunculi) is regressive. Skinner argues we must turn to external forces.

### 6. Skinner’s Social Worldview
Skinner proposed a society based on behaviorist principles (*Walden Two*). He rejected free will and autonomy, arguing that the environment controls behavior. Critics argue his vision lacks detail on conflict resolution and institutional arrangements.

### 7. Why be Anti-Behaviorist?
*   **Cognitive Science Revolution:** Replaced behaviorism. Emphasizes internal information processing.
*   **Qualia:** Behaviorism fails to account for the phenomenal quality of experience (e.g., the painfulness of pain).
*   **Chomsky's Critique:** Language acquisition in children (lexical explosion) cannot be explained by reinforcement alone. It requires innate grammatical structures.
*   **Neuroscience:** While Skinner acknowledged the brain, he saw it as implementing environmental connections. Modern neuroscience (and neuroeconomics) sees the brain as an active interpretation machine.

### 8. Conclusion
Behaviorism has declined but not disappeared. It survives in behavior therapy, animal modeling, and neuroeconomics. However, the consensus is that psychology must use psychological (cognitive) terms to explain behavior fully.
