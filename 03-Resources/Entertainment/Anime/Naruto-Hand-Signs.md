•How to: Basic Naruto Hand-Signs•
Hello-o! It's Razz, and I wanted to do something unique. I'm a bit of a nerd, and have always tried (and failed) to do and learn some of the jutsu signs in Naruto.
I hope that y'all are nerds like I am, and enjoy recreating jutsus too :>
As a bonus, I'll be showing the basic signs of:
- Shadow Clone Jutsu
- Chidori
- Katon - Fireball Jutsu
- Summoning Jutsu
Before I tell you that, we're going to have to learn the basic hand signs. (And how to do them)
Alrighty, so there's 12 basic Jutsu signs. There are special signs for unique jutsus (like Ino's Mind Transfer Jutsu) but this is just the basic set. I apologize if some are a tidbit confusing! (Some were difficult to describe). Also, make sure to refer to the image above if you get stuck.
EX: •Animal (Romaji word for animal)•
•Ox (Ushi)•
For this sign, you take your left hand and lay it horizontally (see picture). Take your right hand and weave your fingers in between your left hands'. Take the middle and ring finger lay it on your right hand.
•Dog (Inu)•
This one is fairly simple. All you have to do is take your left hand and curl it into a fist. Lay it horizontally. Then, take your right hand and lay it flat on the top of your left hand!
•Boar (I)•
This is also very simple. Take both your hands and curl your fingers (and thumb) but keep the first segment of them straight. Join your hands and point them downwards.
•Serpent (Mi)•
Easiest one of all, probably. All you have to do is clasp your hands together. (Like when Nagato performs Rinne Rebirth).
•Hare (U)•
Take your right hand and make a finger gun (If you don't know what that is, simply do the same thing that you would if you were to point at something, but instead keep the thumb straight up). Lay your left hand horizontally. Take your left hand and curl all your fingers inwards except for the pinky.
•Ram (Hitsuji)•
Ah, the classic. This is the one you'll always see Naruto do when forming his fabulous Kage Bunshins. Anyway, take both of your hands and make a peace sign, but the middle and index fingers are joined. Slide your left hand between your right hand pinky, ring, and thumb. Curl the left hand's fingers around the right hand, and do the same for the right hand.
•Tiger (Tora)•
This one is pretty easy. Form the Serpent sign (scroll up a bit) but keep your index fingers and thumbs pointed up.
•Rat (Ne)•
Take your right hand and form a peace sign, but with the middle and index fingers joined. Take your left hand and curl your fingers around the middle and index fingers. (To be more detailed, your left hand's fingers should only be curled around the middle finger. The thumb curls around the index finger).
•Monkey (Saru)•
Very simple. Just take your right hand and lay it horizontal to yourself. Lay your left hand on top. Curl the left hand's thumb around the right hand's pinky. Do the same for the right hand's thumb.
•Horse (Uma)•
This one is pretty tough, so bear with me on this. (I suggest referring to the image a lot). Take both your hands and make the same shape you would if you were to point at something, but keep the first segment of them straight. Bend your thumbs so it's curled onto the side of your hands. Separate your fingers (besides thumb) a little bit. Now comes the hardest part!
Take your hands and "stack" your fingers (excluding thumb & index). Stack them on top of eachother's first joints. If that's confusing, look at your fingers. The first part where it bends (no, not the knuckles, a bit higher) is where you stack your fingers. Now just point the index fingers together to make a triangle.
•Dragon (Tatsu)•
Take your hands and insert your fingers together. Each finger should be in between another finger. The two pinkies should be joined together. The two thumbs should be overlapped, with the left thumb on top.
•Bird (Tori)•
Take both hands, and make the "surfer dude" sign. If you don't know what that is, just point your thumb and pinky outwards and keep your index finger pointed upward. Your middle and ring finger stays curled downward.
Alright, now connect your index fingers and pinkies. Take your thumbs and bend them so the second joints are put together, and the nails are facing each other. Now, sort of do the same thing when you make the "Dragon" sign. Stack the middle and ring fingers on top of each other. (If you look at the image, the middle finger of your right hand should be the first finger).
Yosh! Now, onto the jutsus themselves.
(Note that a lot of the time, the jutsus often are shortened in the shows. These are the longer ways to do them.
The normal hand signs for this jutsu is:
Ram, Serpent, and Tiger
(I say normal, because what Naruto does is only one sign).
Ox, Hare, Monkey
Or (if you want the challenge)
Monkey, Dragon, Rat, Bird, Ox, Serpent, Dog, Tiger, Monkey
Serpent, Ram, Monkey, Boar, Horse, Tiger
Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Ram
Then bite your thumb and slam it on the ground!
Aaaaand thank you for reading! I hope you guys enjoyed this post, and drop a like if you did!

(PS: If you saw the Zabuza episode, some jutsus can get intense. Did you see the number of signs in that Water Dragon Jutsu? Sweet Hokage).
