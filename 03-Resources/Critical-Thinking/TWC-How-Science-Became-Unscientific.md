# How Science Became Unscientific

## Summary

A thorough critical examination of modern institutional science, arguing that science has degenerated from a genuine practice of inquiry into a doctrinal priesthood of authorized beliefs. The video traces this deterioration through Robert Maxwell's creation of the academic publishing racket, the replication crisis (with two-thirds of psychological/medical findings failing to replicate), the failure of Karl Popper's falsificationism as exposed by Thomas Kuhn's paradigm theory, the mechanistic metaphor's inadequacy revealed by quantum theory, the unresolved contradiction between general relativity and quantum field theory, the dark matter hypothesis, the vacuum energy catastrophe, and James Webb Space Telescope observations that contradict standard cosmological models. The video critiques science popularizers who use "crackpot" labeling to suppress legitimate dissent.

## Key Insights

- The replication crisis reveals that as many as two-thirds of findings in psychology, sociology, and medicine cannot be replicated, with the most-cited studies often being the least replicable. Biomedical replication fails in over 80% of cases.
- Popper's falsificationism fails as a demarcation criterion because, as Kuhn showed, real scientific paradigms are never abandoned due to falsification alone; contradictory evidence is ignored, dismissed, or accommodated through ad hoc adjustments.
- The mechanistic machine metaphor underlying modern science was never simply an obvious given but was directly conditioned by the development of machine technologies, with laws of thermodynamics emerging from steam engine research and then being generalized to the entire cosmos.
- General relativity and quantum field theory are fundamentally incompatible (time as illusion vs. time as objectively real), yet this contradiction has been largely ignored rather than resolved, with 100 years of failed attempts at quantum gravity.
- The vacuum energy catastrophe represents the worst theoretical prediction in physics, off by 120 orders of magnitude, while the James Webb Space Telescope reveals morphologically mature galaxies that should not exist according to standard cosmological timelines.
- Science apologists deploy the label "pseudoscience" and "crackpot" not on methodological grounds but to enforce doctrinal conformity, as demonstrated by the Royal Society's attempted suppression of the "New Trends in Evolution" conference.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Institutional Capture**: Science has been captured by institutional, financial, and professional incentive structures that reward conformity and punish genuine inquiry, tracing back to Robert Maxwell's publishing monopoly.
- **The Science vs. Science**: A distinction between "the science" (doctrinal body of authorized beliefs) and actual science (practice of direct engagement with nature), with the former functioning as a fundamentally religious structure.
- **Metaphysical Blindness**: The refusal to engage with the metaphysical presuppositions underlying scientific paradigms has allowed a rigidified mechanistic framework to persist long past its usefulness.
- **Power and Knowledge**: The sociology of scientific authority mirrors religious priesthood structures, with the demarcation problem serving ideological rather than epistemological functions.

## Transcript Excerpt

> in my opinion this video is in all seriousness the most important video which I have created for this channel thus far this video isn't going to be presenting or evaluating any particular Theory developed by myself or other thinkers rather in this video I'm going to be attempting to take an uncomfortably honest look at the nature of modern science at the epistemological playing field of modern cu
