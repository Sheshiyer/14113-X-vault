# Downloading the Pleroma; Dialogue with The Shared Story

## Summary
A long-form dialogue between The Whole Critter and Christopher from The Shared Story channel, exploring their parallel spiritual journeys from atheism/materialism to esoteric metaphysics. Both describe independent "download" experiences that catalyzed radical worldview shifts. They discuss Christopher's chakra-based cosmogram, correlations with tarot and Chinese elements, the void/nothingness as integral to divinity, Star Wars as a decoded hero's journey mapped onto the chakras, and the convergence between consciousness-first science and empirical esotericism. The conversation touches on Rudolph Steiner's empirical spirituality, Goethe's color theory, and the danger of solipsistic idealism in consciousness-first frameworks.

## Key Insights
- **Independent convergent spiritual downloads**: Both hosts describe sudden, overnight transformative experiences -- Christopher's in January 2013 after 39 years of atheism, TWC's in summer 2020 after escaping a destructive relationship and getting sober. Both describe receiving "downloads" of spiritual information that radically reoriented their perception of reality.
- **The cosmogram as universal structure**: Christopher's chart, TWC's chromogram, and Galahad's vision all converge on the same underlying structure despite being developed independently. This spontaneous convergence across unconnected individuals suggests contact with an objective underlying reality rather than subjective fabrication.
- **Nothingness as generative divine darkness**: Western tradition treats nothingness as negative, but Eastern traditions (sunyata, anatta, Brahman) and Western mystics (Meister Eckhart's "groundless ground," Nicholas of Cusa's "luminous darkness") reveal nothingness as the generative womb of being. The void is not absence of divinity but an integral aspect of it.
- **Danger of consciousness-first solipsism**: Donald Hoffman's "heads-up display" model of consciousness and similar frameworks risk imprisoning us in private subjectivity where we never access reality itself. TWC pushes back, following Steiner's lead: we should be able to see spiritual realities with sensory and super-sensory faculties. The world itself has color, taste, emotion, and meaning -- not just our internal representations.
- **Modern civilization as chrysalis**: Under normal pre-modern conditions, a culture as psychologically dysfunctional as ours would have perished. Techno-capitalism serves as a cocoon preventing species extinction while the cultural caterpillar liquefies and reconfigures itself, potentially toward a planetary spiritual awakening.

## Transcript Excerpt
> All right. So, Christopher, hi. So, we have chatted a bit, but not too much. So, presumably this is going to end up on one of, if not both of our YouTube channels. So, for my audience, hi, this is Christopher from a channel called The Shared Story, which has some really interesting content regarding the chakras and mythweaving...
