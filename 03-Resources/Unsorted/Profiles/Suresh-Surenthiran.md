You're trying to convince your boss to invest in a new technology. How do you explain its value?
To showcase the new technology's value, analyse current limitations: what can't it do? Then, research future education trends and promising technologies. Combine that with competitor analysis and student needs to create a framework for a modern learning environment. Quantify the benefits: cost savings, efficiency gains, improved student engagement (e.g., "students will run after you"). Tailor your explanation to your specific field and highlight the technology's role in achieving this vision. Remember, professionalism refers to clarity, focus on benefits, and aligning your proposal with the organisation's goals.
