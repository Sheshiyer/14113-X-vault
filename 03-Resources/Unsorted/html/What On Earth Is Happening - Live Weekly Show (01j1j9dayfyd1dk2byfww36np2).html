<p>In this special presentation, originally given at <a href="https://www.anarchapulco.com">Anarchapulco</a> 2023: Resist, Mark Passio explains to the anarchist community what the ONLY Solution to the Human Condition of Slavery truly is. Mark details that the true solution to tyranny does not lie in creating anything “new,” but instead to morally educate the general population to such an extent that they cease and desist in conducting the immoral behaviors that allows Human Slavery to continue largely unchallenged. For those who want to see real Freedom manifested in our world, this is a powerful talk that is not to be missed.</p>

<p>Hello, and welcome to <strong>What On Earth Is Happening</strong>, the official web site of <strong>Mark Passio</strong>. This body of work is a culmination of many years of my extensive research and investigation into the nature of our shared reality.</p>
<p>Through my presentations, videos and podcasts, I take my guests on a journey of <strong>self-exploration</strong>, examining human <strong>Consciousness</strong> and the way it relates to the universal problems which we currently face as a species. Some of the questions I attempt to answer are:</p>
<p>Who <strong>are</strong> we? What is our <strong>purpose</strong>? Why do we hold certain <strong>beliefs</strong>? Why do we tend to <strong>see</strong> ourselves and others in a certain way? Why do we <strong>act</strong> the way we do toward ourselves and others? What does any of this have to do with the <strong>events</strong> we <strong>experience</strong> in our world?</p>
<p>Having successfully begun my work as a presenter of the message of <strong>spiritual awareness</strong>, I am now taking a pro-active approach to the task of spreading this significant information to others. This has resulted in <strong>What On Earth Is Happening</strong>, a penetrating analysis into the realm of human <strong>Consciousness</strong>.</p>
<p>In this <strong>empowering</strong> presentation, and on this web site, the following concepts and ideas will be deeply explored:</p>
<figure><img alt="index-circles" src="https://www.whatonearthishappening.com/images/woeih/welcome/woeih-circles.png"/></figure>
<p>• The components of our own <strong>Consciousness<br/>
</strong>• How to recognize <strong>Truth</strong> and <strong>Deception<br/>
</strong>• The <strong>Emotional Polarities</strong> we experience in our lives<br/>
• The differences between <strong>Magic</strong> and <strong>Sorcery<br/>
</strong>• What a healthy or destructive <strong>Worldview</strong> looks like<br/>
• The basic nature of <strong>Good</strong> and <strong>Evil<br/>
</strong>• The basic nature of the <strong>problem</strong> we collectively face as a species<br/>
• The forces of <strong>Dark Occultism</strong> at work in our lives<br/>
• The multi-faceted <strong>methods</strong> by which human consciousness is <strong>manipulated</strong> on a daily basis<br/>
• The underlying <strong>agenda</strong> of those performing the manipulation<br/>
• What <strong>Natural Law</strong> is and how it contrasts with the law of man<br/>
• What <strong>Sovereignty</strong> and <strong>Anarchy</strong> really mean<br/>
<strong>• Grassroots Solutions</strong> that anyone can employ to begin to turn the tide and heal the damage that has been done to our ourselves and our world</p>
<p>The scope of this work is enormous in scale and a wide variety of seemingly unrelated topics will be covered. Each of these topics are large enough in scope that they could be considered separate studies unto themselves. The intention is not to cover each topic exhaustively, but to present an overall <strong>tapestry</strong> from which a larger picture may emerge in the minds of viewers and listeners.</p>
<p>Rather than absorbing this information from a purely analytical point of view, it is suggested that one would benefit much more by simply going over the material with an <strong>open mind</strong> and an <strong>open heart</strong>, and try to feel the information that is being presented from an <strong>intuitive</strong> point of view. Ask yourself if what you are hearing resonates with your <strong>inner knowing</strong>.</p>
<p>None of the information contained within this web site or in the presentation are my own ideas or <strong>beliefs</strong>. It is simply information about the world in which we live that I have come to <strong>understand</strong> and that I feel others could benefit by also understanding.</p>
<p><em><strong>In no way am I asking anyone to BELIEVE anything that is contained in my presentations or on this web site.</strong></em></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the absolute worst thing that could happen is that you leave here <strong>believing</strong> anything you've read, without seeking to <strong>verify</strong> it through <strong>your own research</strong> and in <strong>your own experience</strong>. The whole purpose of this body of work is to encourage others to seek the <strong>knowledge</strong> that can lead them to a better understanding of themselves, and of our world.</p>
<p>Finally, I would ask you to consider that, regardless of the circumstances or events that led you to this site, <strong>it is not an accident</strong> that you have found it. We are led to certain experiences <strong>for a reason</strong>.</p>
<p>So if you are now ready to begin, my recommendation is to start with the Podcast section by clicking on the "Podcasts" tab of the main menu above. <strong>Proceeding in order is recommended</strong>, starting with show #001 and moving forward, as concepts explored in the later podcasts are built upon prerequisite information which is covered in earlier shows. Please keep in mind that this web site is a <strong>work in progress</strong>. New information and resources will be added on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>So <strong>thank you very much</strong> for visiting my site. If you find any of the information contained on these pages of value to your life, please feel free to <strong>share it widely</strong>, and recommend the site to others.</p>
<p><strong>All is Love. Fear is Illusion. All beings are Free. Truth can never be destroyed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mark Passio<br/>
