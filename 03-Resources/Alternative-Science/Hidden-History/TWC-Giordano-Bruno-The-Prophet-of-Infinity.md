# Giordano Bruno; The Prophet of Infinity

## Summary
A detailed exploration of Giordano Bruno's cosmology as a metaphysics of liberation, positioned against both Aristotelian Christian scholasticism and nominalism. The video traces the friction between the need for human moral freedom and the deterministic implications of Aristotelian ousia (substance), showing how the nominalists and Bruno each offered different solutions. Bruno's monadology -- wherein each monad is a spark of the cosmic soul possessing pure self-determination -- provided a third category of being (neither matter nor psyche) that allowed genuine human freedom, while his rejection of original sin and vision of infinite creative cosmos ultimately led to his execution by burning in 1600.

## Key Insights
- **Aristotelian ousia and the problem of freedom**: Within Aristotelian metaphysics, identity (ousia) is a particular conjugation of psyche and corporeality. There is no "extra thing" behind this conjugation, meaning human beings are effectively determined by their psychical substance. This creates a fundamental tension with the Christian need for moral agency and free will.
- **The Malleus Maleficarum illustration**: The text's argument that witches cannot truly transform into animals (because changing psyche would destroy the original identity/ousia) perfectly illustrates the Aristotelian constraint on freedom -- there is no self that persists independently of its psychical and corporeal configuration.
- **Nominalism as incomplete liberation**: The nominalists dissolved psychical substance into mere mental categories/names, freeing humans from determination by forms but at the cost of eliminating any universal or general knowledge about nature. This set the stage for Humean skepticism and Kantian transcendental idealism.
- **Bruno's monadology as third path**: Bruno proposed monads as a category of being that is neither matter nor psyche but pure self-determination, pure unity. Each monad is an instantiation of the cosmic soul (God), possessing genuine freedom. This allowed psyche and corporeality to "adhere within" the monad rather than exhaustively constituting identity.
- **Continuity from medieval salvation to techno-capitalism**: The Aristotelian Christian notion of salvation as dematerialization (ridding the world of its formless kora/darkness) is continuous with the techno-scientific project of enframing (Heidegger's Gestell) -- both seek to eliminate indeterminacy, unpredictability, and the "great mother" in favor of total control and pure idealization.
