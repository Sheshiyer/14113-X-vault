# The Divergent Science Iceberg Part 1

## Summary

A broad survey of divergent scientific and philosophical theories organized as an "iceberg" of increasing depth and interconnection. The video covers Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and panpsychism, bioelectricity and Michael Levin's planarian research demonstrating heritable phenotypic changes without genetic alteration, quantum biology and quantum coherence in photosynthesis, Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance theory, ancestral/genetic memory, electric sun theory and the SAFIRE project, electric universe cosmology, the possibility of astrology as synchronization within a self-organizing solar system, stone tape theory reinterpreted through morphic resonance, and Julian Jaynes' bicameral mind hypothesis. Each theory is presented as building upon the previous ones toward a more interrelational and morphogenetic understanding of nature.

## Key Insights

- Integrated Information Theory defines consciousness as a fundamental aspect of information integration in complex systems, making it a conceptual framework rather than a falsifiable empirical hypothesis, akin to defining terms like "rain" or "hail."
- Michael Levin's bioelectricity research demonstrates that two-headed planarians produce two-headed offspring with no DNA alteration, suggesting phenotypic morphology is governed by bioelectric fields rather than genetic sequences. DNA codes for cellular protein "hardware" but not morphological "software."
- Quantum biology reveals that photosynthesis achieves over 99% energy capture efficiency through quantum coherence, with electrons "searching" for correct receptor sites in superposition before collapsing. This should be impossible at biological temperatures, suggesting unknown mechanisms.
- Morphic resonance theory proposes that self-organizing systems shape one another across space and time through formal similarity, constituting a kind of morphogenetic telepathy that shapes physiology, behavior, memory, and even fundamental constants of nature as habits rather than laws.
- Electric Sun theory proposes stars are powered externally by galactic-scale Birkeland currents rather than internally by gravity-driven nuclear fusion, with the SAFIRE project reportedly replicating solar phenomena in laboratory settings.
- The bicameral mind hypothesis suggests that prior to roughly 3,000 years ago, human consciousness lacked introspective self-awareness, with cognition proceeding through auditory hallucinations experienced as voices of gods or ancestors, corresponding closely to Gebser's theory of consciousness structure evolution.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Electromagnetic Morphogenetics**: A throughline connecting bioelectricity, electric universe theory, and morphic resonance suggests that electromagnetic phenomena are the primary organizing principle at all scales from cells to galaxies.
- **Consciousness as Fundamental**: IIT, morphic resonance, and quantum biology all converge on the view that consciousness or experience is not an epiphenomenon but a fundamental aspect of natural processes.
- **Inheritance Beyond DNA**: Lamarckian inheritance, epigenetics, bioelectricity, and morphic resonance all challenge the neo-Darwinian gene-centric paradigm, suggesting that acquired characteristics can be heritable through non-genetic mechanisms.
- **Interconnectedness**: Astrology, morphic resonance, and the stone tape theory all point toward a universe where things are far more interconnected than mechanistic science admits, through formative causal relationships that transcend spatial and temporal proximity.

## Transcript Excerpt

> if you're familiar with my work here then you'll know that most of my content consists of very deep dives into philosophical scientific or esoteric Concepts this video is going to be a bit different in that we are going to be painting with a slightly broader brush than usual here we are going to be looking at a fairly wide range of ideas which have emerged from aca
