# The Abyss of Subjectivity (EPO 3)

## Summary
The third installment of The Whole Critter's Ever-Present Origin series opens with the striking question of why no congenitally blind person has ever been diagnosed with schizophrenia, connecting vision to the deepest structures of selfhood. Drawing on Gebser's analysis of Petrarch's ascent of Mount Ventoux as the birth of perspectival consciousness, and Bateson's double-bind theory of schizogenesis, the video explores how subjectivity emerges through the interplay of boundaries, trust, vision, and the painful process of ego-membrane formation.

## Key Insights
- **Congenital blindness and immunity to schizophrenia**: The video opens with the documented fact that no congenitally blind person has ever been diagnosed with schizophrenia, suggesting a deep connection between visual perception and the formation (or dissolution) of the ego boundary between interiority and exteriority.
- **Petrarch's ascent as the birth of perspectival consciousness**: Gebser identifies Petrarch's 1336 letter about climbing Mount Ventoux as a pivotal moment in the emergence of perspectival consciousness -- the first time a human being experienced the world as a landscape viewed from an external vantage point. This seemingly simple act signaled the death of an entire cosmos.
- **Schizogenesis and double-bind**: Bateson's theory that schizophrenia originates from a double-bind situation between infant and caregiver reveals the most fundamental dynamics of ego formation. The human ego is a semi-permeable membrane shaped by relationships of trust and fear, and trauma is the breakdown of the boundaries that delineate self from world.
- **Ego as nested matryoshka dolls**: The human psyche creates successive shells of increasing densification around a formless, vulnerable core. The inner child at the center feels most deeply but is most vulnerable; outer ego-complexes are more numb but serve as protective buffers against existential horror.

## Transcript Excerpt
> I want to begin this discussion by asking a question why is it that there has never been even a single documented case of a congenitally blind person being diagnosed with schizophrenia why is it that people who have never gazed upon the world seem to be immune to this disease of the Mind in which the boundaries of internality and externality become so horrifyingly warped...
