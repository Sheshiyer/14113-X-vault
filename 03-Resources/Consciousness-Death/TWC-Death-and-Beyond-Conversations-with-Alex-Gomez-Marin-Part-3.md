# Death and Beyond; Conversations with Alex Gomez Marin Part 3

## Summary

The third conversation between Killian and Alex Gomez-Marin centers on death, identity, and what may persist beyond bodily death. They explore Whitehead's evolving conception of immortality (from passive objectification to active regeneration through hybrid prehension), the ontological inertia of selfhood, and the transhumanist denial of death exemplified by Kurzweil. The dialogue ventures into quantum mechanics and parapsychology, with Gomez-Marin sharing firsthand experiences with remote viewing and retrocausal experiments using random event generators, suggesting that the boundary between potential and actual may be more fluid than Whitehead supposed.

## Key Insights

1. **Active vs. passive immortality in Whitehead**: Early Whitehead sees the past as immortalized through objectification (carved in stone); late Whitehead introduces a feedback loop through God's consequent nature where the past is actively regenerated into the present via hybrid prehension -- corresponding to Sheldrake's morphic resonance and Bergson's recollection.

2. **Selfhood as ontological inertia**: The ego's fundamental drive is self-preservation and repetition, akin to kinetic inertia in physics. Heidegger's reading of Nietzsche's Will to Power as self-securing connects this to Descartes' inward turn, where the human subject becomes the hypokeion (ultimate foundation).

3. **Kurzweil and transhumanism as unconscious Christianity**: The Singularity movement recapitulates the alchemical project of spiritualizing the body, but inverted -- attempting to endow technology with spiritual properties because nature is perceived as blind and suboptimal. "Transhumanism is like a joke explained."

4. **Retrocausal remote viewing experiments**: Gomez-Marin describes firsthand experiments where subjects draw images corresponding to targets selected randomly after the drawing, raising questions about whether Whitehead's binary of potential/actual should instead be a gradient correlated with intensity of consciousness.

5. **Death anxiety as contracted selfhood**: Modern death-phobia stems not merely from materialism but from the contraction of self-identification into a dimensionless point of subjectivity -- a "little black hole" we cannot escape. Philosophy's goal (per Plato) may be to make the boundaries of self more malleable.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Multiple bodies and layers of soul**: Sanskrit traditions of etheric/astral bodies that persist differentially after death; Norse/Germanic view of particular soul-layers that must be spiritually purified to reincarnate.
- **Backstage/frontstage metaphor**: The actualized measurable world as the stage; quantum potentiality and the imaginal realm as the backstage from which entities emerge and seem impossible from the stage perspective.
- **Griffin's panexperientialist case for survival**: David Ray Griffin's final book arguing that Whiteheadian panexperientialism raises the prior probability of survival after death from zero to 0.5, then empirical evidence raises it further.
- **Consciousness as inextinguishable light**: Bergson/buron's phenomenological argument that nothingness requires something plus the operation of negating it, therefore consciousness cannot emerge from nothing nor end in nothing.

## Transcript Excerpt

> all right and we are live yet again Alex and so I guess we're going to pick up on camera where we left off off camera or off recording last time we we started talking about Daniel denit and uh death and what the experience of of death is like within the context of this idea of of the radical otherness radical Beyond you know liminality and that kind of thing and uh so um what I was thinking then is is I kind of wanted to look at this in terms of identity right because the way that death really is...
