Don't take our word for it. Here's what they have to say about Niche Tools.
Niche Web Tools is the most effective way to find a profitable niche in boring but most importantly, under-tapped niches. You just have to transpose it in your specific domain, et voilà !

Found the idea to build water intake calculator through niche web tools. Pretty surprising to see a bunch of very niche tools that are performing really well.

I've always been a big fan of simple tools to accomplish quick tasks. These can be a huge help to get through the day-to-day tasks that we commonly come across and the most simple tool can have big results. Freeing up additional time even for the most simplest of tasks is something I'm always trying to do and this resource has helped give me tools that I can use, but also has given me inspiration to build more of my tools. Definitely worth it and with the continued updates it will only increase the value you're able to get from it over time.
