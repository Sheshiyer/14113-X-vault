# Neon Genesis; Allure of Abyssal Oneness

## Summary

A deep archetypal and Jungian analysis of Neon Genesis Evangelion, mapping the series' characters, symbols, and narrative onto psychological and metaphysical frameworks. The video traces Shinji Ikari's fractured individuation through the Oedipal complex, the bifurcated anima (Rei as lunar/neptunian maternal desire; Asuka as solar/martian masculine ideal), and the AT Field as a literal manifestation of plutonic separation anxiety. It presents an alternative reading of the Evangelion mythos, arguing that the extraterrestrial Angels were actually trying to save humanity from SEELE's instrumentality project rather than destroy it, and that Shinji's final choice to embrace separation over Oneness affirms the purposiveness of individuality.

## Key Insights

1. **Bifurcated anima as fractured soul**: Shinji's unusual dual-anima (Rei and Asuka) reflects his soul cleaved in half by trauma. Rei represents lunar/neptunian desire for maternal return; Asuka represents solar/martian qualities Shinji cannot embody, creating both humiliation and sexual tension.

2. **AT Field as plutonic separation**: The Absolute Terror Field is a quasi-physical manifestation of the metaphysical barrier separating individual souls from cosmic Oneness. Synchronization rate correlates with connection to the collective unconscious; greater connection makes the self/world barrier more malleable.

3. **Instrumentality as anti-theosis**: SEELE's Human Instrumentality Project dissolves individual freedom, transforming humanity into mechanical beings lacking autonomy. This subverts the cosmic destiny of humanity as the only angelic beings capable of incarnating God's freedom within individual subjectivity.

4. **Alternative mythos interpretation**: The Angels were not attacking humanity but attempting to free Lilith and prevent SEELE's instrumentality. The "official" narrative within the show is fabricated by unreliable narrators (NERV/SEELE).

5. **Astro-chromagram mapping**: Characters systematically mapped onto planetary archetypes -- Gendo (Saturn/Jupiter), Misato (Venus/Uranus), Evas (Pluto), Rei (Moon/Mercury/Neptune), Asuka (Sun/Mars/Pluto) -- demonstrating the show's deep archetypal coherence.

## Themes & Patterns

- **Birth/separation as cosmic pattern**: The birth of consciousness begins with division; the death of Oneness is the birth of individuality. This plays out at personal, species, and cosmic scales.
- **Beauty requires separation**: Within primordial Oneness there can be no beauty; love requires symbiosis of irreducibly different things. Shinji's final realization that "tranquil static anesthesia" is not love.
- **Gnostic motif reframed**: The life-disavowal tendency is not uniquely Gnostic but pervades virtually all spiritual traditions to varying degrees; Evangelion's genius is dramatizing the tension without simplistically resolving it.
- **Pleroma and everepresent origin**: The undifferentiated primordial consciousness (Gnostic pleroma, Daoist wuji, Gebser's everpresent origin) underlies the AT Field's metaphysics.

## Transcript Excerpt

> the birth of Consciousness always necessarily begins with division with a rupturing a part of the primordial embryonic Oneness within which there is not yet any distinction between the objective interiority of the child and the body of the mother the death of Oneness is the birth of boundaries and the birth of individuality this is a pattern which we see encapsulated and exemplified within the process of biological birth and which we see elaborated unfolded...
