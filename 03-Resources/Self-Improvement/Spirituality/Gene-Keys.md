TO THE EDGE OF THE WORDLESS
The books of Richard Rudd are as inspiring as they are insightful, ranging from the pragmatic to the poetic. Companions on your journey, some offer guidance, some share Richard’s own profound and mystical experiences, and some illuminate a deeper spiritual truth accessible to us all.
