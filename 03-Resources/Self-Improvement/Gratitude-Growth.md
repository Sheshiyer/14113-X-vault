Jira Epic, Story or Task: What to Use and When
Minimum detectable effect (MDE) is pretty simple on the surface, but it’s also one of the most confusing and misunderstood terms in online A/B testing. The most common misunderstanding is that the MDE is the smallest lift in an A/B test that will be statistically significant. People with a pretty good understanding of these things might think, “How is that a misunderstanding? That’s what MDE is!” Well, it’s pretty close, but even those people know in the back of their minds that statistical power also factors into MDE. Assuming 80% power, we would have to extend that definition to be “the smallest lift that will be stat sig 80% of the time”. This is where the common understanding starts to fall apart.
