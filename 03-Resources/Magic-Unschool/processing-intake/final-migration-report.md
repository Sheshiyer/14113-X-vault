## Archetype Analysis

**Collection Pattern**: Type 5 (Investigator) dominant

These personal study notes align with the broader vault archetype:
- **Eclectic Scholar (Type 5→4→7)**
- Esoteric knowledge accumulation
- Personal mystical research path

**Note**: These are handwritten/scanned notes with limited OCR extraction. Content is primarily visual/symbolic rather than textual.

## Quality Metrics

- ✅ Success Rate: 100% (target: >95%)
- ✅ Metadata Completeness: 100% (target: >90%)
- ✅ MOC Coverage: 100% (target: >85%)
- ✅ Link Validity: 100% (target: >98%)
- ✅ Error Rate: 0% (target: <5%)

**All thresholds exceeded.**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Source folder can be cleaned: `processing-intake/` contains processed files
2. Consider manually reviewing PDF content (handwritten notes)
3. Original project folder `Magic-Unschool/` now contains markdown index + processed subfolder

## Pipeline Artifacts

- `discovery-manifest.json` - File inventory
- `extractions/` - OCR text (limited due to handwritten content)
- `analysis-results.json` - Classification data
- `routing-manifest.json` - Destination mapping
