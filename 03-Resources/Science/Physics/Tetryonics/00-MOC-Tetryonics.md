# 00-MOC-Tetryonics: The Equilateral Universe

> "Mathematics is the language of Physics, and Geometry is its grammar." — Abraham (2008)

## 🌌 Overview
**Tetryonics** is a fundamental re-interpretation of quantum mechanics and general relativity through the lens of **Equilateral Geometry**. It reveals a hidden topology where all mass, energy, and matter are constructed from equilateral Planck quanta, rather than the circular or squared geometries assumed by the Standard Model.

## 📐 The Tatvas (Universal Truths)
- **Equilateral Topology:** The foundational geometry of the universe is the equilateral triangle (2D) and the tetrahedron (3D).
- **Geometry as Grammar:** Physical laws are not just mathematical formulas; they are geometric constraints.
- **Energy is Area:** $E = mc^2$ and $E = hv$ describe the equilateral area of energy momenta.
- **Charge as Flux:** Positive charge is clockwise inductive energy flux; Negative charge is counter-clockwise flux.
- **Mass as Scalar:** Mass is a scalar measurement of quantized equilateral energy per unit of time.
- **No Aether:** Space is an empty topology; light propagates through the geometric structure of fields without needing a medium.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
- **Rectification of the Square:** "Squared" values in physics (e.g., $v^2$, $c^2$) must be visualized as equilateral triangles to reveal the true mechanics of force interactions.
- **Integer Basis:** All quantum levels are discrete integers, reflecting the "untouched" whole units of geometry.
- **Visual Intuition:** Geometric visualization is superior to mathematical abstraction for understanding Electrodynamics, Gravitation, and Chemistry.
