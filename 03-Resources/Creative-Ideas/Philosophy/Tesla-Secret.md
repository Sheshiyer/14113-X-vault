good morning everyone first and foremost
we do have free energy stop paying your
energy bill no more no more bills to pay
we have free energy we invented the per
pure motion machine that would
generate electricity forever one thing
take a look at this video first putting
out more when I'm putting in so the the
trick is to get that smaller I just had
that I just I want to know if I could
make you know electricity with it and it
does work perfectly it works if I would
have high RPM to be able to spin that
really high I would probably get about
5,000
volts 5,000 volt and it will be a high
frequency volt and I have three legs
with making voltage so I have ch this is
another video of free energy check this
out
keep
Deary and we have another one this one
take a
look
this is actually the best one this is
the the last one Rises
3267 Ines per
Revolution we'll be converting that into
foot pound the foot pounds into
horsepower and the horsepower into the
walks which will be the motor's output
power so how was the how was it pretty
cool right sounds so easy to make
everybody made fre energy on YouTube
everybody's over producing energy so you
have like a small input and you have
like a greater
output so after watching all these
videos I decid to make one my own and
it's very very simple it does not
require any coils bini generators so
many magnets and uh such a big motor
I've got something even simpler than
that I've got my 3.7 volts lithium
batteries this is a very common battery
you find everywhere including your
laptop battery this is what Tesla cars
uses to power their their their cars so
it's a very common at 3.7 volts where
actually this guy here it's a small
1.5 volt motor this one it's 120 volts
motor I don't know if you can see
there so for instance if you apply some
energy to this motor it will start spin
it will start spinning so to the other
side if you make a spin it will produce
an electricity so this is not even
brushless it's a normal motor this got
so much friction to be honest with you
including the gearing however my
machine it pulls about
300% electricity I know you're skeptical
but I'm going to prove it and there is
no video editing let me show it to you
we have battery we have a
switch and our generator I've got
my voltage
meter or multimeter whatever you want to
call it and let's go plug
it I would like to remember that to
recall there are no tricks there are no
extra battery also because for the
amount of energy I'm going to pull out
this device it will be quite impossible
to hide anything so let's go ahead and
test
it so that's what everybody does online
and that's what I'm going to do going to
test the device check this
out I've got got my meter right
here on DC volt right
there I got 3.7 volt input let's see how
much we got out of
it we got 44 43 volts out of this guys
BR no
tricks there are no
tricks no tricks I'm pulling 46 volts
out 42 40 it's kind of yeah out of 3.7
volt battery check this out it's spining
quite
fast okay it's minus because I have to
reverse
it but that's what we getting here
okay let's stop it for a
second let's try one more time and I'm
going to
show you that there are no tricks okay
this is our
device input 3.7 volt lithium batteries
output 45 volts 300 or more than 300%
efficiency this is not perpetual motion
this is over Unity this is over
Unity I would like to remember that if
there is any tree hidden battery there
is no way you can attach a 45 volt
battery in here so it must be a very
quite big battery to be 45 Vols let's
try one more
time actually 48
47 this is my over Unity
machine
look at that
one so now turn on for a
second now if you still don't believe me
all
right I'm going to attach a load over
here okay it's an open circle someone
says 45 volts it will drop sure I'm
going to attach a load I'm not going to
attach a simple LED light or whatever
I'm not going to attach two LEDs I'm not
going to attach three LEDs I'm going to
attach what like a four LEDs and notice
that they're all in series not even in
parallel so that three volts out of
these guys they need to multiply by four
it's LED common light 2.5 to 3 volts so
multiply by
four so at least I'm pulling 12 volts
out of it for sure with this with this
system check this is out I'm going to
prove it we have free
energy you don't believe me too bad for
you all right we've got our LEDs here
turn it on check this
out and they're pretty bright
too I'm pulling at least 12 volts out of
this guy out of
3.7 volt battery
there are no tricks guys there are not
it's not video editing I don't know how
to video edit there are no
tricks and they're pretty bright
too
so now if you know what is my Channel
about you realize this is a hawx this is
pure plan bull crap
this stuff it doesn't work
neither like those guys they try to
prove we have free energy because you
can patent this you can patent whatever
you want you can patent as a free energy
generator but you can patent it so
someone will try to replicate it has to
pay I got my path and paning on it uh
you guys can't believe in every YouTube
video you watch and uh I'm not trying to
prove that we eventually will have end
up having free energy in the future but
this kind of stuff it will never work
it's been testing and retesting as many
times as you want I understand you guys
don't have any knowledge in uh you know
electronic engineering uh you don't have
to be Electronic Engineer to know the
basic of electronics and physics it
takes really like a simple homs law to
realize that this is this is a
fake now you wonder why you have more
vault voltage out of
it out of your 3.7 volt
battery it's pretty simple you don't
measure energy in terms of voltage you
don't measure energy in terms of ampere
or current you measure in this case in
an electrical Circle you measure in
terms of Watts so the overall energy
output you
need which means that it is true that
I'm pulling 45 volts out of a 3.7 volt
battery but we need to consider this
battery is also
2.2
amps so that pulls up it
wattage is the Vault multiply by the
Ampere so this battery over here it's
about 10 watts of energy so you're
scking about 10 watts of energy out of
this battery in order to balance the
circuit okay you end up having 40 volts
but you end up with a very very very
little tiny amount of
amps in the order of 0.0 z01 10 whatever
you want in order to balance the 10
watts you still have 10 watts out of
this you just have more vaults but lower
amps there is no way in physics you can
raise Vault and amps at the same time
one it can go up and the other one goes
down one it goes down the other one it
goes up
and I tell you more if I'm pulling 10
watts out of this system I'm going to
end up having perpetual motion if I if
my input is 10 watts and I receive 10
watts that's still perpetual motion it
means that I can self feed my machine
and this will never work we can even try
there we go self-feeding the Machine by
pulling one of these things out this
machine it will never work check this
out it doesn't work it doesn't even
start and you're like what a second you
have like 40 Vols you know pull out of
that machine how come we cannot feed a
1.5 volt motor because we have almost
zero
amps faradise says that we actually we
can have a voltage without even current
so you can have all the voltage you want
you can have 10,000 volts 20,000 volts
with zero current
zero
so Zero
Energy zero and no perpetual motion
these guys are proving they actually not
only perpetual motion they have over
unity and I'm
like uh oh my goodness well I've been to
school I went to school I'm engineer but
for all those people that actually don't
know the basic of of engineering they
should definitely take a class or at
least be a little bit skeptical
uh I would like to see these people
actually stop paying really their energy
bill than I believe them
this is my over Unity generator you
don't need so many coils you don't need
so many magnets because even in magnets
there is some friction even if that
friction is
0.00000000 1% you still have some
friction it's not pretal motion but wa a
second but that one it's a brushless
motor the other guy made sure we still
have gravity they push the axle
downwards we still have friction by heat
even if they're not touching have you
tried to to get two strong man
and pulling a side of each other they
will generate heat yes a coil generates
heat that's a loss it can be
0.00000000 1% it's not perpetual motion
guess what these guys are trying to
prove that they have over Unity not just
perpetual motion even over Unity uh
guess what I proved I've got my over
unit over here 3.7 45 volts to the other
side guess what it's definitely less
than 10 watts my
output by putting some lights just like
these guys it doesn't mean anything okay
I'm using 12
volts but I'm using like bar
z.2
milliamps barely so that makes up not
even for six watts of
energy there is no way I can make for 10
watts of energy of this battery this
batter is very energy dense
battery I can even pull 5,000 volts out
of it my current will be even
lower all right if you have any
questions if you think that I'm this
system is not reliable and go proof
please email me I'm going to make
another one and uh if you have any
request of debang any video on YouTube
uh please subscribe and uh just you know
send me let me know and I will make a
new video to the bank any video you want
within 44 hours or 48 hours thank you
for watching and please subscribe
