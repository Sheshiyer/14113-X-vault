The Master Key is captured in Hill's profound quote:
"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve."
- Napoleon Hill
Hill caught his first glimpse of the concept while meeting with Andrew Carnegie in 1908.
This talk changed his life forever, allowing him to help millions.

Carnegie introduced Hill to a power...
"A power which is greater than poverty, greater than the lack of education and greater than all your fears and superstitions combined..."
"It is the power to take possession of your own mind and direct it to whatever ends you may desire."
"This profound power is the gift of the creator, and it must have been considered the greatest of all of his gifts to man because it is the only thing man has complete and unchallengeable right of control and direction."
- Andrew Carnegie
"When you speak of your poverty and lack of education, you are simply directing your mind power to attract these undesirable circumstances because it is true, whatever your mind feeds upon, your mind attracts to you."
- Andrew Carnegie

Carnegie: Everyone has at birth the equivalent of 2 sealed envelopes...
1. "The riches you may enjoy if you take possession of your own mind and direct it to ends of your own choice."
2. "The penalties you must pay if you neglect to take possession of your mind and direct it."
In the envelope labelled "Riches" is this list of blessings:
1. Sound Health.
2. Peace of Mind.
3. A labour of love of your own choice.
4. Freedom from fear and worry.
5. A positive mental attitude.
6. Material riches of your own choice and quantity.
In the envelope labelled "Penalties" is this list of prices:
1. Ill Health.
2. Fear and Worry.
3. Indecision and Doubt.
4. Frustration and Discouragement throughout life.
5. Poverty and Want.
6. A whole flock of evils: Envy, jealousy, fear, greed, anger, hatred and superstition.
These letters clearly show the 2 potential walks of life for people to experience today.
Currently, there's a massive divide, but we can improve this by sharing Hill's message to spread awareness for the betterment of humanity.
After the controversial and debated talk in 1908, Hill became one of the most powerful men in the world.
He dedicated the remainder of his life to helping millions open the envelope labelled riches...

2. Then, where you stand now, begin giving it all.
3. Memorise your desire and intention to give at least a dozen times daily. (Always express gratitude and pray for more wisdom.)
"There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it."
