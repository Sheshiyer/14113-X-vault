here's up guys g'day in thug life this
is my revised Ableton Live course really
we're going to be going over basically
everything you need to know to get
started making tunes in Ableton and I've
done this before it was more of a
beginner type thing
couple months ago and wasn't you know
too good the quality is kind of not
where I want to be so decide to redo it
I decided to cover basically everything
this time except max for live we're
going to be going over session
arrangement plugins everything I have
notes in front of me I've been kind of
formulating this for a little while
waiting for the right time to do it the
last one I kind of had a lower energy
level and it wasn't too good but on this
one we are we are golden
we have full on full screen tape II so I
suggest you watch this in full screen
and click that HD option
hopefully you share this and you give me
hugs and yeah basically this is the
intro is going to be a lot of videos
some long some short I'm going to be
covering everything again I have my
notes and I have it set up so I have it
set up so like this compatible for
everyone coming from every direction if
you're absolutely new and you're curious
or if you come from
FL Studio or you know another for an
older version of live you come from a
tractor a tractor a tracker a fear from
the 80s yeah basically that's it so
anyway um yeah that's kind of disaster
but we're going to get through this
together and yeah hope you enjoy and

good one like comment subscribe share
