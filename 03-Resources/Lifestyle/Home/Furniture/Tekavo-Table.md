A good quality product. Highly recommended.

Model: X- Large -150 CMVerified Purchase
All the materials seems to be of good quality. Assembly is easy, though the instructions could be better. Took about an hour to assemble and once assembled the table is very sturdy. Ample space for all the PC components. Nicely thought after design.

Good table , I have gaming PC with Full tower CPU cabinet and 27inch monitor and the table is big enough for my setup. Table wood ply is heavy is it requires two people to assemble.

Sturdy Table with Great Design, But Keyboard Tray Falls Short
Reviewed in India on 1 August 2024
Model: Medium -120 CMVerified Purchase
This table is sturdy with a nice design and a useful monitor stand. It served my purpose well. However, the keyboard tray is too short and the diagonal support stripes were not long enough. Customer support has been unresponsive, forcing me to improvise by drilling holes and fitting the stripes horizontally.

I purchased this brand PC table. Overall the product looks good abd great value for money. Product delivered to me had little defect (probably during transport). But it has been replaced immediately by the company. I greatly appreciate the support team of TEKAVO company for rectifying my issue by providing suitable replacement.

Amazing Product😍
Reviewed in India on 3 June 2024
Model: Large -140 CMVerified Purchase
Absolutely worth it❤️ if you are looking for a stylish workstation/wfh setup. It has plenty of space on it to keep your items, monitor raiser is very helpful for good viewing angle. The two shelfs on the left is also very useful. Lastly the build and wood quality is really good and it feels sturdy and premium.
You can go for it blindly if you have requirement of a work table or computer table. The packaging was good too. Its a 5/5 from me🤩

Fantastic table, works wonders. You get exactly what you see in the image and the setup is quite easy. The metal used is heavy duty. Go for this table you won't regret it
