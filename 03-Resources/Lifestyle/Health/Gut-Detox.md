Trying to do a gut detox without using binders is one of the worst ideas.
You can end up doing more harm than good.
Here’s why:
When going through a detox, harmful substances are mobilized in the gut.
Pathogens release endotoxins, biofilm waste products are broken up, heavy metals are released from tissues, etc.
These substances can be reabsorbed into the bloodstream.
If toxins are constantly circulating in the body, it can lead to
- Kidney & liver damage
- Dysbiosis
- Intestinal permeability
- Chronic inflammation
- Accumulation of toxins (like metals) in  the brain
- Chronic disease like cancer
Enter binders.
These attach to toxins, heavy metals, microbial byproducts and other unwanted substances in the body helping eliminate them through the GI tract.
They’re even used for poisonings and drug overdoses as well.
Binders help reduce liver and kidney load, prevent absorption of harmful substances into the bloodstream and help reduce inflammation and other downstream effects caused by circulating toxins.
They are accessible, affordable & effective detoxing tools.
There are many different types of binders made of things like minerals and plants.
Each is unique.
Strength, what they can bind to, interactions and several other factors are important to consider when deciding on a binder to use.
Here are some that I like & use most.
ZEOLITE
This is composed mainly of silicon, aluminum & oxygen.
It has a highly porous structure with a large surface area enhancing its binding capabilities.
It’s found naturally in volcanic rocks and sedimentary formations.
Zeolite has a negative charge making it a good option for heavy metals.
It’s capable of binding to:
- Heavy metals like lead & mercury
- Radioactive Isotopes
- Bacteria
- Mycotoxins
- Environmental toxins like pesticides
A study interestingly found that zeolite reduced intestinal permeability over 12 weeks.
This was shown through a 30% reduction in zonulin.
This was likely due to its binding capability with harmful substances that contribute to permeability like toxins.

PECTIN
Pectin is a negatively charged polysaccharide in the cell walls of plants, particularly fruits.
Unmodified is derived directly from sources like apples and citrus fruits.
Modified is altered pectin through processes like pH modification and thermal treatment.
Pectin is capable of binding to:
- Heavy metals like lead and cadmium
- Radioactive Isotopes
- Bacteria & their endotoxins
- Metabolic waste
- Mycotoxins
- Environmental toxins like pesticides and PCBs
Pectin was also used to safely remove chernobyl radioactivity from kids.
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that it helped provide a significant reduction in radioactive isotopes by 62%.

When it comes to differences between modified and unmodified, the binding capacity of unmodified is generally lower.
Modified pectin is a simpler structure with increased surface area that boosts its binding capabilities.
Modified is also smaller & more absorbable, allowing it to enter not only the gut but also the bloodstream.
Whereas unmodified stays in the gut.
Modified pectin’s increased surface area allows it to bind to harmful substances but in the gut and throughout the bloodstream.
ACTIVATED CHARCOAL
Charcoal is probably the most well-known binder.
It is a negatively charged black powder made from things like coconut shells, wood or peat.
These are heated in oxygen-free environments, which increases surface area and makes it porous aka great for binding.
Activated charcoal is capable of binding to:
- Endotoxins
- Bacteria
- Xenoestrogens
- Pesticides
- Heavy metals
- Drugs & poisons
- Gasses
- Bile acids & cholesterol
Charcoal is made up of fine particles, but they’re still too big to be absorbed through the walls of the gut into the bloodstream.
Making it great for detoxing in the GI tract specifically.
Activated charcoal is one of the most powerful binders.
It is capable of binding to not only harmful substances but also beneficial ones like nutrients.
I always make sure to space it out 2-3 hours away from meals or nutrient supplements.
CHLORELLA
This is an algae that grows naturally in ponds.
It is dried out and turned into a powder for use in supplements often because of its binding capabilities and negative charge.
Chlorella is capable of binding to heavy metals like mercury, lead or arsenic.
It can also bind to environmental toxins like dioxins or PCBs.
It is most known for its heavy metal binding capacity, which is moderate compared to others.
While chlorella is less powerful than options like charcoal, it's still helpful.
I prefer using it in combination with others rather than standalone.
It does also provide additional nutritional benefits due to its nutrient-rich profile with vitamins and antioxidants.
BENTONITE CLAY
This is formed from the weathering of volcanic ash in the presence of water.
It carries a negative charge and is composed of many substances including minerals like silica, calcium and magnesium.
When bentonite clay is ingested, it swells up and becomes porous.
This increases the surface area and absorption capabilities of it.
It binds to substances via ionic exchange and absorption, which traps them in its structure helping pull them from the body.
Bentonite clay is capable of binding to:
- Environmental toxins
- Mycotoxins
- Certain bacteria, viruses & parasites
- Heavy metals like mercury, cadmium and aluminum
Bentonite clay’s binding strength is moderate, making it effective, but not as much as something like activated charcoal.
It is selective in terms of positively charged substances and is not known to bind to beneficial substances the same as charcoal.
Quality is a concern with bentonite clay.
Many options are not good and bentonite is known to be prone to contaminants like arsenic.

Like pectins, many dietary fibers that can help with detoxing.
I always include fiber in the diet when going through these processes from foods like okra, carrots, mushrooms & lower glycemic fruits.
Following a diet like carnivore is generally not the best idea for this imo.
Successfully detoxing from high levels of harmful substances like these without using binders is difficult.
These are some of the binder that I think work best.
But again, it’s important to match up the strengths of the binder with what is being addressed.
If you want more info on my detoxing protocols that dozens of my clients successfully used, I'm hosting a webinar on Friday.
There will be a Q&A to discuss your situation & best options.
There are 9 spaces left - available till 12 EST tomorrow.
DM me "detox" if interested.
