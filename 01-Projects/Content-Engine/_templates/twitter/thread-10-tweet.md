"Most people think consciousness is a journey. It's not."

{{Your experience. The "I've been there" credibility.}}

## Tweet 3 — The Problem (Universal)
{{Expand to reader's situation. "You've noticed..."}}

## Tweet 4 — The Reframe (Technical)
{{The metaphor shift. OS, debugging, runtime, code.}}

## Tweet 5 — The Philosophy (Deep)
{{The philosophical foundation. Kha-Ba-La, authorship, witness.}}

## Tweet 6 — The Build (What You Made)
{{Show, don't tell. Selemene, Noesis TUI, specific numbers.}}

## Tweet 7 — The Bridge (Reader Connection)
{{"If you're..." — direct address to Seeker Simon.}}

## Tweet 8 — The Contrast (Before/After)
{{Old way vs new way. Dependency vs authorship.}}
