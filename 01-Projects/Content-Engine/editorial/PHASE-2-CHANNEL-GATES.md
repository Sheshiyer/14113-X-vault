# Phase 2 Channel Expansion Gates
**Date:** 2026-02-24  
**Scope:** Unlock reposting to Instagram, Facebook, and Threads only after Phase 1 signal quality is stable.

---

## Objective
Scale reach **without collapsing signal-to-noise ratio**.

Phase 1 channels stay primary:
- X (Twitter)
- Reddit
- LinkedIn

Phase 2 channels are repost/distribution only:
- Instagram
- Facebook
- Threads

Weekly scoring template:
- `editorial/performance-reports/PHASE1-SNR-SCORECARD-TEMPLATE.md`

## Gate Checklist (All required)

### 1) Cadence Stability Gate (4-week window)
- [ ] Minimum **12 Phase 1 posts** published (combined across X, Reddit, LinkedIn)
- [ ] No week with fewer than **3 published posts**
- [ ] No more than **1 missed planned slot** per week

### 2) Quality / Signal Gate
- [ ] At least **70%** of Phase 1 posts rated **SNR ≥ 4/5** in weekly review
- [ ] At least **6 posts** with meaningful discussion (comments/replies showing comprehension, not generic praise)
- [ ] Intro + runway content passes non-pitch clarity check

### 3) System Reliability Gate
- [ ] Consistency audit run after each major draft cycle
- [ ] No unresolved critical depth-gate failures in active launch content
- [ ] Calendar is current for next 14 days

### 4) Repurpose Readiness Gate
- [ ] Repost backlog prepared: minimum **8 assets** pre-mapped for phase 2
- [ ] Each repost asset has platform adaptation notes (format + tone + CTA)
- [ ] Publishing owner/time block assigned for phase 2 operations

## Phase 2 Rollout Sequence (when gates pass)

1. Week 1: Start with **Threads** reposts only (2/week)
2. Week 2: Add **Instagram** reposts (2/week)
3. Week 3: Add **Facebook** reposts (1–2/week)
4. Keep Phase 1 channels as source-of-truth; phase 2 channels remain adaptation layer

---

## Stop Conditions (Auto-pause Phase 2)
- Two consecutive weeks of SNR < 4/5
- Cadence miss in Phase 1 source channels
- Quality drop detected in comments/replies relevance

If triggered: pause phase 2 reposting for one week, repair source-layer quality, then resume.
