# PARA → Brand Content Execution Plan
## Tryambakam Noesis Content Engine
**Prepared:** 2026-02-24 02:33 IST  
**Primary Goal:** Convert high-signal topics across PARA into consistent, brand-aligned social publishing outputs for Tryambakam Noesis.

---

## 1) Goal Context (Ground Truth)

### Source of truth (brand)
- `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/01-Projects/tryambakam-noesis/brand-docs-final`
- Use `brand-config.yaml` for voice, archetype, audience, and positioning constraints.

### Transformation layer (content operations)
- `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/01-Projects/Content-Engine`
- Folder lifecycle already established: `_inbox` → `_processing` → `_approved` → `_published`.

### Current queue snapshot
- `_processing` has active drafts:
  - `thread-the-runtime.md`
  - `16-engines-one-purpose-thread.md`
  - `introduction-to-tryambakam-noesis-article.md`
  - `ritual-demo-2026-02-17.md`
  - `github-readme-rewrite-prompt.md`

---

## 2) Operating Principle

**Vault is knowledge source. Content Engine is adaptation layer. Platforms are distribution layer.**

PARA mining should prioritize:
1. **Projects** (timely build logs, launches, shipping updates)
2. **Areas** (ongoing practice systems: rituals, operating principles)
3. **Resources** (evergreen frameworks: Kha-Ba-La, 16 engines, self-authorship)
4. **Archives** (resurfacing high-performing historical ideas)

---

## 3) Skill Stack Mapping (Tailored)

### A. Intake + mining
- `discovery-skill` → locate candidate source notes across PARA buckets.
- `extraction-skill` → extract text from PDFs/EPUBs for repurposing.
- `transcript-processor-skill` → convert chats/transcripts into structured note inputs.

### B. Classification + routing
- `analysis-skill` → Enneagram + PARA + domain classification.
- `routing-skill` → map outputs to correct editorial/pillar destination paths.
- `pattern-synthesizer-skill` (optional weekly) → detect recurring themes worth campaigns.

### C. Content production
- `content-generator-skill` → generate platform-native outputs (X/Threads/LinkedIn/Substack).
- `media-suggest-skill` → recommend image/GIF/video format per draft.
- `visual-prompt-skill` → generate brand-coherent prompts for visuals.

### D. Finalization + memory
- `processing-skill` → standardized markdown, metadata normalization.
- `integration-skill` → update MOC/editorial links and ensure discoverability.
- `orchestrator-skill` → run batch cycles with checkpoints and quality gates.

## 4) PARA-to-Social Production Workflow

1. **Ingest (daily)**
   - Pull 3–7 source items from PARA into `_inbox/` with source links.
2. **Frame (daily)**
   - Move selected items into `_processing/` and assign:
     - pillar
     - platform
     - effort (light/deep)
3. **Generate (daily/bi-daily)**
   - Produce draft variants using `content-generator-skill`.
4. **Media pass (daily)**
   - Run `media-suggest-skill` + `visual-prompt-skill` for each high-priority draft.
5. **Editorial gate (human)**
   - Move approved items to `_approved/ready-to-post/`.
6. **Publish + archive (daily/weekly)**
   - Post manually or via your chosen automation, then move to `_published/YYYY/MM/platform/`.
7. **Retrospective (weekly)**
   - Review performance; feed learnings into future topic selection.

---

## 5) Quality Gates (Must Pass)

- **Brand voice fit:** grounded, direct, respectful-challenging.
- **Positioning fit:** self-consciousness as practiced technology.
- **Audience fit:** Seeker-Simon profile.
- **Technical-mystical balance:** keep within target range (approx. 40/60 to 60/40 by piece type).
- **Format fit:** platform constraints respected.
- **Linkage fit:** each published piece maps back to one source artifact.

---

## 6) 14-Day Activation Plan (Starting 2026-02-24)

### Days 1–3: Stabilize pipeline
- Standardize frontmatter across `_processing` drafts.
- Add missing source references and CTA links.
- Mark top 3 priority posts for immediate publishing.

### Days 4–7: Publish sprint
- Ship 4–6 posts:
  - 2 threads (X)
  - 1 carousel concept (Instagram)
  - 1 long-form or LinkedIn adaptation
- Ensure each has media recommendation + asset status.

### Days 8–10: Expand from PARA
- Mine additional topics from Projects/Resources.
- Generate 8–12 new draft seeds into `_inbox/` and `_processing/`.

### Days 11–14: Systemize
- Create weekly ritual checklist for:
  - intake
  - generation
  - approval
  - publish
  - review
- Lock rolling 30-day calendar in `editorial/content-calendar.md`.

---

## 7) KPI Targets

- **Throughput:** 4–6 published pieces/week
- **Repurposing ratio:** 1 PARA source → 3 platform variants
- **Approval velocity:** draft to approved within 48 hours
- **Pillar balance:** maintain planned distribution across philosophical/system/build/recognition
- **Asset coverage:** 100% of deep posts include at least one visual/motion asset

---

## 8) Immediate Next Actions

1. Promote `thread-the-runtime.md` to approval after final CTA/link check.
2. Convert `16-engines-one-purpose-thread.md` to platform-ready thread + IG carousel brief.
3. Expand `introduction-to-tryambakam-noesis-article.md` into LinkedIn + Substack variants.
4. Add a weekly PARA mining routine in editorial docs.
5. Decide publish automation boundary (manual first, automation after stable cadence).

## 9) Notes

- Broken symlink detected: `editorial/BRAND-KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md` points to a missing target.
- Keep `brand-docs-final/brand-config.yaml` as canonical voice/identity config.
