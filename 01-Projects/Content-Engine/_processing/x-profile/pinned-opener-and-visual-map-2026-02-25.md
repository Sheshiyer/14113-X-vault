## 3-Tweet Pinned Mini-Thread

### T1
Consciousness is a given. Self-consciousness is a practice.
Most systems teach tools.
This work trains authorship.
Body as medium. Breath as interface.

### T2
You can optimize habits, output, and routines—
and still run inherited code under pressure.
That gap is the work:
examining the examiner, not just managing behavior.

### T3
Tryambakam Noesis ⟁
Sixteen engines. One grammar: Kha-Ba-La.
Built for your independence, not your dependency.
Start where your pattern is most alive.
