# The 72-Hour State Trace Protocol (Before You Make Any Big Decision)

## Tweet 1 — Hook
If your state is unstable, your decisions are just stress snapshots.

## Tweet 2 — Setup
Most people try to solve this at the surface layer. That works briefly, then the same loop reappears in a new form.

## Tweet 3 — Problem Pattern
When the underlying runtime stays untouched, better language only makes repetition look intelligent.

## Tweet 4 — Reframe
Delay interpretation. First stabilize and observe the runtime.

## Tweet 5 — Practical Lens
Treat this as a debugging problem:
- identify recurring branch conditions
- name the defense pattern
- measure downstream cost

## Tweet 6 — Protocol
72-hour trace: trigger, body signal, dominant story, action impulse, post-effect.

## Tweet 7 — Close + Question
Try this for 7 days and look at evidence, not mood.
What pattern do you suspect you are repeating right now?
