# The 3-Layer Consciousness Stack: Signal → State → Story

## Tweet 1 — Hook
Most people debug at the story layer. The real bug is usually in state.

## Tweet 2 — Setup
Most people try to solve this at the surface layer. That works briefly, then the same loop reappears in a new form.

## Tweet 3 — Problem Pattern
When the underlying runtime stays untouched, better language only makes repetition look intelligent.

## Tweet 4 — Reframe
Separate raw signal, nervous-system state, and meaning-story before action.

## Tweet 5 — Practical Lens
Treat this as a debugging problem:
- identify recurring branch conditions
- name the defense pattern
- measure downstream cost

## Tweet 6 — Protocol
Use a 3-column log for 7 days: signal/state/story.

## Tweet 7 — Close + Question
Try this for 7 days and look at evidence, not mood.
What pattern do you suspect you are repeating right now?
