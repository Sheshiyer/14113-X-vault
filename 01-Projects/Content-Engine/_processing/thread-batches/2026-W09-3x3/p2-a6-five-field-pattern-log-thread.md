# The 5-Field Pattern Log I Use to Interrupt Loops

## Tweet 1 — Hook
Journaling feelings is useful. Logging patterns is transformative.

## Tweet 2 — Setup
Most people try to solve this at the surface layer. That works briefly, then the same loop reappears in a new form.

## Tweet 3 — Problem Pattern
When the underlying runtime stays untouched, better language only makes repetition look intelligent.

## Tweet 4 — Reframe
Use structured fields so your mind cannot hide in abstraction.

## Tweet 5 — Practical Lens
Treat this as a debugging problem:
- identify recurring branch conditions
- name the defense pattern
- measure downstream cost

## Tweet 6 — Protocol
Field set: trigger, state, defense, action, cost.

## Tweet 7 — Close + Question
Try this for 7 days and look at evidence, not mood.
What pattern do you suspect you are repeating right now?
