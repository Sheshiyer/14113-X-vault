# Trigger → Defense → Cost: The Enneagram Runtime Map

## Tweet 1 — Hook
Every type has a preferred defense. The bill shows up later as life-cost.

## Tweet 2 — Setup
Most people try to solve this at the surface layer. That works briefly, then the same loop reappears in a new form.

## Tweet 3 — Problem Pattern
When the underlying runtime stays untouched, better language only makes repetition look intelligent.

## Tweet 4 — Reframe
Map the pattern chain instead of moralizing your behavior.

## Tweet 5 — Practical Lens
Treat this as a debugging problem:
- identify recurring branch conditions
- name the defense pattern
- measure downstream cost

## Tweet 6 — Protocol
For one week, log trigger/defense/immediate relief/long-term cost.

## Tweet 7 — Close + Question
Try this for 7 days and look at evidence, not mood.
What pattern do you suspect you are repeating right now?
