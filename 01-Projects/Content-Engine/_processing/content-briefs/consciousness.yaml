    **A Consciousness Evolution Manual Disguised as Science Fiction**

    ## Executive Summary


    **Somatic Canticles** is a groundbreaking trilogy that bridges consciousness science,

    The work presents consciousness evolution not as abstract philosophy, but as an
    engineerable system with precise mechanics, measurable states, and practical debugging
    protocols.
