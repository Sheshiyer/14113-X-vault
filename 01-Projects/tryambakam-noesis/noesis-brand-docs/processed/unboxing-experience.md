### Back Side: Copy

```
This object (or blend) is not a tool—
it is a companion for your practice.

Use it as:
• A tactile anchor during inquiry
• A reminder of authorship
• A threshold between thought and
  embodied presence

There is no correct way to engage.
The practice emerges from your attention.

### Landing Page: Layout & Content

#### Header
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS
Ritual Suggestions: [Product Name]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Specs**: 
- Aged Gold line (40mm × 2px)
- Cormorant Garamond for "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS"
- Source Sans 3 for product name

---

#### Section 1: What You Received

```
WHAT YOU RECEIVED

[Product Name] is [brief description: 
e.g., "a grounding blend of mugwort, cedar, 
and vetiver" or "a carved soapstone witness 
agent for practice anchoring"].

This was crafted in [location/context].
The materials were selected for their 
[property: density, scent, texture].

There is no hidden meaning to decode.
The object is what it is.
Your relationship with it emerges through use.
```

**Tone**: Factual, grounded, no mysticism

---

#### Section 2: Ritual Suggestions (Not Instructions)

```
WAYS TO ENGAGE

These are suggestions, not rules.
Your practice is your own.

1. TACTILE ANCHOR
   Place the object/blend within reach 
   during inquiry sessions. When thought 
   spirals, return attention to the material—
   its weight, texture, temperature, scent.

2. THRESHOLD RITUAL
   Before beginning inquiry or decision-making,
   hold or smell the object for 30 seconds.
   Use it as a transition from noise to presence.

3. SOMATIC RESET
   When overwhelmed, close eyes and engage
   the object through touch or scent alone.
   No analysis, no meaning-making—just sensation.

4. WITNESS PRACTICE
   Place object in visual field during writing
   or reflection. It observes without judgment.
   You are witnessed, but not evaluated.

5. QUESTION ANCHOR
   Associate the object with a specific inquiry
   you're holding ("What does sovereignty demand?").
   Engage it only when working with that question.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What emerges from your attention matters
more than adherence to any method.
```

**Tone**: Invitational, non-prescriptive, respects intelligence

---

#### Section 3: Care & Maintenance (if applicable)

```
CARE NOTES

Ritual Blends:
• Store in a cool, dry place
• Cork lid maintains freshness (do not refrigerate)
• Shelf life: 12-24 months
• Do not ingest unless explicitly labeled edible

Symbolic Objects:
• Handle as you would any meaningful tool
• No special care required
• Patina and wear are part of the relationship
• If broken, let it be broken (attachment is not the practice)
```

**Tone**: Practical, non-precious

---

#### Section 4: What This Is Not

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT THIS IS NOT

This is not:
• A magical talisman (no supernatural claims)
• A status symbol (not for display)
• A cure or therapy (not medical)
• A community marker (no tribe signaling)
• The practice itself (it's a companion to practice)

If you find yourself attached to the object,
set it aside. The capacity you're developing
is not dependent on external anchors.

The goal is to outgrow the need for it.
```

**Tone**: Direct, filters magical thinking

---

#### Section 5: Sharing Your Experience (Optional)

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IF YOU WISH TO SHARE

If this object has served your inquiry
and you want to share your experience:

Email: reflections@noesis.example
(Read but not always replied to)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

No review ask. No testimonial request.
Just an open door if genuine reflection arises.
```

**Tone**: Available without pressure

## 3. The Review Ask Strategy

### When NOT to Ask
- ❌ Immediately after delivery
- ❌ In the welcome card
- ❌ In the QR landing page
- ❌ Within first 2 weeks

### When to Ask
✅ **After 30-45 days** (time for genuine practice integration)

### How to Ask

**Email Subject**: "How has [Product Name] served your inquiry?"

**Email Body**:
```
[First Name],

It's been about a month since you received
[Product Name]. I'm curious:

Has it served your inquiry?

If it has—and if you're inclined to share 
publicly—a review would help others understand
what this work actually looks like in practice.

If it hasn't, I'd genuinely appreciate knowing
why. What didn't align? What felt off?

Either way, no obligation.

—[Your Name]
Tryambakam Noesis

[If leaving a review:]
[Link to review platform or email reflections@noesis.example]
```

**Tone**: Genuine curiosity, not transaction  
**No Incentive**: No discount for reviews (corrupts authenticity)  
**Accept Criticism**: Invite negative feedback openly

---

## 4. Product-Specific Landing Pages

### Ritual Blend 01: Grounding
**URL**: `ritual.noesis.example/blend-01-grounding`

**Unique Content**:
```
WHAT YOU RECEIVED

Ritual Blend 01: Grounding contains:
• Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) - for dream clarity
• Cedar (Cedrus atlantica) - for rooted presence
• Vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides) - for descent
• Oak moss (Evernia prunastri) - for connection to slowness

This blend was formulated for those who feel
unmoored—caught between thought and action,
insight and integration. It is not a sedative.
It is a reminder of gravity.

WAYS TO ENGAGE

• Smell before morning practice (threshold ritual)
• Keep jar open during writing/inquiry (presence anchor)
• Hold jar during breath work (somatic connection)
• Scatter small amount on workspace (environmental cue)

Note: Not for ingestion. Scent-based engagement only.
```

---

### Symbolic Object: Witness Agent (Carved Stone)
**URL**: `ritual.noesis.example/object-witness-agent`

**Unique Content**:
```
WHAT YOU RECEIVED

The Witness Agent is a hand-carved piece
of soapstone, shaped to fit comfortably
in the palm. It has no prescribed symbolism.
Its function is presence, not meaning.

This stone was carved by [artisan name/location]
using traditional hand tools. Each one differs
slightly. Yours has its own weight distribution,
texture, and grain pattern.

WAYS TO ENGAGE

• Place in visual field during inquiry (external witness)
• Hold during difficult decisions (somatic grounding)
• Carry in pocket during challenging days (tactile anchor)
• Set on workspace as reminder: "Someone is watching" 
  (the watcher is you)

If dropped and chipped: That's now part of its story.
If lost: The capacity it helped develop remains.
```

## 5. First Week Email Sequence (Optional Follow-Up)

### Email 1: Day 3 After Delivery

**Subject**: "It should have arrived"

**Body**:
```
[First Name],

Your [Product Name] should have arrived by now.

If it hasn't, let me know: [email]

If it has, I'm curious how the opening was.
Did the packaging feel aligned?
Was anything confusing or disappointing?

I'm refining the experience with each batch,
so honest feedback (especially criticism) helps.

No need to reply if everything felt right.

—[Your Name]
```

**Purpose**: Quality check, invitation for feedback (not hand-holding)

---

### Email 2: Day 10 After Delivery

**Subject**: "A question about [Product Name]"

**Body**:
```
[First Name],

You've had [Product Name] for about 10 days.

Not long enough for full integration, but long
enough to notice if something feels off.

One question:
Has it created any shift in how you engage
with your practice—or has it just been
another object on the shelf?

No wrong answer. Genuinely curious.

—[Your Name]

P.S. If you haven't opened it yet, that's
also interesting. What's the hesitation?
```

**Purpose**: Gentle check-in, invites reflection (not review ask)

---

## 6. Month 2: Integration Check (Email)

**Subject**: "Still using it?"

**Body**:
```
[First Name],

It's been about two months since you received
[Product Name].

By now, it's either:
a) Become part of your daily practice
b) Sits unused (honest relationship hasn't formed)
c) You've moved on (outgrown the need)

All three are valid.

If (a): What's the most unexpected way it's
shown up in your practice?

If (b): What prevented the connection?

If (c): That's the design working. The object
served its purpose—training a capacity that
no longer requires external anchoring.

Reply if you're inclined. Or don't.

—[Your Name]

P.S. If you want to share your experience
publicly (review/testimonial), now's the time.
But only if genuine reflection has emerged.

[Link to leave review]
```

**Purpose**: Long-term check-in, subtle review invitation (earned, not pushed)

---

## 7. The "Review Response" Playbook

### If Someone Leaves 5-Star Review

**Response Template**:
```
Thank you, [Name].

I'm glad [Product Name] has served your inquiry.
The fact that it's showing up in your practice—
not just sitting on a shelf—means the relationship
formed as intended.

If it continues to serve, use it.
When it no longer does, set it aside.
The capacity you've developed is yours now.

—[Your Name]
Tryambakam Noesis
```

**Tone**: Gratitude without inflation, reinforces independence

---

### If Someone Leaves 1-Star Review

**Response Template**:
```
[Name], I appreciate you sharing this.

[Acknowledge their specific criticism—don't dismiss]

You're right that [restate their concern]. That's
a genuine miss on my part / a mismatch in expectations.

If you'd like to discuss further, please email me
directly at [email]. I'll make it right if I can.

—[Your Name]
Tryambakam Noesis
```

**Tone**: Ownership, no defensiveness, moves offline

---

### If Someone Leaves Review Like "It's just a rock/jar of herbs"

**Response Template**:
```
You're correct—it is a rock (or jar of herbs).

The object itself has no inherent power.
The practice you develop in relationship with it
does.

If that relationship hasn't formed, the object
is just material. That's honest assessment.

Not every tool serves every practitioner.

—[Your Name]
```

**Tone**: Doesn't argue, validates their experience, maintains integrity

## 9. The "Lost or Damaged" Policy

### Email Template (Customer Reports Damage)

**Subject**: "Let me replace that"

**Body**:
```
[First Name],

If the [Product Name] arrived damaged, that's
on me (and the shipping carrier, but I'll take
the blame).

Send a photo to [email] and I'll ship a
replacement at no cost.

If the packaging failed to protect it,
I need to know that too—so I can fix it
for the next batch.

—[Your Name]
```

**Policy**: Replace damaged goods, no questions asked  
**Purpose**: Protect reputation, gather feedback on packaging

---

### If Customer Loses Object After Months of Use

**Response**:
```
[First Name],

I'm sorry you lost [Product Name].

Here's the interesting question:
Do you feel like you need to replace it,
or has the practice it supported become
independent of the object itself?

If you need a replacement, I'll offer it
at cost [$X]. Not trying to profit from
your loss.

If you've outgrown the need, that's the
design working. The object was a scaffold.

Your call.

—[Your Name]
```

**Philosophy**: Don't profit from loss, but also don't enable dependency

## 10. Unboxing Video Strategy (Organic Content)

### Don't Create

- ❌ Polished, professional unboxing video (feels like ad)
- ❌ Overly enthusiastic reactions (inauthentic)
- ❌ Multiple camera angles (too produced)

### Do Create (If Authentic)
- ✅ Single-take, phone camera unboxing (real)
- ✅ Quiet observation, not performance
- ✅ Focus on tactile details (texture, weight, scent)
- ✅ No music, no editing tricks

**Publish Where**: YouTube (unlisted), share with early believers only  
**Purpose**: Reference material, not marketing content
