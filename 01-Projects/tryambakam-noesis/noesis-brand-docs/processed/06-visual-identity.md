# Visual Identity Guide: Tryambakam Noesis
## The Visual Language of Self-Authored Meaning

---

## 1. Visual Strategy

### Mood Board Concept: "Grounded Depth"

Tryambakam Noesis's visual identity must embody:
- **Substance over decoration**: Every element earns its place
- **Density without overwhelm**: Information-rich but breathable
- **Timelessness over trend**: Will not look dated in 10 years
- **Earned complexity**: Reveals depth upon sustained attention

### Visual Positioning
| Avoid | Embody |
|-------|--------|
| Ethereal/floating/cosmic | Grounded/rooted/architectural |
| Soft/warm/nurturing | Clear/direct/substantial |
| Minimalist-as-trend | Sparse-as-discipline |
| Tech/startup aesthetic | Atemporal/craft aesthetic |
| Mystical/occult clichés | Symbolic precision |

## 2. Color Palette

### Primary Color: Deep Ink
**Hex**: `#1A1A2E`
**RGB**: 26, 26, 46
**Psychology**: Depth, substance, the unlit space from which meaning emerges. Not black (absence) but deep blue-black (potential).
**Usage**: Primary backgrounds, typography, core elements

### Secondary Color: Bone
**Hex**: `#F5F0E8`
**RGB**: 245, 240, 232
**Psychology**: Organic warmth without softness. The page, the ground, the material substrate.
**Usage**: Background contrast, text on dark, breathing space

### Accent Color: Aged Gold
**Hex**: `#B8860B`
**RGB**: 184, 134, 11
**Psychology**: Earned value, not polished shine. Gravitas. The color of texts that survived centuries.
**Usage**: Highlights, key interactive elements, emphasis (used sparingly)

### Support Color: Stone Grey
**Hex**: `#6B6B6B`
**RGB**: 107, 107, 107
**Psychology**: Neutral ground. Transition space. Neither here nor there.
**Usage**: Secondary text, borders, subtle separations

### Warning/Attention: Terracotta
**Hex**: `#C65D3B`
**RGB**: 198, 93, 59
**Psychology**: Earth-fire. Natural attention without alarm.
**Usage**: Error states, important notices, calls to attention (rare)

## 3. Typography

### Header Font: **Cormorant Garamond**
**Style**: Serif, classical proportions with contemporary refinement
**Weights**: Light (300), Regular (400), SemiBold (600)
**Google Fonts**: [fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond)
**Usage**: Headlines, titles, pull quotes
**Why**: Evokes textual traditions (philosophical texts, historical documents) without feeling archaic. Carries authority without pretension.

### Body Font: **Source Sans 3**
**Style**: Sans-serif, humanist proportions, excellent readability
**Weights**: Regular (400), SemiBold (600)
**Google Fonts**: [fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3)
**Usage**: Body text, UI elements, extended reading
**Why**: Clean without being cold. Technical clarity without clinical sterility. Reads well at all sizes.

### Accent Font: **JetBrains Mono**
**Style**: Monospace, designed for code
**Weights**: Regular (400)
**Google Fonts**: [fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono)
**Usage**: Code blocks, technical specifications, data, timestamps
**Why**: Signals precision. Creates visual distinction for structured content.

### Type Scale
```
H1: 48px / 1.1 line-height (Cormorant Garamond Light)
H2: 36px / 1.2 line-height (Cormorant Garamond Regular)

## 4. Logo Guidelines

### Logo Concept
The Tryambakam Noesis logo operates as a **wordmark with optional sigil**.

**Wordmark**: "Tryambakam Noesis" set in Cormorant Garamond, letter-spaced for weight
- All caps, tracking +100
- Light weight for larger applications
- SemiBold for smaller applications

**Sigil (Secondary Mark)**: Abstract representation of recursive self-reference
- The sigil should reference the Three-Eyed (Tryambakam) geometry — the triangulation of Soma (source), Manas (witness), and Muladhara (grounding). Consider a three-point convergence mark or a stylized third-eye form that avoids mystical cliche.
- A loop that observes itself
- Not Celtic, not ouroboros, not infinity—something earned
- Used only when wordmark space is constrained

### Clear Space
Minimum clear space = height of the "N" in the wordmark on all sides

### Logo Variations
1. **Primary**: Deep Ink on Bone
2. **Reversed**: Bone on Deep Ink
3. **Single Color**: Deep Ink only (for limited applications)
4. **Minimal**: Sigil only (social icons, favicons)

### Logo Don'ts
- Never stretch or distort
- Never add drop shadows or effects
- Never place on busy backgrounds without sufficient contrast
- Never use colors outside the palette
- Never recreate in non-approved fonts

## 5. Imagery & Art Direction

### Photography Style

**When photography is used (rarely):**
- High contrast, natural light
- Textural focus (hands, materials, surfaces)
- Human subjects: partial, not posed (hands at work, figure in landscape)
- No faces looking at camera
- No stock photo warmth/diversity theater

**Subject Matter:**
- Natural materials (stone, wood, paper, metal)
- Architectural details (shadows, geometry)
- Objects in use (worn books, tools, writing implements)
- Landscapes: vast, minimal human presence

### Illustration Style

**When illustration is used:**
- Line-based, high density
- Single color or two-tone max
- Technical/architectural quality
- No soft edges, no gradients
- Evokes: manuscript marginalia, scientific illustration, cartography

**Subject Matter:**
- Diagrams that reward study
- Symbolic systems (but not cliché esoteric)
- Geometric constructions
- Layered compositions with hidden elements

---

## 6. Graphic Elements

### Patterns
**Primary Pattern**: Grid
- Subtle, architectural grid underlying layouts
- Evokes: manuscript ruling, graph paper, structural foundation
- Used at 5-10% opacity as background texture

**Secondary Pattern**: Circles/Arcs
- Perfect geometry, never ornamental
- Evokes: compass constructions, orbital paths
- Used sparingly for section breaks or emphasis

### Textures
**Paper Texture**: Subtle grain on backgrounds
- Not distressed, not vintage—just material
- Evokes the physical substrate of thought

**No Gradients**: Flat colors only
- Transitions happen through opacity, not gradient
- Exception: very subtle vignetting on photographs

### Borders & Lines
- 1px lines only (crisp, precise)
- Deep Ink or Stone Grey
- No rounded corners on containers (sharp = intentional)
- Generous white space as primary separator

---

## 7. Application Examples

### Website
- Dark mode default (Deep Ink background, Bone text)
- Light mode available (Bone background, Deep Ink text)
- Aged Gold for links and key interactions
- Generous margins (content doesn't touch edges)
- Long-form reading optimized (max-width 680px for body text)

### Print
- Uncoated paper stock (tactile, not glossy)
- Deep Ink as dominant, Bone as paper
- Aged Gold for foil stamp or single accent
- Generous margins (evokes manuscript)

### Physical Objects
- Natural materials preferred (wood, metal, paper, ceramic)
- No plastic unless functionally necessary
- Logo debossed or engraved, not printed
- Packaging: minimal, unbleached, no excess

### Social Media
- Sigil mark as avatar
- Quote cards: Deep Ink background, Bone text, single Aged Gold element
- No photography, illustration only
- Consistent square format

## 8. Voice-Visual Alignment

| Voice Principle | Visual Expression |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Grounded | Deep, substantial colors; no floating elements |
| Direct | Sharp edges, clear typography, no decoration |
| Respectful-Challenging | Information density; rewards attention |
| Earned authority | Classical typography; timeless aesthetic |
| Protects ambiguity | Space to breathe; not everything explained |

## Color Accessibility Notes

### Contrast Ratios (WCAG AA Compliant)
- Deep Ink (#1A1A2E) on Bone (#F5F0E8): **14.2:1** ✓
- Bone (#F5F0E8) on Deep Ink (#1A1A2E): **14.2:1** ✓
- Aged Gold (#B8860B) on Deep Ink (#1A1A2E): **5.3:1** ✓
- Aged Gold (#B8860B) on Bone (#F5F0E8): **3.1:1** (use for large text only)

### Color Blindness Considerations
- Palette avoids red-green combinations
- Aged Gold distinguishable from all other colors in deuteranopia/protanopia
- Always include non-color indicators for interactive states
