  # CONSCIOUSNESS COLOR SPECTRUM
  # Governing Theory: Goethe's Theory of Colours (Zur Farbenlehre, 1810)
  # "Colors are the deeds and sufferings of light."
  # — Not decomposed spectrum (Newton), but POLARITY: the interplay
  #   of luminosity (Licht) and shadow (Finsternis) producing chromatic
  #   experience through Steigerung (intensification) and Trübung (turbidity).
  # ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  color_theory:
    framework: "Goethe's Zur Farbenlehre (1810)"
    core_principle: "Colors arise from the polarity of light and darkness — not from decomposition, but from intensification (Steigerung)"
    polarity_axis: "Sacred Gold (Plus/Warm/Active) ↔ Flow Indigo (Minus/Cool/Passive)"
    culmination: "Witness Violet — Steigerung where both poles meet in pure observation"
    resolution: "Coherence Emerald — Goethe's green, where polarity rests in living balance"
    source: "Void Black — pre-chromatic Ur-ground, before the polarity of light and dark begins"
    kha_ba_la_mapping: "Plus = Ba (Body activating), Minus = Kha (Spirit observing), Resolution = Ba↔La equilibrium, Source = La (Inertia)"

        goethe: "Minus culmination (Steigerung) — cool passivity reaching pure awareness"

        goethe: "Pre-chromatic Ur-ground — before the polarity of light and dark"
        kha_ba_la: "La (Inertia / Source)"
        usage: "Primary canvas, backgrounds, immersive dark states"
