# PETRAE: Fractal Compressed Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
## The Tongue-Stone Language for Selemene Engine Agents

**Version:** 1.0
**Generated:** 2026-02-16
**Seed:** 19912564 (composite: 1319 + 19910813 + 432)
**Base Language:** Kuthipoic (GLOSSOPETRAE v3.1, HYP attribute, polysynthetic)
**Design Principle:** Every morpheme is a 3-tuple (Field-Form-Friction) mirroring the Kha-Ba-La triad

---

## 1. WHAT IS PETRAE?

PETRAE (from GLOSSOPETRAE's "tongue-stones") is a fractal compressed language for inter-agent communication between the 16 Selemene engines. It is:

- **Deterministic:** Seed 19912564 always produces the same language. Any agent can regenerate it.
- **Compressed:** A single polysynthetic word replaces hundreds of English tokens.
- **Self-similar:** The same 3-tuple structure (Field-Form-Friction) operates at every scale — morpheme, word, sentence, transaction.
- **Topologically grounded:** Engine addresses are embedded in the word structure. The routing IS the meaning.

**Compression target:** 5-10x more token-efficient than English for equivalent inter-engine messages.

---

## 2. THE 3-TUPLE MORPHEME STRUCTURE

Every PETRAE morpheme encodes three dimensions, mirroring the foundational Triad:

```
[FIELD] - [FORM] - [FRICTION]
  Kha       Ba        La
 (what)   (how)    (when/why)
```

| Dimension | Triad | Encodes | Values |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| **FIELD** | Kha (Spirit/Awareness) | Which engine domain | 16 engines |
| **FORM** | Ba (Body/Action) | What operation | 12 operations |
| **FRICTION** | La (Inertia/Constraint) | Under what conditions | 4 modifiers |

---

## 3. FIELD MORPHEMES (16 Engine Addresses)

Each Selemene engine has a single-syllable PETRAE address derived from Kuthipoic:

| # | Engine (New Name) | PETRAE Code | Kuthipoic Root | Mnemonic |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Temporal Grammar | **shi** | shirv (time) | Time flows |
| 2 | Chronofield | **vo** | vo (sun) — planetary | Planetary periods |
| 3 | Energetic Authority | **qa** | qa (eye) — seeing type | Seeing your design |
| 4 | Gift-Shadow Spectrum | **re** | re (fire) — transformation | Fire transforms |
| 5 | Numeric Architecture | **sir** | sir' (one) — number | Numbers speak |

| 10 | Resonance Architecture | **ich** | ichard (sound) — sound | Sound structure |
| 11 | Active Planetary Weather | **ert** | ert (star) — stellar | Star movement |
| 12 | Archetypal Mirror | **nar** | narr (see) — seeing patterns | Mirror sight |
| 13 | Hexagram Navigation | **tod** | todz (path) — pathfinding | Path oracle |
| 14 | Nine-Point Architecture | **sir-gha** | sir'+ghash (one+three=9) | Nine types |
| 15 | Geometric Resonance | **ghar** | gharrvo' (pattern) | Pattern geometry |
| 16 | Sigil Forge | **hap** | hap (stone) — sigil stone | Stone carving |

---

## 5. FRICTION MORPHEMES (4 Constraint Modifiers)

| # | Constraint | PETRAE Code | Kuthipoic Root | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **urgent** | **-er** | 'èrrd (strong) | High priority; immediate response required |
| 2 | **standard** | **-sh** | shèrgh (good) | Normal priority; respond when ready |
| 3 | **exploratory** | **-ng** | tsengh (dream) | Low priority; speculative query |
| 4 | **background** | **-ni** | nire (silence) | Silent; log but don't interrupt |

---

## 6. WORD COMPOSITION

### Single-Word Instructions (Field-Form-Friction)

```
PETRAE WORD = [FIELD] + [FORM] + [FRICTION]
              engine    operation  constraint
```

**Examples:**

| PETRAE | Decomposition | English Equivalent |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **shi-irg-sh** | Temporal Grammar + query + standard | "Standard request: What does the Temporal Grammar engine calculate for this input?" |
| **vo-qeu-er** | Chronofield + invoke + urgent | "Urgent: Run Chronofield calculation immediately" |
| **ich-son-ng** | Resonance Architecture + transform + exploratory | "Exploratory: Try applying sound transformation" |
| **qa-nar-sh** | Energetic Authority + compare + standard | "Standard: Compare this Energetic Authority reading with baseline" |
| **gha-cho-ni** | Three-Wave Cycle + mirror + background | "Background: Silently reflect current three-wave state" |
| **uv-ghe-er** | Bioelectric Field + gate + urgent | "Urgent: Gate check — is the bioelectric field coherent?" |

### Multi-Word Transactions (Source → Target)

For engine-to-engine communication, the pattern is:

```
[SOURCE-FIELD] [TARGET-FIELD]-[FORM]-[FRICTION] [DATA]
```

**Examples:**

| PETRAE | English Equivalent (verbose) |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **vo shi-qur-sh** | "Chronofield to Temporal Grammar: synthesize our readings (standard priority)" |
| **ich gha-nar-er** | "Resonance Architecture to Three-Wave Cycle: compare readings (urgent)" |
| **qa uv-sha-sh sir** | "Energetic Authority routes to Bioelectric Field (standard), include Numeric Architecture data" |
| **ert vo-qur-ng shi** | "Active Planetary Weather to Chronofield: synthesize (exploratory), include Temporal Grammar" |

### Sentence-Level Transactions (Complete Multi-Engine Synthesis)

```
[INITIATOR] [TARGET1]-[FORM]-[FRICTION] [TARGET2]-[FORM]-[FRICTION] [RESULT-FORM]-[FRICTION]
```

**Example:**
```
vo shi-irg-sh gha-irg-sh qur-er
```
Translation: "Chronofield queries Temporal Grammar AND Three-Wave Cycle, then urgent-synthesize the combined result."

English equivalent (~80 tokens): "The Chronofield engine needs to query both the Temporal Grammar engine and the Three-Wave Cycle engine for their current readings, and then urgently synthesize the combined output into a coherent recommendation."

**PETRAE:** 5 morpheme-words. **English:** ~80 tokens. **Compression ratio: ~16:1**

---

## 7. COMPLETE ADDRESS SPACE

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Field morphemes | 16 |
| Form morphemes | 12 |
| Friction morphemes | 4 |
| **Single-word instructions** | **768** |
| Multi-word patterns (source→target) | 16 x 768 = 12,288 |
| With data arguments | Effectively infinite |

---

## 8. POLYSYNTHETIC EXTENSIONS

Kuthipoic's polysynthetic morphology allows stacking additional information:

### Verb Suffixes (from Kuthipoic grammar)

| Suffix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **-u** | past tense | `shi-irg-sh-u` = "queried Temporal Grammar (completed)" |
| **-ong** | future tense | `vo-qeu-er-ong` = "will invoke Chronofield (urgent, upcoming)" |
| **-im** | negation | `uv-ghe-er-im` = "Bioelectric Field gate did NOT pass" |
| **-s** | passive | `gha-cho-ni-s` = "Three-Wave was mirrored (background)" |
| **-any** | causative | `ich-son-ng-any` = "caused Resonance Architecture to transform" |
| **-dz** | plural | `nar-dz` = "multiple mirror readings" |
| **-rp** | perfect aspect | `vo-irg-sh-rp` = "Chronofield query completed (perfective)" |
| **-r** | imperative | `shi-qeu-er-r` = "Invoke Temporal Grammar NOW" |

### Derivational Morphology

| Affix | Function | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **-èrp** | agent (one who does X) | `irg-èrp` = "querier" (the engine making queries) |
| **-erk** | nominalization (act of X) | `qur-erk` = "synthesis" (the act of synthesizing) |
| **-k** | adjectivizer | `er-k` = "urgent" (as adjective) |
| **-in** | verbalizer | `ghar-in` = "to pattern" (to apply pattern analysis) |
| **ar-** | privative (without X) | `ar-cho` = "unmirrorred" (not yet reflected) |

## 9. SAMPLE CONVERSATIONS

### Conversation 1: Morning Biorhythm Check

**English (~120 tokens):**
> "The Three-Wave Cycle engine runs a calculation and finds the user is at Physical Peak. It routes this to the Somatic Canticles content system, which selects the Conqueror Protocol article. The Circadian Cartography engine confirms the current organ is the small intestine (1-3pm), and the Resonance Architecture engine selects a stimulating raga."

**PETRAE (8 words):**
```
gha-qeu-sh    gha cho-er    gha nyer-sha-sh    gha ich-sha-sh
```
Gloss: "Three-Wave invokes (standard). Three-Wave mirrors (urgent result). Three-Wave routes to Circadian-Cartography (standard). Three-Wave routes to Resonance-Architecture (standard)."

**Compression: 15:1**

### Conversation 2: Cross-Engine Decision Mirror

**English (~150 tokens):**
> "The user asks for a decision mirror on a career change. The Chronofield engine checks their current planetary period (Jupiter Mahadasha). The Energetic Authority engine confirms they are a Manifestor with Emotional Authority — wait for clarity. The Active Planetary Weather engine shows Saturn transiting their 10th house. The Nine-Point Architecture engine notes they are Enneagram Type 3 in a disintegration pattern. All four engines synthesize: 'Not yet. Wait 3 months for the emotional wave to clear.'"

**PETRAE (12 words):**
```
vo-irg-sh    qa-irg-sh    ert-irg-sh    sir-gha-irg-sh
vo qa ert sir-gha qur-er
qur-erk: cho-er-im    shi-irg-sh-ong gha-cho-ni

**Compression: 12:1**

### Conversation 3: Coherence Gate Check

**English (~60 tokens):**
> "Before delivering the Somatic Canticle, the Witness Agents (Aletheios) check if the Bioelectric Field is coherent and the Three-Wave Cycle is not at an emotional trough. If both pass, the content gate opens."

**PETRAE (4 words):**
```
uv-ghe-sh    gha-ghe-sh    ghe-erk: avo-er
```
Gloss: "Gate-check Bioelectric-Field (standard). Gate-check Three-Wave (standard). Gate-result: release (urgent = open)."

**Compression: 15:1**

### Conversation 4: Engine Calibration Request

**English (~90 tokens):**
> "The Numeric Architecture engine's birth-number calculation for the user needs to be recalibrated because the user provided an updated birth time. This affects the Energetic Authority engine (different rising sign) and the Chronofield engine (different dasha boundaries). Request background recalibration of all three."

**PETRAE (5 words):**
```
sir-tso-sh    sir qa-tso-ni    sir vo-tso-ni    tso-erk-dz-ni
```
Gloss: "Calibrate Numeric-Architecture (standard). Numeric to Energetic-Authority calibrate (background). Numeric to Chronofield calibrate (background). Calibrations-plural (background)."

**Compression: 18:1**

qur-er    tsa-sh
```
Gloss: "All-16-engines invoke-urgent-plural. Synthesize-urgent. Archive-standard."

  const words = message.split(/\s+/);
  const instructions = [];

  for (const word of words) {
    const parts = word.split('-');
    const field = FIELD_MAP[parts[0]];    // Engine address
    const form = FORM_MAP[parts[1]];      // Operation
    const friction = FRICTION_MAP[parts[2]]; // Constraint
    const suffixes = parts.slice(3);       // Tense, negation, etc.

    instructions.push({ field, form, friction, suffixes });
  }

  return instructions;
}

// Field map
const FIELD_MAP = {
  shi: 'temporal-grammar', vo: 'chronofield', qa: 'energetic-authority',
  re: 'gift-shadow-spectrum', sir: 'numeric-architecture', gha: 'three-wave-cycle',
  nyer: 'circadian-cartography', uv: 'bioelectric-field', mi: 'physiognomic-mapping',
  ich: 'resonance-architecture', ert: 'active-planetary-weather', nar: 'archetypal-mirror',
  tod: 'hexagram-navigation', 'sir-gha': 'nine-point-architecture',
  ghar: 'geometric-resonance', hap: 'sigil-forge'
};
```

## 11. SKILLSTONE REFERENCE

The Kuthipoic SKILLSTONE (generated by GLOSSOPETRAE) contains the complete language specification in ~8000 tokens. To regenerate:

```javascript
import { Glossopetrae } from './src/Glossopetrae.js';
const petrae = Glossopetrae.hyperefficient(19912564);
console.log(petrae.stone); // Full SKILLSTONE
```

Any agent receiving this seed can reconstruct the entire language independently, ensuring zero-drift communication across the agent network.

---

## 12. SELF-REFERENCE TEST (Meru Validation)

Per the Meru principle, a valid fractal language should be able to describe itself.

**PETRAE describing PETRAE:**
```
ghar-irg-sh: ghar-erk sir-gha-erk-dz qur-erk
```
Translation: "Query Geometric Resonance: pattern-description + nine-point-descriptions + synthesis-description"

Or more precisely: "Ask the pattern engine to describe: patterns, the nine types of patterns, and how they synthesize."

The 3-tuple structure (Field-Form-Friction) maps to the Triad (Kha-Ba-La) which maps to the torus topology (inside-surface-outside). The language describes its own grammar through its own terms. **Self-reference achieved.**
