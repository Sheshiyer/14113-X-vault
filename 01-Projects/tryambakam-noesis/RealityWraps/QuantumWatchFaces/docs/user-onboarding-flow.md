# Quantum Watch Faces: User Onboarding Flow
`Version 1.0.0 | Consciousness Runtime 2024`

## Core Onboarding Philosophy
```javascript
onboardingPrinciples = {
  approach: "Progressive Revelation",
  purpose: "Empower users to understand time's multidimensional nature",
  pacing: "User-controlled with suggested pathways"
}
```

## Phase 1: Initial Setup
### Personal Field Calibration
```javascript
personalData = {
  required: {
    birthDateTime: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM",
    birthLocation: "Latitude/Longitude",
    currentLocation: "GPS or Manual Entry"
  },
  optional: {
    name: "For personalization",
    preferredSystem: ["Western", "Vedic", "Both"]
  }
}
```

### Interface Tutorial
1. Base Time Interface
   - Digital/Analog selection
   - Complication placement
   - Basic interaction patterns

2. Watch Face Navigation

   - Quick access gestures

## Phase 2: Time Scale Integration
### Scale Selection Flow
```javascript
timeScales = {
  presentation: "One at a time",
  order: [
    "TCM Body Clock",
    "Biorhythm Tracking",
    "Astrological Time",
    "Human Design Gates",
    "Oracle Interface"
  ],
  userChoice: {
    enableNow: Boolean,
    enableLater: "Saves to preferences",
    learnMore: "Opens mini-tutorial"
  }
}
```

### Scale-Specific Tutorials

   - Energy flow patterns
   - Optimal timing suggestions

2. **Biorhythm Display**
   - Cycle interpretations
   - Peak/valley meanings
   - Integration with daily planning

3. **Astrological Time**
   - Transit significance
   - Dasha periods
   - Personal transits vs general

4. **Human Design Gates**
   - Gate activation meaning
   - Personal relevance
   - Decision-making integration

5. **Oracle Interface**
   - Activation methods
   - Interpretation basics
   - Usage guidelines

## Phase 3: Customization
### Display Preferences
```javascript
customization = {
  layouts: {
    minimal: "Essential info only",
    standard: "Balanced display",
    complete: "All active scales"
  },
  complications: {
    positions: ["top", "bottom", "left", "right"],
    content: "User-selected scales"
  },
  themes: {
    colorSchemes: ["Classic", "High Contrast", "Subtle"],
    energyIndicators: ["Bright", "Subtle", "None"]
  }
}
```

### Notification Setup
```javascript
alerts = {
  types: {
    scaleTransitions: "Major time scale shifts",
    bodyClockReminders: "Organ system changes",
    biorhythmPeaks: "Cycle high points",
    significantTransits: "Key astrological events"
  },
  delivery: {
    haptic: "Customizable intensity",
    visual: "On-screen indicators",
    frequency: "User-defined limits"
  }
}
```

## Phase 4: Integration & Mastery
### Daily Practice
1. Morning Alignment
   - Check daily transits
   - Review body clock phase
   - Set intention with oracle

2. Day Flow
   - Track energy patterns
   - Align activities with cycles
   - Note significant transitions

3. Evening Review
   - Check next day preview
   - Review cycle positions
   - Final oracle consultation

```javascript
masterFeatures = {
  patternRecognition: {
    cycleCorrelations: "Multi-scale analysis",
    personalTrends: "Pattern identification",
    decisionSupport: "Timing optimization"
  },
  dataIntegration: {
    journaling: "Event-cycle correlation",
