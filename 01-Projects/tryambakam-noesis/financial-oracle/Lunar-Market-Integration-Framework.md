# Lunar-Market Integration Framework
## A Pattern Recognition Protocol for Market Analysis

## Core Premise
The integration of lunar cycles (cera), neuroplasticity (cerebellum), and market behavior creates a multivariate pattern recognition framework for enhanced market analysis and decision-making.

## Foundational Elements

### 1. Lunar-Cerebellum Connection

- Lunar phases affect mass psychology and decision-making
- Neuroplasticity peaks during certain lunar phases

### 2. Market Psychology Matrix
- Technical Analysis (TA)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Social Metrics
- Volume Patterns
- Volatility Indicators

### 3. Astrotheological Overlay
- Lunar Phases
- Planetary Aspects
- Eclipse Patterns
- Nodal Movements
- Archetypal Influences
