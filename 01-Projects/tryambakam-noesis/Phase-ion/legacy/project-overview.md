## 📌 Apple Reminders Context (2025-11-20)

*Captured from user's Apple Reminders for richer product vision:*

> **PHAS-ION** - A modern AI-based 3D volumetric personalized clothing brand for bioelectric coherence using piezoelectric fabric and geometric weaving with magnetic actuators on your etheric circuitry of your body using acupuncture and other eastern modalities to map the spots.
>
> **Product Range**: Starts with 4 actuators for basic, goes up to 27
>
> **Modalities to Integrate**:
> - Polarity therapy
> - Magnetic therapy  
> - Quick EFT points for emotion release and programming
> - Nadi systems and chakras

### Key Insight: "Etheric Circuitry"

The framing of the body's energy system as **etheric circuitry** suggests:
- Hardware metaphor (actuators = nodes)
- Software metaphor (EFT = debugging/programming)
- Network metaphor (Nadi = architecture)

This aligns with TWC's "consciousness as code" philosophy and the Runtime Framework.

### Integration with OASIS
