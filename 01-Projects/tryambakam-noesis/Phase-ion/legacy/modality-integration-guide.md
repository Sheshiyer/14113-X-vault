### Mapping Matrix
```javascript
modalityMapping = {
    polarityTherapy: {
        points: ["north", "south", "east", "west"],
        frequencies: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0],
        patterns: ["linear", "spiral", "vortex"]
    },
    magneticTherapy: {
        strength: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0],
        pulsation: ["constant", "variable", "rhythmic"],
        patterns: ["static", "dynamic", "pulsed"]
    },
    eftPoints: {
        locations: ["meridian", "node", "junction"],
        activation: ["tap", "hold", "pulse"],
        sequences: ["standard", "advanced", "custom"]
    },
    nadiSystem: {
        channels: ["ida", "pingala", "sushumna"],
        flows: ["ascending", "descending", "circular"],
        patterns: ["linear", "spiral", "figure8"]
    },
    chakraNetwork: {
        centers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
        activation: ["sequential", "simultaneous", "pulsed"],
        patterns: ["ascending", "descending", "harmonic"]
    }
}
```
