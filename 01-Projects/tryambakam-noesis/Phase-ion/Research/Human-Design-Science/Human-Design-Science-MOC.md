# 🌀 Human Design Science MOC

> *"Where technology meets the subtle body: designing for wholeness"*

## Overview

Human Design Science bridges:
- **Biofield Research**: Human electromagnetic field studies
- **Neuroscience**: Brain-body-field interactions
- **Health & Wellness**: Holistic monitoring approaches

**Phassion Application**: Garments that support biofield coherence and Human Design alignment.

## 🎨 Phassion Human Design Integration

### Garment as Biofield Interface

**Design Principles**
1. **Support, don't suppress**: Enhance natural biofield function
2. **Selective shielding**: Block harmful, allow beneficial
3. **Coherence enhancement**: Promote heart-brain alignment
4. **Grounding integration**: Earth connection pathways

### Human Design Type Considerations

| Type | Aura Quality | Garment Approach |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Manifestor | Repelling/closed | Boundary support |
| Generator | Open/enveloping | Energy flow channels |
| Projector | Focused/penetrating | Reception enhancement |
| Reflector | Sampling/lunar | Adaptive materials |

### Chakra-Aligned Zones

```
CROWN (Head): Cognitive monitoring, light therapy
THIRD EYE (Forehead): Focus enhancement
THROAT (Neck): Expression support, voice integration
HEART (Chest): Coherence sensors, EMF protection
SOLAR PLEXUS (Abdomen): Emotional wave tracking
SACRAL (Lower abdomen): Energy response sensors
ROOT (Base): Grounding pathways, stability
```

## 🎭 Enneagram Perspective

### Type 9 (Urania/Serotonin) - Harmony
- **Shadow**: Avoiding the complexity of subtle energy
- **Virtue**: Active engagement with wholeness
- **Design Response**: Integrate, don't ignore biofield

### Type 5 (Melpomene/Cortisol) - Investigation
- **Shadow**: Reducing subtle to measurable only
- **Virtue**: Honoring the unmeasurable
- **Design Response**: Leave room for mystery

### Integration Questions
1. How do we honor what we can't measure?
2. When does technology support vs replace intuition?
3. What is the garment's role in spiritual development?
