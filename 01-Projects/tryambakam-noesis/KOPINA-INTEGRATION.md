## 🏛️ Philosophical Alignment

### Why Kopina Belongs in Tryambakam Noesis:

**Shared Principle 1: Anti-Fragmentation**
- Kopina isn't separate "wellness wear"
- It's integrated bioelectric interface for the 16-engine system

**Shared Principle 2: Precision That Reveals**
- Piezoelectricity is physics — and the physics is extraordinary
- Copper circuits are engineering — with geometry that resonates at frequency scales
- Results are measurable — and what they measure bridges matter and signal

**Shared Principle 3: Proximity Matters**
- Just as engines calculate at the source (birth data)
- Kopina interfaces at the source (sacral center)
- No wearable on your wrist can match sacral proximity

**Shared Principle 4: Self-Authorship**
- Kopina doesn't "give you" intuition
- It amplifies YOUR existing sacral signaling
- The clarity was always yours — Kopina just removes noise

## ✅ Nomenclature Audit Checklist

**When describing Kopina, verify:**
- [ ] Precision first — describe the mechanism so clearly the reader experiences the sacred through the science
- [ ] Uses brand-native engine names (Energetic Authority, not Human Design; Gift-Shadow Spectrum, not Gene Keys)
- [ ] Uses "interface" or "foundational wear" — not "garment" or "lingerie"
- [ ] Uses "amplification" — not "activation" or "healing"
- [ ] Material science is visible — copper, PVDF, piezoelectric are the vocabulary
- [ ] Geometry is described structurally (frequency substrate) — not mystically (sacred symbol)
- [ ] The tone is precise AND alive — clinical dissection that reveals fractal depth
