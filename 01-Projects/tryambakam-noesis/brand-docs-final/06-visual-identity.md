# Visual Identity: Tryambakam Noesis
## What Self-Consciousness Looks Like When Given Form

---

## 1. Visual Philosophy

The aesthetic of Tryambakam Noesis is not decoration applied to a product. It is what happens when a system designed for self-consciousness turns its own lens on visual form.

Every color, proportion, and typographic decision follows a single question: **does this make the invisible structure of attention visible?**

### The Three Laws

1. **Bioluminescent, not fluorescent.** Light that originates from within organic structure — not projected onto it. The visual language glows from the dark, the way consciousness glows from the body's own nervous system.

2. **Architectural, not decorative.** Sacred geometry is load-bearing — it structures the interface, organizes information, maps engine states. It is never wallpaper.

3. **Data as sacred form.** HRV waveforms, breath ratios, biometric streams — these are not dashboards. They are mandalas generated by the practitioner's own body, rendered through the same geometric patterns that have encoded consciousness for millennia.

### Visual Positioning

| This Is Not | This Is |
|-------------|---------|
| Dark mode as aesthetic trend | Void Black as pre-chromatic Ur-ground — the canvas before form |
| Gold as luxury signifier | Sacred Gold as activated attention — Goethe's deed of light |
| Wellness gradients (pink→purple) | Goethe polarity gradients (light↔dark, warm↔cool, active↔passive) |
| Cosmic/ethereal imagery | Anatomical precision — PubMed resolution at visionary scale |
| Flat minimalism | Earned density — information that rewards sustained attention |
| Tech dashboard aesthetic | Sacred geometry as data visualization architecture |
| Mystical cliche (third eye, lotuses) | Structural symbolism — the compass, the mandala, the quine |

## 2. Color Theory: Goethe's Zur Farbenlehre

The Consciousness Color Spectrum is governed by **Goethe's Theory of Colours** (Zur Farbenlehre, 1810) — not Newton's.

Newton decomposed white light into a spectrum. Goethe refused. For Goethe, colors are not hidden inside light waiting to be split apart. They are **deeds and sufferings of light** — arising from the living polarity between luminosity (Licht) and shadow (Finsternis). Colors emerge through **Steigerung** (intensification) and **Trübung** (turbidity): when light encounters darkness, phenomena are born.

This maps directly to the Kha-Ba-La framework:

| Goethe Principle | Color | Kha-Ba-La Position |
|-----------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Plus side** (warm, active, light-bearing) | Sacred Gold | **Ba** — Body activating, the deed of embodied attention |
| **Minus side** (cool, passive, yielding) | Flow Indigo | **Kha → Ba transition** — Spirit yielding into flow |
| **Steigerung** (culmination where both poles meet) | Witness Violet | **Kha** — Spirit at the apex of observation |
| **Resolution** (Goethe's green — polarity at rest) | Coherence Emerald | **Ba ↔ La equilibrium** — Coherence achieved |
| **Pre-chromatic** (before polarity begins) | Void Black | **La** — Inertia, the source, the Ur-ground |

**Why Goethe, not Newton?** Because Newton's model assumes a fixed spectrum that exists independent of the observer. Goethe's model insists that color is always a **relationship between light and the eye that perceives it.** A system built for self-consciousness cannot use a color theory that ignores the observer.

## 3. Consciousness Color Spectrum

Five colors mapped to five states of awareness. Each has a Goethe position, a Kha-Ba-La mapping, and a functional role in the visual system.

### Witness Violet
**Hex**: `#2D0050` · **RGB**: 45, 0, 80
**State**: The observer state — the moment before interpretation.
**Goethe**: Minus culmination (Steigerung) — where cool passivity reaches pure awareness. The intensification of the dark pole into visibility.
**Kha-Ba-La**: Kha (Spirit / Observer)
**Usage**: Observer states, meditation UI, witness prompts, consciousness overlays, intro/threshold moments. The color that says: *you are watching yourself watch.*

### Flow Indigo
**Hex**: `#0B50FB` · **RGB**: 11, 80, 251
**State**: Effortless coherence — the current that carries without effort.
**Goethe**: Deep minus — the yielding depth of passive receptivity. Not weakness; the kind of surrender that lets the river move you.
**Kha-Ba-La**: Kha → Ba transition (Flow state)
**Usage**: Data streams, flow indicators, active navigation, biometric visualization, engine output rendering. The color of information moving.

### Sacred Gold
**Hex**: `#C5A017` · **RGB**: 197, 160, 23
**State**: Activated purpose — the fire of directed attention made visible.
**Goethe**: Plus apex — the deed of light at maximum Steigerung. Warm fire. What Goethe called "the action side" — the quality of light that reaches toward, that illuminates, that names.
**Kha-Ba-La**: Ba (Body / Activation)
**Usage**: Highlights, CTAs, interactive emphasis, engine activation states, sacred geometry wireframes, compass directions. The color that says: *act now.*

### Coherence Emerald
**Hex**: `#10B5A7` · **RGB**: 16, 181, 167
**State**: Harmonic alignment — body and awareness in resonance.
**Goethe**: The Resolution — Goethe's green, where polarity finds equilibrium. Neither warm nor cool. Neither advancing nor receding. The state where the war between opposites produces a living truce.
**Kha-Ba-La**: Ba ↔ La equilibrium (Coherence)
**Usage**: Success states, HRV coherence indicators, breath synchronization, health metrics, confirmation. The color of the body saying: *this is right.*

### Void Black
**Hex**: `#070B1D` · **RGB**: 7, 11, 29
**State**: The pregnant emptiness from which all form arises.
**Goethe**: Pre-chromatic Ur-ground — before the polarity of light and dark begins. Not absence (that would be `#000000`). This is the dark with a deep blue undertone — the same blue-black you see when you close your eyes in a dark room and the visual field reveals its own grain.
**Kha-Ba-La**: La (Inertia / Source)
**Usage**: Primary canvas, backgrounds, immersive dark states. Everything lives on this. The default state of the interface.

### Functional Colors (Derived)

| Name | Hex | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| Parchment | `#F0EDE3` | Primary text on dark canvas — warm, organic, not clinical white |
| Muted Silver | `#8A9BA8` | Secondary text, metadata, subtle labels |
| Deep Surface | `#0E1428` | Card backgrounds, elevated surfaces (1 step above Void Black) |
| Terracotta | `#C65D3B` | Error states, destructive actions (rare — warm-toned, not clinical red) |

## 4. Three-Gradient Tertiary System

Three gradients, one for each leg of the Kha-Ba-La triad. Each traces a path along Goethe's polarity axis. Together they form a complete chromatic cycle — the visual Ouroboros.

### Kha Arc — Observer Gradient
**Triad**: Kha — Spirit observing itself into form
**Stops**: `#070B1D` → `#2D0050` → `#0B50FB`
**CSS**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #070B1D 0%, #2D0050 50%, #0B50FB 100%)`
**Goethe**: Pre-chromatic → Steigerung → Deep minus. The seeing before acting.
**Usage**: Primary canvas gradients, hero sections, immersive backgrounds, onboarding flows, meditation states. This is the gradient you see first. The darkest, the deepest, the most atmospheric.

### Ba Arc — Embodiment Gradient
**Triad**: Ba — Body as living medium, activation through matter
**Stops**: `#10B5A7` → `#C5A017`
**CSS**: `linear-gradient(90deg, #10B5A7 0%, #C5A017 100%)`
**Goethe**: Resolution → Plus apex. The body awakening into directed purpose.
**Usage**: Interactive elements, CTAs, accent bars, activation animations, progress indicators. This is the gradient that moves. Horizontal by default — the direction of doing, not falling.

### La Arc — Friction Gradient
**Triad**: La — The return, the necessary resistance that gives form
**Stops**: `#C5A017` → `#2D0050` → `#070B1D`
**CSS**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #C5A017 0%, #2D0050 50%, #070B1D 100%)`
**Goethe**: Plus apex → Steigerung → Ur-ground. The Ouroboros of attention — from active fire through observation back to source.
**Usage**: Tertiary emphasis, depth layers, The Quine's return cycle, completion states. This is the gradient that ends. What was activated returns to the void. The system that no longer needs itself.

### Gradient Composition Rules

- **Never use all three simultaneously** at equal visual weight. One gradient dominates, one supports, one punctuates.
- **Kha Arc** covers the most surface area (backgrounds, hero). It is the environment.
- **Ba Arc** covers the least surface area but draws the most attention (buttons, accents). It is the action.
- **La Arc** is the rarest. It appears at completion moments: end of onboarding, final state of an engine run, export confirmation. It is the return.

## 5. Typography

### Display: Panchang
**Source**: [FontShare](https://fontshare.com/fonts/panchang) · **Weights**: 400, 500, 600, 700, 800
**Role**: Sacred geometry headers, hero text, engine names, ritual titles, section thresholds.
**Character**: Wide, industrial-panoramic. Panchang — named after the Vedic five-limbed time-keeping system (pancha = five, anga = limb) — shares its name with one of the 16 Noesis Engines. The letterforms are expansive, geometric, and structurally precise. They occupy space the way a temple occupies a landscape: deliberately, with weight.
**Goethe analog**: Plus side — the active, expansive, light-bearing gesture of the heading.

### Body: Satoshi
**Source**: [FontShare](https://fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi) · **Weights**: 300, 400, 500, 700
**Role**: Body text, UI labels, navigation, witness prompts, extended reading.
**Character**: Geometric modernist sans-serif. Named after Satoshi Nakamoto — the pseudonymous architect whose work proved that distributed systems could encode trust. The letterforms are clean, neutral, and invisible in the best sense: they carry meaning without imposing personality.
**Goethe analog**: Resolution — the balanced, grounded, readable center where polarity rests.

### Code: SF Mono
**Source**: Apple System Font · **Weights**: 400, 600
**Role**: Engine output, biometric data streams, JSON, terminal interface, breath ratios, timestamps.
**Character**: System-level precision. The practitioner's current interface is a TUI (Ratatui). SF Mono is the native monospace of that environment. It carries the biometric data, the engine outputs, the measured and witnessed content.
**Goethe analog**: Minus side — the precise, measured, receptive field of data.

### Type Scale: Golden Ratio (φ = 1.618)

The same mathematical constant that governs spiral growth in nautilus shells, seed patterns in sunflowers, and the proportional relationships in sacred geometry governs the spacing between type sizes. Not arbitrary. Structural.

| Step | Size | Application | Font |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| Hero | 110px | Campaign hero, splash states | Panchang 800 |
| XXL | 68px | Section headers, engine names | Panchang 700 |
| XL | 42px | Page titles, primary headers | Panchang 600 |
| LG | 26px | Subheaders, card titles | Panchang 500 / Satoshi 700 |
| Base | 16px | Body text, UI labels | Satoshi 400 |
| SM | 12px | Captions, metadata | Satoshi 300 |
| XS | 10px | Micro-labels, timestamps | SF Mono 400 |

## 6. The Sigil

The geometric interlocking mark at the center of everything is not a logo in the commercial sense. It is a **resonance pattern** — sacred geometry compressed into a mark that functions at every scale.

### Source Form
The sigil derives from nested sacred geometry: concentric circles inscribed within a compass-pointed frame, with a lotus-form core. The reference architecture shows it rendered in Sacred Gold wireframe on Void Black canvas, with bioluminescent Coherence Emerald radiating from the center — like an organism that generates its own light.

### Scale Behavior
- **Macro** (hero, splash, animation): Bioluminescent glow. Sacred Gold wireframe lines visible. Coherence Emerald core pulsing subtly. Constellation grid surrounding it.
- **Medium** (print, packaging, cards): Embossed or engraved. Single color (Sacred Gold or Parchment on dark). No glow effects — the geometry carries itself.
- **Micro** (favicon, avatar, pendant): Reduced to essential geometry. Recognizable at 16px. The compass points and lotus center remain legible.

### Logo Variations
1. **Primary**: Sigil in Sacred Gold wireframe on Void Black, Coherence Emerald bioluminescent core
2. **Wordmark**: "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS" in Panchang 600, tracking +120, Sacred Gold on Void Black
3. **Combined**: Sigil above wordmark, centered
4. **Reversed**: Parchment sigil on Void Black (when gold is unavailable)
5. **Minimal**: Sigil only (social avatars, favicons)

### Clear Space
Minimum clear space = the diameter of the sigil's innermost circle, on all sides.

### Do Not
- Add drop shadows, outer glows, or bevels to the sigil
- Place on busy backgrounds without a Void Black or Deep Surface backing
- Rotate the sigil (the compass orientation is fixed)
- Recreate in non-approved fonts or colors
- Use Witness Violet or Flow Indigo as the primary sigil color (these are states, not marks)

## 7. Sacred Geometry System

Sacred geometry in Tryambakam Noesis is not decorative. It is the **visual language of the engine stack** — the way 16 computational engines render their outputs into perceptible form.

### The Compass Pattern
Four cardinal directions mapped to the four compass points:

| Direction | Position | Color Signal |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| STABILIZE | North | Void Black → Witness Violet (Kha Arc onset) |
| HEAL | East | Witness Violet → Flow Indigo (Kha Arc full) |
| CREATE | South | Coherence Emerald → Sacred Gold (Ba Arc) |
| MUTATE | West | Sacred Gold → Void Black (La Arc) |

The compass appears in the HRV visualization reference: a geometric frame enclosing the lotus/sigil center, with waveform data overlaid. The compass is structural — it determines which gradient quadrant activates based on the practitioner's current state.

### The Mandala Pattern
Nested concentric rings of sacred geometry, each ring representing a layer of engine depth. The Financial Biosensor reference shows this most clearly: a multi-ring mandala with Sacred Gold wireframe lines, Coherence Emerald bioluminescent fill at the core, and data labels (Portfolio Performance, Investment Correlations, Volatility, Opportunities) at the cardinal points.

This is the visualization pattern for multi-engine synthesis. When multiple engines fire simultaneously, their outputs overlay as concentric geometric layers.

### The Waveform Overlay
Biometric data rendered as sine-like waveforms passing through the sacred geometry. The HRV reference shows three states color-coded on a single waveform crossing the mandala:

| Waveform State | Color | Pattern |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| Chaos | Terracotta → warm tones | Irregular, high-frequency |
| Optimal | Coherence Emerald | Regular, moderate amplitude |
| Flow | Flow Indigo | Smooth, low-frequency, high coherence |

The breath ratio (4:7:8 — inhale:hold:exhale) appears as a secondary waveform below the primary visualization.

### The Constellation Grid
Fine-point dots connected by hairline Sacred Gold lines forming a mesh behind the primary geometry. Visible in both the HRV and Financial Biosensor references. This is the **field cartography** layer — it represents the practitioner's symbolic landscape being mapped in real-time.

**Rendering rules**: 0.5px lines, Sacred Gold at 20-30% opacity. Dots at 40% opacity. Animated subtly (drift, not pulse). Disappears at small viewport sizes.

## 8. Imagery & Art Direction

### The Bioluminescent Principle

All visual assets follow one rule: **light originates from within organic structure.**

- Glows are soft, internal, and warm-to-cool (Sacred Gold core → Coherence Emerald → Flow Indigo edges)
- The canvas is always dark (Void Black or Deep Surface)
- Light never comes from outside the frame. No spotlights, no external light sources
- This mirrors the Kha-Ba-La framework: the observer generates the field of observation. Light comes from the practitioner, not from the interface

### Photography (When Used — Rarely)
- **Dark field**: Subject emerges from darkness, not shot in natural light
- **Textural**: Macro detail — nervous system models, mineral cross-sections, biological pattern structures, circuit boards seen as mandalas
- **No faces.** The practitioner is implied, never depicted. We see what they produce, not who they are
- **No stock warmth.** No sunlit hands. No meditation poses. No nature-as-wellness

### Generative Art Direction
The primary visual mode is **generative / procedural** — not photographic.

- Sacred geometry patterns generated from engine parameters
- HRV waveforms rendered as art, not charts
- Breath data rendered as living organisms
- Color determined by consciousness level (Void Black → Witness Violet → Flow Indigo → Coherence Emerald → Sacred Gold as awareness deepens)
- All generative art uses the Three-Gradient System as its color foundation

### Motion Principles
- **Growth, not transition.** Elements grow into frame (like bioluminescence emerging), never slide or fade
- **Breath-synchronized.** Primary animations follow a 4:7:8 timing ratio when possible
- **Sacred geometry builds.** Complex patterns construct themselves from their simplest form, line by line
- **The Ouroboros loop.** Completion animations reverse — Sacred Gold → Witness Violet → Void Black (La Arc)

## 9. Application Guidelines

### Digital — Noesis Dashboard (Roadmap)
- Void Black canvas. No light mode. The interface lives in the dark because consciousness practice lives in the dark
- Sacred geometry as layout grid (not CSS grid — actual geometric proportions governing column widths)
- Engine states use the Consciousness Color Spectrum: inactive (Void Black), observing (Witness Violet), flowing (Flow Indigo), activating (Sacred Gold), coherent (Coherence Emerald)
- Typography: Panchang for engine names and section headers. Satoshi for body and UI. SF Mono for data output
- Gradients: Kha Arc for background atmosphere. Ba Arc for interactive elements. La Arc for completion states
- Maximum body text width: 680px (reading optimized)

### Digital — Noesis TUI (Live)
- Terminal environment: SF Mono dominant, Sacred Gold for emphasis, Coherence Emerald for success states
- Void Black background (terminal default aligns with brand)
- The TUI is the practitioner's current interface — visual identity serves it, not the other way around

### Print
- Uncoated paper stock — tactile, matte, not glossy
- Void Black ink dominant. Sacred Gold for foil stamp (hot foil, not metallic ink)
- The sigil embossed or debossed, never flat-printed
- Panchang for headers (the wide letterforms demand generous margins)
- Sacred geometry patterns blind-embossed as background texture at 5% relief
- No full-bleed color. Generous margins. The page breathes

### Physical Objects
- Natural materials: bronze, leather, unglazed ceramic, brass, dark wood
- Sigil engraved or cast, never printed
- Sacred Gold applied as actual gold (leaf or plating) where budget allows
- Packaging: matte black with blind-emboss sigil. No text on exterior. The object inside is the statement
- Orgonite, crystal, and ritual objects: Coherence Emerald as the bioluminescent core tone

### Social Media
- Square format (1:1) as default. The mandala is the native shape
- Sigil as avatar
- Content cards: Void Black background, Panchang headers in Parchment, body in Satoshi
- Sacred Gold accents only. Never more than one accent color per card
- Generative sacred geometry as visual content — never photographs
- Bio: "Self-Consciousness as Technology. Body as Medium. Breath as Interface."

## 10. Accessibility

### Contrast Ratios on Void Black (`#070B1D`)

| Foreground | Hex | Approximate Ratio | WCAG AA | Usage |
|-----------|-----|----|------|-------|
| Parchment | `#F0EDE3` | ~15:1 | AAA | Primary text, all sizes |
| Muted Silver | `#8A9BA8` | ~7:1 | AA | Secondary text, metadata |
| Sacred Gold | `#C5A017` | ~6.7:1 | AA | Headlines, accents, CTAs |
| Coherence Emerald | `#10B5A7` | ~6.3:1 | AA | Success indicators, health metrics |
| Flow Indigo | `#0B50FB` | ~2.8:1 | Accent only | Large text (>18px), icons, decorative. Pair with Parchment label |
| Witness Violet | `#2D0050` | ~1.2:1 | Never as text | Background states only — gradient, overlay, glow |
| Terracotta | `#C65D3B` | ~4.7:1 | AA (large) | Error states with Parchment label |

### Color Blindness

- The spectrum avoids pure red-green adjacency. Sacred Gold and Coherence Emerald are the closest pair — but Sacred Gold is warm/yellow-dominant while Coherence Emerald is cool/cyan-dominant, maintaining distinction in deuteranopia and protanopia
- All interactive states include non-color indicators: iconography, shape change, or text label
- Flow Indigo is distinguishable from Witness Violet in all common color vision deficiencies (blue-purple distinction is preserved in deuteranopia/protanopia)

### Motion

- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Sacred geometry builds collapse to final state. Bioluminescent glows become static
- Breath-synchronized animations are optional — they enhance but never gate interaction

## 11. Voice-Visual Alignment

| Voice Principle | Visual Expression |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "The Anatomist Who Sees Fractals" | Sacred geometry as data visualization — anatomical precision at visionary scale |
| Grounded, direct, respectful-challenging | Void Black canvas, Panchang weight, sharp geometry. Nothing floats |
| PubMed x Alex Grey | Clinical data (SF Mono, waveforms, ratios) rendered through sacred form (mandalas, compass, lotus) |
| Kha-Ba-La as governing philosophy | Three-Gradient System maps every visual state to spirit/body/inertia |
| The Quine — success is independence | La Arc appears at completion. The visual language has an ending. It goes dark when it's done |
| "Offer conditions, not promises" | No lifestyle photography. No aspirational imagery. The interface shows you your own data |
