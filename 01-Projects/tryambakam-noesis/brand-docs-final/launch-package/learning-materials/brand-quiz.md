- [ ] Kha
- [ ] Ba
- [x] La
- [ ] Noesis

**Hint:** Think of the specific Sanskrit-derived syllable associated with 'Breath as Interface' in the brand tagline.

## Question 2
The 'Seeker-Simon' persona is described by a specific 'Defining Paradox.' What is this paradox?

- [ ] Financially unstable but internally wealthy
- [x] Externally free but internally running inherited code
- [ ] Highly tech-savvy but afraid of artificial intelligence
- [ ] Intellectually simple but spiritually complex

**Hint:** Consider the gap between achieved geographic/financial independence and automatic interior responses.

## Question 3
Tryambakam Noesis is described as a 'Quine.' What is the fundamental design principle of a Quine in this context?

- [x] The system succeeds only when the user no longer needs it
- [ ] The system expands indefinitely to capture all wisdom traditions
- [ ] The system requires a lifetime subscription to maintain results
- [ ] The system utilizes artificial intelligence to automate the healing process

**Hint:** Reflect on the software engineering concept of a program that produces its own source code as output.

## Question 4
According to the product positioning, why do 'Meditation Apps' typically fail the Seeker-Simon persona?

- [x] They provide habit without philosophy or adaptation to biorhythmic state
- [ ] They are too expensive for the average consultant's income
- [ ] They require too much technical knowledge of APIs
- [ ] They focus exclusively on somatic data at the expense of intellect

**Hint:** Think about the 'Kha-Ba-La gap' mentioned in the failed solutions analysis.

## Question 5
The Noesis Engine consists of 16 engines divided into two technical categories. Which of the following correctly describes the distribution?

- [ ] 8 Rust cores for precision, 8 Python bridges for logic
- [x] 11 Rust cores for precision, 5 TypeScript bridges for symbolic interpretation
- [ ] 16 Rust engines to ensure maximum performance across all traditional lenses
- [ ] 5 Rust cores for biofield data, 11 TypeScript bridges for Vedic calculations

**Hint:** High-precision astronomical calculations require a systems-level language, while symbolic interpretation uses a more flexible bridge language.

## Question 6
The Noesis Engine compass resolves into four cardinal directions. Which direction is specifically associated with 'metabolizing' surfacing material rather than just managing it?

- [ ] STABILIZE
- [x] HEAL
- [ ] CREATE
- [ ] MUTATE

- [ ] Witness Violet
- [ ] Sacred Gold
- [x] Coherence Emerald
- [ ] Flow Indigo

**Hint:** This color is used for success states and HRV coherence indicators in the UI.

## Question 8
What is the specific purpose of the '.init Protocols' in the practitioner's daily engagement?

- [x] To serve as 90-second micro-ritual thresholds using breath, gesture, and declaration
- [ ] To provide a secure login method for the Selemene API
- [ ] To automate the calculation of Nakshatra and Panchanga data
- [ ] To track the user's progress through a competitive leaderboard

**Hint:** Consider the term 'interface' and the requirement for a 90-second embodied action.

## Question 9
The 'Somatic Canticles' sci-fi trilogy uses a unique prose principle. How is this principle described?

- [ ] Lord of the Rings x Cyberpunk
- [x] PubMed x Alex Grey
- [ ] Silicon Valley x Vedic Sutras
- [ ] National Geographic x Jungian Psychology

**Hint:** Look for a combination of a medical database and a visionary artist known for anatomical 'Sacred Mirrors'.

## Question 10
Which mathematical constant governs the type scale and proportional relationships within the Tryambakam Noesis visual identity?

- [x] The Golden Ratio ($\phi \approx 1.618$)
- [ ] The square root of 2 ($\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$)
- [ ] Euler's number ($e \approx 2.718$)
- [ ] Pi ($\pi \approx 3.141$)

**Hint:** This constant is also known as 'phi' and is found in the growth patterns of sunflowers and nautilus shells.

## Question 11
How does the 'Somatic Canticles' reading experience adapt to the individual practitioner?

- [ ] It delivers chapters based on the user's current heart rate variability (HRV)
- [x] It synchronizes chapter access to the user's birth-date-derived 'Three-Wave Cycle' biorhythms
- [ ] It requires a soulbound token to unlock subsequent chapters
- [ ] It randomizes the order of chapters based on current planetary transits

**Hint:** The adaptation is 'biologically grounded' using physical, emotional, and intellectual peaks and troughs.

## Question 12
What is the 'hidden architectural skeleton' that governs the narrative structure of 'The Plumber' manga series?

- [ ] The Periodic Table of Elements
- [x] The 78-card Thoth-Crowley Tarot deck
