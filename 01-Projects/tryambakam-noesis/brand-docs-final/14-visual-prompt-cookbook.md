### V3 Sigil Definition

A **resonance pattern** — nested sacred geometry with compass-pointed frame and lotus-form core.

- Sacred Gold (`#C5A017`) wireframe lines on Void Black canvas
- Coherence Emerald (`#10B5A7`) bioluminescent glow radiating from center
- Compass points (STABILIZE / HEAL / CREATE / MUTATE) at cardinal positions
- Constellation grid surrounding: 0.5px Sacred Gold lines at 20-30% opacity
- Scale: macro = bioluminescent glow + wireframe visible; medium = embossed single color; micro = essential geometry at 16px

NOT a third eye, NOT a triangle, NOT a mandala cliche — a load-bearing geometric pattern that functions as both mark and map.

## Section 1: Brand Identity (3 Image Prompts)

### 1A. Brand Kit Bento Grid — Bioluminescent Consciousness

**Model:** `fal-ai/nano-banana-pro` | **Size:** `landscape_16_9` | **Steps:** 40 | **Guidance:** 7.5

```
Tryambakam Noesis (Practice Platform for Self-Consciousness).
Act as Lead Brand Designer creating a comprehensive "Brand Identity System" presentation (Bento-Grid Layout).

Generate a single high-resolution bento-grid board containing 6 distinct modules:

PHASE 1: VISUAL STRATEGY
1. Analyze the Brand: Archetype = "The Anatomist Who Sees Fractals." Visual vibe = bioluminescent consciousness -- sacred geometry as data visualization, Goethe's color theory (polarity not spectrum), dark-canvas architecture.
2. Define the Palette: Void Black #070B1D (primary canvas), Witness Violet #2D0050 (observer), Flow Indigo #0B50FB (flow), Sacred Gold #C5A017 (activation), Coherence Emerald #10B5A7 (resolution), Parchment #F0EDE3 (text).
3. Select Typography: Panchang (display -- wide industrial-panoramic). Satoshi (body -- geometric modernist).

PHASE 2: THE LAYOUT (6-MODULE GRID)
Block 1 (The Hero): Void Black (#070B1D) canvas. Sacred geometry compass pattern rendered in Sacred Gold (#C5A017) wireframe with Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7) bioluminescent core. Kha Arc gradient (#070B1D → #2D0050 → #0B50FB) atmospheric background. Constellation grid: hairline Sacred Gold dots connected at 20% opacity. Overlay "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS" wordmark in Parchment (#F0EDE3), Panchang font, wide tracking +120.
Block 2 (Social Media): Post mockup -- Void Black (#070B1D) background with subtle constellation grid pattern at 5% opacity, centered text in Panchang: "Self-Consciousness as Technology." Sacred Gold accent line below. Clean, no imagery.
Block 3 (The Palette): 5 Vertical Color Swatches in order -- Void Black #070B1D, Witness Violet #2D0050, Flow Indigo #0B50FB, Sacred Gold #C5A017, Coherence Emerald #10B5A7. Simulated HEX codes inside each. Parchment text labels. Deep Surface (#0E1428) backing.
Block 4 (Typography Spec): "Panchang" displayed in Panchang font, wide and geometric. Tiny "Primary Display" subtext in Satoshi. Show the φ=1.618 Golden Ratio scale hierarchy.
Block 5 (The Sigil): Sacred geometry resonance pattern -- nested concentric circles within compass-pointed frame, lotus-form core. Sacred Gold wireframe on Void Black. Coherence Emerald bioluminescent glow from center. Clean vector rendering.
Block 6 (Brand DNA): Manifesto Card -- ARCHETYPE: "The Anatomist Who Sees Fractals." VOICE: "Grounded, direct, respectful-challenging." FRAMEWORK: "Kha-Ba-La: Spirit observes. Body walks. Inertia gives form."

PHASE 3: AESTHETIC & FINISH
Style: Behance Trend / Awwwards Winner. Quality: 8K resolution. No rounded corners -- sharp edges only. 1px borders in Muted Silver (#8A9BA8). Generous negative space. Bioluminescent: light originates from within, not projected.
```

### 1B. Embossed Bronze Seal — Resonance Pattern Sigil

**Model:** `fal-ai/flux-2-pro` | **Size:** `square_hd` | **Steps:** 40 | **Guidance:** 7.5

```
A cast bronze disc seal depicting the Tryambakam Noesis resonance pattern sigil -- nested sacred geometry with compass points and lotus-form core -- lying flat on Void Black (#070B1D) surface. Thick patinated bronze with warm Sacred Gold (#C5A017) on raised surfaces, darker oxidation in recessed geometry. Clear relief impression of the sigil in center with "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS" lettering around the rim in Panchang font. The four compass directions marked at cardinal points: STABILIZE (N), HEAL (E), CREATE (S), MUTATE (W) in micro-engraved SF Mono. A faint bioluminescent Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7) glow visible in the lotus core as if the bronze itself carries light from within. Soft diffuse lighting from above, Sacred Gold specular highlights on curved edges. Minimal shadow. The disc has the weight and patina of temple architecture -- substantial, earned, structural. Dark leather surface beneath. No external decorative elements.
```

---

### 1C. Foil-Stamped Wordmark — Sacred Gold on Void

**Model:** `fal-ai/flux-2-pro` | **Size:** `landscape_16_9` | **Steps:** 40 | **Guidance:** 7.5

```
Hot gold-foil stamped "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS" on matte Void Black (#070B1D) paper surface. Panchang font, wide geometric letterforms, tracking +120, all caps. The foil is true Sacred Gold (#C5A017) -- not metallic ink, actual foil catching light with micro-reflections at different angles across each letterform. Below the wordmark: the resonance pattern sigil rendered in blind emboss (same black on black -- visible only through shadow and light angle). The paper has subtle texture -- not glossy, not coated. The edges of the foil show the faintest bleed where gold meets matte. A single hairline in Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7) separates wordmark from sigil -- the only color that is not gold or black. Top-down view. Soft directional light from upper-left creating subtle gradient across the foil surface. 8K detail on paper grain and foil texture. No other elements. No borders. No decoration. The constraint is the statement.
```

## Section 2: Product Concepts (3 Image Prompts)

### 2A. Ritual Kit — Physical Practice Objects

**Model:** `fal-ai/flux-2-pro` | **Size:** `landscape_4_3` | **Steps:** 40 | **Guidance:** 7.5

```
Tryambakam Noesis ritual practice kit -- curated set of physical objects for embodied inquiry. Knolling composition on matte Void Black (#070B1D) surface:

1. Bronze orgonite pyramid (3 inches) with Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7) resin core visible through faceted geometry
2. Handcrafted unglazed ceramic incense holder with the resonance pattern sigil impressed into clay, holding a single unlit incense stick
3. Small dark leather pouch with blind-embossed sigil, holding engine-matched essential oil attars (3 small amber glass vials visible)
4. Bronze resonance pendant on black cord -- compass geometry, Sacred Gold (#C5A017) patina on raised surfaces
5. Practice journal: matte black cover, Sacred Gold foil-stamped sigil, Panchang font "NOESIS" spine text

Every object uses natural materials: bronze, leather, unglazed ceramic, dark wood, amber glass. The sigil is engraved or cast or impressed into material -- never printed. Sacred Gold (#C5A017) as metal patina, not paint. Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7) visible only in the orgonite core -- like bioluminescence trapped in geometry.

Lighting: dark-field. Objects emerge from darkness. A single directional warm light from upper-left creates Sacred Gold highlights on bronze surfaces and amber glass. Deep shadows. No external light source visible. The objects glow from within their own material density.

No greenery. No decoration. No lifestyle context. Just the objects. The austerity is the statement. 8K macro detail on material textures -- bronze grain, leather fibres, ceramic pores, glass amber.
```

### 2B. Somatic Canticles — Sci-Fi Trilogy Volume

**Model:** `fal-ai/flux-2-pro` | **Size:** `portrait_4_3` | **Steps:** 40 | **Guidance:** 7.5

```
Tryambakam Noesis.
Act as creative director. OBJECT: A philosophical sci-fi book -- "Somatic Canticles Vol. I: Anamnesis Engine."

MATERIALS: Cover in matte Void Black (#070B1D) cloth with subtle woven texture. Sacred Gold (#C5A017) hot-foil lettering on spine: "SOMATIC CANTICLES" in Panchang font, wide tracking. Front cover: the resonance pattern sigil blind-embossed (black on black, visible only through light angle). Pages are uncoated warm stock in Parchment (#F0EDE3), deckle edges. Sewn binding visible at spine hinge. A thin bookmark ribbon in Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7).

PRESENTATION: Book alone, slightly open to reveal interior pages. Visible on the open page: a sacred geometry compass diagram rendered in Sacred Gold (#C5A017) ink -- four compass directions (STABILIZE, HEAL, CREATE, MUTATE) at cardinal points, engine names in SF Mono radiating from center. The diagram is functional, not decorative -- it is a chapter-opening navigation map. Body text visible in Satoshi, set at generous margins.

ENVIRONMENT: Void Black surface. The book is the only object. A faint Kha Arc gradient (#070B1D → #2D0050) atmosphere in the deep background -- as if the darkness has depth, not flatness. Dark-field lighting: the book emerges from darkness. Sacred Gold warm highlights on the foil spine and page edges where light catches. The pages glow with Parchment warmth.

GRAPHIC OVERLAY: Bottom Left: "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS — SOMATIC CANTICLES — VOL. I" in Satoshi Regular, Muted Silver (#8A9BA8). Bottom Right: Resonance pattern sigil, monochrome Parchment, 40px.

### 2C. Essential Oil Vial — Engine-Matched Attar

**Model:** `fal-ai/flux-2-pro` | **Size:** `square_hd` | **Steps:** 40 | **Guidance:** 7.5

```
Tryambakam Noesis essential oil attar vial. Single defining product container: hyper-minimal, dark-field. Small amber glass bottle (15ml) with brushed bronze dropper cap. The resonance pattern sigil etched directly into the glass surface (no paper label) -- etching filled with Sacred Gold (#C5A017) pigment. Brand name "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS" etched below sigil in SF Mono. Secondary text: "CHRONOFIELD — ENGINE ATTAR — 15ML" in micro SF Mono. The amber glass contains dark amber-gold liquid catching Sacred Gold light.

Pure Void Black (#070B1D) background. Dark-field studio lighting: single directional warm light from above-left creating a Sacred Gold (#C5A017) highlight on the glass shoulder and bronze cap. A Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7) edge-glow along the bottle silhouette -- as if the glass itself produces faint bioluminescence. Deep Parchment (#F0EDE3) reflection on the surface below.

No greenery. No decoration. No context. The bottle alone. Bronze cap patina. Glass transparency. Amber liquid. The constraint is the luxury. 8K detail on glass etching, bronze grain, liquid viscosity.
```

## Section 3: Illustration Styles (4 Image Prompts + Icon System)

### 3A. Heritage Engraving — Resonance Pattern Sigil

**Model:** `fal-ai/recraft/v3/text-to-image` | **Size:** `square_hd` | **Style:** `digital_illustration`
**Colors:** `["#070B1D", "#F0EDE3", "#C5A017"]`

```
Tryambakam Noesis. Act as a master engraver creating a heritage engraving of the resonance pattern sigil.

STYLE: Precision engraving -- thin delicate hairlines, cross-hatching as geometric pattern (not organic). Clean, airy, architectural. The aesthetic of an 18th-century scientific illustration meets sacred geometry.

THE SYMBOL: The Tryambakam Noesis resonance pattern -- nested concentric circles within a compass-pointed frame, lotus-form core. Rendered as precision engraving: each geometric layer visible as a distinct concentric ring. The four compass directions (STABILIZE, HEAL, CREATE, MUTATE) marked at cardinal points in micro-engraved text. Surrounding the sigil: constellation grid points connected by hairline threads. Fibonacci spiral annotations visible as dimensional reference. Below the sigil: the 16 engine names arranged in two columns (11 left, 5 right) in SF Mono micro-text.

TYPOGRAPHY: "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS" in wide geometric display (Panchang-style). Elegant letter spacing. Below: "EST. MMXXVI — SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AS TECHNOLOGY" in lighter weight.

MATERIAL: Clean solid Parchment (#F0EDE3) paper. Void Black (#070B1D) engraving lines. Sacred Gold (#C5A017) accent on compass direction markers only. No color beyond these three. No borders -- the geometry contains itself.
```

### 3C. The Plumber — Manga Episode Cover

**Model:** `fal-ai/recraft/v3/text-to-image` | **Size:** `portrait_4_3` | **Style:** `digital_illustration`
**Colors:** `["#070B1D", "#C5A017", "#F0EDE3"]`

```
Manga episode cover illustration of The Plumber -- the axis mundi figure of Tryambakam Noesis. A solitary figure seen from behind, standing at the base of a vast vertebral column rising like a spinal axis through layered concentric sacred geometry into deep Void Black (#070B1D) space. The figure rendered in minimalist black-and-white manga style -- clean linework, flat Parchment (#F0EDE3) tones, sharp shadows. The figure is grounded -- feet planted, wearing structured minimal clothing. The vertebral column rendered as anatomical precision -- each vertebra distinct, with Sacred Gold (#C5A017) wireframe sacred geometry radiating outward from the spine at each vertebral level. The geometry increases in complexity as it rises -- simple compass points at lumbar, full mandala pattern at cervical, the resonance pattern sigil at the crown. No mystical imagery, no lotus cliche, no third eye -- the sublime is in the anatomy. The architecture of the body IS the sacred geometry. Void Black (#070B1D) background. Faint constellation grid at edges. Title: "THE PLUMBER — EPISODE I" in Panchang font at top, Sacred Gold.

## Section 5: Video Direction (2 Sequences)

### 5A. Brand Film: "The Practice" (3-Shot Sequence)

**Model:** `fal-ai/kling-video/v3/pro` | **Format:** 16:9 | **Duration:** ~18s

**Shot 1 (5s) — Macro/Detail:**
```
Extreme close-up of hands placing a bronze resonance pendant onto matte Void Black (#070B1D) surface. The pendant's Sacred Gold (#C5A017) patina catches warm directional light. The compass geometry visible in macro detail -- STABILIZE, HEAL, CREATE, MUTATE micro-engraved at cardinal points. Shallow depth of field. Dark-field lighting. Sound: metal-on-surface contact, resonant bronze tone.
```

**Shot 2 (7s) — Tracking/Data:**
```
Slow tracking shot across the 16 engine schematic diagrams printed in Sacred Gold (#C5A017) ink on Void Black paper, arranged in a grid. Each diagram rendered as precision sacred geometry. Camera moves left-to-right, shallow DOF rack-focusing across papers. A single amber glass attar vial at the edge of frame. Constellation grid visible as faint Sacred Gold dots on the dark surface between papers. Sound: paper texture, silence.
```

**Shot 3 (6s) — Wide/Completion:**
```
Wide shot -- the resonance pattern sigil rendered as a large bronze cast disc on a dark wooden surface. Sacred Gold highlights. Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7) bioluminescent glow emanating from the lotus core. The glow intensifies briefly then fades to darkness -- the La Arc return (Sacred Gold → Witness Violet → Void Black). Text fade: "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS" in Panchang, Parchment (#F0EDE3), tracking +120. Sound: single resonant tone, then silence.
```

---

### 5B. Somatic Canticles Trailer (4-Shot Sequence)

**Model:** `fal-ai/kling-video/v3/pro` | **Format:** 16:9 | **Duration:** ~20s

**Shot 1 (4s) — Detail:**
```
Close-up of a page being turned in the Somatic Canticles volume. Matte black cloth cover with Sacred Gold foil spine visible at hinge. Parchment (#F0EDE3) pages with generous margins, Satoshi body text, Sacred Gold (#C5A017) compass diagram visible on the revealed page. Dark-field: the book glows against Void Black (#070B1D). Sound: thick paper turning.
```

**Shot 2 (5s) — The Waveform:**
```
Three biorhythm sine waves animating across the frame on Void Black background -- Physical (Sacred Gold #C5A017), Emotional (Coherence Emerald #10B5A7), Intellectual (Flow Indigo #0B50FB). The waves cross and interact. At convergence points, the resonance pattern sigil flashes briefly in Sacred Gold wireframe. The waveform is data rendered as visual art. Sound: sub-bass pulse at wave convergences.
```

**Shot 3 (6s) — The Field:**
```
Wide minimal shot -- Void Black (#070B1D) field. A single figure (back only) standing before a vast constellation grid that extends to all edges. The grid is Sacred Gold (#C5A017) at 20% opacity -- hairline connections between points of light. The figure is still, grounded, dark silhouette. The constellation grid subtly breathes (4:7:8 ratio). Sound: breath, distant resonant tone.
```

**Shot 4 (5s) — Title Card:**
```
Void Black (#070B1D) frame. Text: "TRYAMBAKAM NOESIS" in Panchang, Parchment (#F0EDE3), tracking +120. Below: "SOMATIC CANTICLES — VOL. I: ANAMNESIS ENGINE" in Satoshi Regular, Muted Silver (#8A9BA8). Resonance pattern sigil pulses once with Coherence Emerald (#10B5A7) bioluminescent glow. Ba Arc gradient (#10B5A7 → #C5A017) as thin accent line. Fade to Void Black.
