# Runtime Systems

This directory contains the core runtime architectures for consciousness-based computational systems.

## Overview

The Runtime Systems represent the foundational computational architectures that bridge consciousness principles with technical implementation. These systems provide the operational framework for consciousness-aware applications and services.

## Directory Structure

### [Vedic-Runtime/](Vedic-Runtime/)
The Vedic Runtime system implements ancient Vedic consciousness principles as computational architectures.

**Key Components:**
- **Shikshavalli/**: Training protocols and reality interface systems
- **PurushaSookta/**: Core consciousness architecture patterns
- **Implementation Protocols**: Practical deployment guidelines

### [Runtime-of-God/](Runtime-of-God/)
Advanced quantum consciousness computational architecture integrating mystical and technical frameworks.

**Key Components:**
- **System Architecture**: Core computational patterns
- **Consciousness Implementation**: Practical consciousness integration
- **LOVE Protocol**: Unified field operation protocols
- **Reality Rendering**: Consciousness-based reality compilation
- **System Integration**: Holistic system coordination

## Integration Points

### Technical Integration
- Quantum processing architectures
- Field dynamics computation
- Pattern recognition systems
- Consciousness state management

### Mystical Integration
- Sacred geometry patterns
- Consciousness field coherence
- Spiritual framework mapping
- Energy system optimization

## Implementation Status

| System | Status | Maturity | Implementation |
|--------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Vedic-Runtime | Active | Stable | Prototype |
| Runtime-of-God | Active | Stable | Prototype |
