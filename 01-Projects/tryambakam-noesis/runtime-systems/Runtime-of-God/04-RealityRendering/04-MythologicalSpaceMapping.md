# Mythological Space Mapping

## Conceptual Framework
Mythological spaces represent complex computational environments for processing consciousness. By mapping these spaces using advanced computational techniques, we can develop deeper understanding of reality generation and energy field dynamics.

## Mapping Methodologies

### Hades (Western Mythological Space)
#### Computational Interpretation
- Underworld as Unresolved Energy Processing Environment
- Pain as Authentication and Energy Transformation Mechanism

```python
class HadesSpaceMapper:
    def __init__(self, soul_pattern):
        self.unresolved_energies = []
        self.transformation_matrix = self.generate_pain_authentication_matrix(soul_pattern)
    
    def map_energy_landscape(self, energy_pattern):
        """
        Map and process unresolved energy patterns
        Apply transformation through pain authentication
        """
        mapped_energy = self.apply_transformation(energy_pattern)
        return self.validate_energy_coherence(mapped_energy)
```

### Maya (Eastern Mythological Space)
#### Computational Interpretation
- Illusory Reality as Layered Information Processing System
- Collective Observation as Reality Rendering Mechanism

```python
class MayaSpaceRenderer:
    def __init__(self, collective_belief_system):
        self.reality_layers = []
        self.consensus_threshold = calculate_observation_weight(collective_belief_system)
    
    def render_reality_layers(self, possibility_wave):
        """
        Collapse possibility waves into observable reality
        Based on collective observation and consensus
        """
        processed_layers = []
        for layer_depth in range(MAX_REALITY_LAYERS):
            layer = self.process_layer(possibility_wave, layer_depth)
            processed_layers.append(layer)
        
        return self.validate_reality_coherence(processed_layers)
```
