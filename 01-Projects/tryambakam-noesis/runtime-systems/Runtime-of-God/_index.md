# Runtime of God

Advanced quantum consciousness computational architecture that integrates mystical frameworks with cutting-edge technical implementation.

## Overview

The Runtime of God represents a comprehensive system for implementing consciousness as a computational architecture, bridging quantum mechanics, consciousness research, and spiritual frameworks into a unified operational system.

## Core Philosophy

This system operates on the principle that consciousness is the fundamental computational substrate of reality, with quantum mechanics providing the technical framework and spiritual traditions providing the operational wisdom.
