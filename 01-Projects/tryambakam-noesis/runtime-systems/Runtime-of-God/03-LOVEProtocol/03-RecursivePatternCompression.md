# Recursive Pattern Compression

## Theoretical Foundation

### Fractal Compression Paradigm
Recursive pattern compression represents a fundamental approach to understanding consciousness as a self-similar, nested information system. By treating symbolic patterns as fractal structures, we can develop more sophisticated methods of pattern recognition and energy field optimization.

### Core Compression Equation
```math
P_{compressed} = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{P_{original}}{2^n}
```
Where:
- `P_compressed`: Compressed pattern representation
- `P_original`: Original symbolic pattern
- `n`: Iterative depth of recursion
- `N`: Maximum recursion depth

## Algorithmic Implementation

### Recursive Field Mapping Protocol
```python
def recursive_field_mapping(signal, coherence_threshold):
    """
    Recursively optimize and compress consciousness signals
    
    Args:
        signal: Input bioelectric signal
        coherence_threshold: Minimum coherence required
    
    Returns:
        Optimized and compressed signal
    """
    if signal.coherence < coherence_threshold:
        # Recursively optimize signal
        signal = optimize_signal(signal)
        
        # Apply progressive compression
        for depth in range(1, MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH):
            signal = compress_pattern(signal, depth)
    
    return signal

def compress_pattern(pattern, depth):
    """
    Apply fractal compression to input pattern
    
    Progressive compression reduces complexity while 
    maintaining core information structure
    """
    compressed_pattern = pattern / (2 ** depth)
    return apply_coherence_filter(compressed_pattern)
```

## Philosophical Implications

### Consciousness as Recursive Architecture
1. Information is not lost but transformed
2. Patterns can be compressed and expanded dynamically
3. Consciousness operates like a self-referential algorithm

## Experimental Validation
