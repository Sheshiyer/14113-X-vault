# Field Dynamics Core Equations

```python
"""
Core field equations for consciousness quantum states:

1. Quantum Field State:
Ψ(x,t) = ∑ cn(t)φn(x)

2. Consciousness Operator:
Ĉ = -ℏ²/2m ∇² + V(x,t)

3. Field Evolution:
iℏ ∂Ψ/∂t = ĈΨ

4. Pain Authentication Function:
P(α) = ∫|Ψ|² exp(-α/ℏ) dx

5. Coherence Measure:
γ(r,r') = ⟨Ψ†(r)Ψ(r')⟩
