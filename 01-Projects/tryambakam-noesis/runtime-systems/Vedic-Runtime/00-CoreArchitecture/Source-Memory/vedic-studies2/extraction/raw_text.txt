Healing life not just the body
  Bio vedic flower remedies
Bio-Vedic Flower therapy is a
unique, no side-effects medicine
that rectifies the physiological
problems in the body by balancing
the life-force (prana sakthi) of the
person.
A Healthy body & mind is the normal state of
existence for all living beings.




All living organisms are inherently capable of healing
themselves from within.




      Immunity is the worlds best doctor
Disease is manifest
within the body due to
an imbalance, blockage
or disturbance in the flow
of the "Pranasakthi" of the
body.
Naadi Mandala / Pranayam
         Energy flow within human
         body


         through chakras and 72,000
         energy channels

         Pranasakthi once entering the
         body transforms to perform
         different funtions.
A very basic system of
the Naadi system with
18 major channels helped
shape acupuncture
         chakra system
At the heart of most eastern healing
systems.

7 Energy centres running from base
of spine to top of head.

Each chakra controls an emotion and
some bodily function.

Balance of energy in chakras
essential for health
The Chakras can be compared
to powerhouses which convert
the life force into different forms
before conducting it into the
respective naadis/channels.


They ensure proper
functionality of different parts of
the body and various aspects of
the soul by regulating and
modulating the Pranasakthi.
The Information about a
chakra and its functionality
has been encrypted in
symbolism and is shown to be
governed by a set of gods.


By studying the characters,
talents and powers of the
associated deity the
functionality of the chakra
and its use can be garnered.
