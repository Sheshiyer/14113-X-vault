  2.3 Clifford Algebras
  William Clifford invented his algebras in 1876 as an attempt to generalize the quaternions to higher dimensions,
  and he published a paper about them two years later [20]. Given a real inner product space , the Clifford
  algebra          is the associative algebra freely generated by modulo the relations




  for all           . Equivalently, it is the associative algebra freely generated by         modulo the relations




  for all               . If             with its usual inner product, we call this Clifford algebra          . Concretely, this is
  the associative algebra freely generated by                 anticommuting square roots of     . From this we easily see that




  So far this sequence resembles the iterated Cayley-Dickson construction -- but the octonions are not a Clifford
  algebra, since they are nonassociative. Nonetheless, there is a profound relation between Clifford algebras and
  normed division algebras. This relationship gives a nice way to prove that          and are the only normed
  dvivision algebras. It is also crucial for understanding the geometrical meaning of the octonions.

  To see this relation, ﬁrst suppose                 is a normed division algebra. Left multiplication by any element         gives
  an operator




  If            , the operator           is norm-preserving, so it maps the unit sphere of      to itself. Since   is a division
  algebra, we can ﬁnd an operator of this form mapping any point on the unit sphere to any other point. The only
  way the unit sphere in can have this much symmetry is if the norm on comes from an inner product. Even
  better, this inner product is unique, since we can use the polarization identity




  to recover it from the norm.

  Using this inner product, we say an element                     is imaginary if it is orthogonal to the element , and we let
             be the space of imaginary elements of            . We can also think of               as the tangent space of the unit
  sphere in         at the point . This has a nice consequence: since                        maps the unit sphere in       to the Lie
  group of orthogonal transformations of               , it must send           to the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint transformations
  of     . In short,         is skew-adjoint whenever         is imaginary.

  The relation to Clifford algebras shows up when we compute the square of                           for              . We can do this
  most easily when             has norm . Then         is both orthogonal and skew-adjoint. For any orthogonal
  transformation, we can ﬁnd some orthonormal basis in which its matrix is block diagonal, built from
  blocks that look like this:




  and possibly a               block like this:      . Such a transformation can only be skew-adjoint if it consists solely of
            blocks of this form:




  In this case, its square is             . We thus have            when                    has norm 1. It follows that




  for all                 . We thus obtain a representation of the Clifford algebra                            on    . Any -dimensional
  normed division algebra thus gives an              -dimensional representation of                         . As we shall see, this is very
  constraining.

  We have already described the Clifford algebras up to                       . Further calculations [50,73] give the following
  table, where we use                 to stand for         matrices with entries in the algebra         :

                                                         Table 2 — Clifford Algebras



  Starting at dimension 8, something marvelous happens: the table continues in the following fashion:




  In other words,                         consists of         matrices with entries in                   . This 'period-8' behavior was
  discovered by Cartan in 1908 [13], but we will take the liberty of calling it Bott periodicity, since it has a far-
  ranging set of applications to topology, some of which were discovered by Bott.

  Since Clifford algebras are built from matrix algebras over                          and       , it is easy to determine their
  representations. Every representation is a direct sum of irreducible ones, or irreps. The only irrep of                             is its
  obvious one via matrix multiplication on                 . Similarly, the only irrep of                is the obvious representation on
      , and the only irrep of                 is the obvious one on      .

  Glancing at the above table, we see that unless               equals         or     modulo ,                is a real, complex or
  quaternionic matrix algebra, so it has a unique irrep. For reasons to be explained later, this irrep is known as the
  space of pinors and denoted      . When is or modulo , the algebra                    is a direct sum of two real or
  quaternionic matrix algebras, so it has two irreps, which we call the positive pinors                             and negative pinors
       . We summarize these results in the following table:




                                                                      irreps of

11/7/2018                                                                     Clifford Algebras




                                                           Table 3 — Pinor Representations



  Examining this table, we see that in the range of dimensions listed there is an -dimensional representation of
             only for             and . What about higher dimensions? By Bott periodicity, the irreducible
  representations of                         are obtained by tensoring those of                   by      . This multiplies the dimension
  by 16, so one can easily check that for                       , the irreducible representations of                  always have
  dimension greater than .

  It follows that normed division algebras are only possible in dimensions                               and . Having constructed
             and      , we also know that normed division algebras exist in these dimensions. The only remaining
  question is whether they are unique. For this it helps to investigate more deeply the relation between normed
  division algebras and the Cayley-Dickson construction. In what follows, we outline an approach based on ideas
  in the book by Springer and Veldkamp [83].

  First, suppose is a normed division algebra. Then there is a unique linear operator      such that
  and          for        . With some calculation one can prove this makes into a nicely normed -algebra.

  Next, suppose that              is any subalgebra of the normed division algebra                 . It is easy to check that   is a nicely
  normed -algebra in its own right. If                      is not all of   , we can ﬁnd an element             that is orthogonal to every
  element of          . Without loss of generality we shall assume this element has norm 1. Since this element is
  orthogonal to                 , it is imaginary. From the deﬁnition of the               operator it follows that         , and from
  results earlier in this section we have                        . With further calculation one can show that for all                we
  have




  A glance at equation (1) reveals that these are exactly the relations deﬁning the Cayley-Dickson construction!
  With a little thought, it follows that the subalgebra of generated by       and is isomorphic as a -algebra to
      , the -algebra obtained from                    by the Cayley-Dickson construction.

  Thus, whenever we have a normed division algebra we can ﬁnd a chain of subalgebras
                             such that          . To construct  , we simply need to choose a norm-one
  element of          that is orthogonal to every element of                . It follows that the only normed division algebras of
  dimension 1, 2, 4 and 8 are                        and     . This also gives an alternate proof that there are no normed division
  algebras of other dimensions: if there were any, there would have to be a 16-dimensional one, namely                              — the
  sedenions. But as mentioned in Section 2.2, one can check explicitly that the sedenions are not a division
  algebra.
