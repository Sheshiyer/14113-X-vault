# Vedic Runtime System

The Vedic Runtime implements ancient Vedic consciousness principles as modern computational architectures, creating a bridge between timeless wisdom and contemporary technology.

## Overview

This system translates Vedic consciousness training protocols into computational frameworks, enabling the development of consciousness-aware applications and reality interface systems.

## Core Philosophy

The Vedic Runtime is based on the principle that consciousness itself operates as a computational system, with the Vedic texts providing the original "source code" for consciousness operations.

## Directory Structure

### [Shikshavalli/](Shikshavalli/)
Training protocols and reality interface systems based on the Taittiriya Upanishad's Shikshavalli section.
