# Enneagram Arrows - Integration and Disintegration Paths

## Overview

The arrows (or lines) connect each type to two other types, representing:
- **Integration Arrow:** Direction of growth and development (healthy stress)
- **Disintegration Arrow:** Direction of regression (unhealthy stress)

**Key Principle:** Movement along arrows is bidirectional - you can access high side of stress point or low side of growth point.

- Instead access Type 4's emotional awareness positively
- Use introspection without self-pity

## Witness Development Through Arrows

### Stage 1: Unconscious Movement
- Arrows happen automatically
- No awareness of pattern
- Complete identification

### Stage 2: Recognition
- "I notice I'm going to my stress point"
- Beginning awareness
- Can name the pattern

### Stage 3: Conscious Navigation
- "I choose to access my growth point"
- Intentional movement
- Using arrows as tools

### Stage 4: Freedom
- All points accessible
- No automatic reactivity
- Fluid presence

**Liberation:** From being moved by arrows → consciously using arrows → transcending the arrow system entirely while having full access to all qualities.
