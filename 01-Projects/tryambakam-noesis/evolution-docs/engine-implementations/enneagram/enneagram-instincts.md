# Enneagram Instinctual Variants - The Three Instincts

## Overview

The three instinctual variants (also called subtypes) represent basic survival drives that combine with the nine types to create 27 distinct expressions (9 types × 3 variants). These instincts are pre-Enneagram - they're biological drives present in all humans.

**Key Principle:** Your dominant instinct shapes how your type expresses itself in the world.

## Instinctual Stacking

Your **dominant** instinct - where your attention goes automatically. This is your default mode and primary concern.

### Secondary Instinct
Your **supporting** instinct - accessible but not automatic. You can use this when needed.

### Blind Spot
Your **repressed** instinct - least developed, creates vulnerability. This is where you're "blind."

### Stacking Notation

Six possible stackings:
1. **SP/SO** - Self-preservation dominant, Social secondary
2. **SP/SX** - Self-preservation dominant, Sexual secondary  
3. **SO/SP** - Social dominant, Self-preservation secondary
4. **SO/SX** - Social dominant, Sexual secondary
5. **SX/SP** - Sexual dominant, Self-preservation secondary
6. **SX/SO** - Sexual dominant, Social secondary

**Note:** The blind spot instinct is implied (whichever is missing).
