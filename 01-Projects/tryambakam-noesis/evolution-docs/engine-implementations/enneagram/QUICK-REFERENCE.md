score += 3 per fear match
score += 3 per desire match
confidence = max_score / total_score (capped at 0.8)

## The Essential Teaching

**The Enneagram is not a personality test.**  
**It's a liberation technology disguised as one.**

You think you're studying your type.  
You're actually creating space from it.

You think you're understanding yourself.  
You're actually dissolving the self.

**Use it until you don't need it.**
