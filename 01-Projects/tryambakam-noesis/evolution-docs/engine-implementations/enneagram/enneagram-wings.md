# Enneagram Wings - Adjacent Type Influences

## Overview

Wings are the types on either side of your core type that add flavor, nuance, and additional dimensions to the primary type pattern. Each type has two possible wings, and typically one is more dominant.

**Key Principle:** Wings modulate but don't change the core type. You remain your primary type with wing influence.

## Determining Your Wing

### Assessment Questions

1. **Between the two adjacent types, which do you relate to more?**
2. **Which wing's description resonates deeper?**
3. **In stress, do you move toward one wing more than the other?**
4. **Which wing's traits do others notice in you?**
5. **Which wing's growth path appeals to you?**

### Observational Clues

**Look for:**
- Behavioral patterns matching wing
- Energy style (introverted vs extroverted)
- Secondary motivations
- Stress responses
- Social style

### Balanced Wings

Some people have **balanced wings** - accessing both equally. This is less common but possible.

---

## Wing Development

### Conscious Wing Work

1. **Identify your dominant wing**
2. **Study the non-dominant wing**
3. **Consciously develop qualities from both**
4. **Notice which contexts activate which wing**
5. **Integrate both for wholeness**

### Wing Integration Process

```
Stage 1: Unconscious wing dominance
  ↓
Stage 2: Recognize wing patterns
  ↓
Stage 3: Consciously use both wings
  ↓
Stage 4: Full integration of wing qualities
```

## Wing vs. Arrow Confusion

### Wings (Adjacent Types)
- Constant influence
- Flavor and style
- Available always
- Modulate core type
- Example: 1w9 or 1w2

### Arrows (Lines)
- Stress and growth directions
- Temporary movements
- Situational
- Transform core type
- Example: 1→7 or 1→4

**Key Distinction:** Wings are "with you"; arrows are "where you go."

---

## Advanced Wing Theory

### Wing Strength Spectrum

```
Core Type ←→ Balanced ←→ Strong Wing
(wing barely present) | (both wings) | (wing very prominent)
```

### Context-Dependent Wings

Some practitioners observe:
- Work wing vs. home wing
- Public wing vs. private wing
- Stressed wing vs. relaxed wing

**Note:** This is debated in Enneagram circles.

---

## Wing Triads

### Center Combinations

**Body-Body Wings:**
- 8w9 or 9w8: Double body center
- 9w1 or 1w9: Double body center

**Heart-Heart Wings:**
- 2w3 or 3w2: Double heart center
- 3w4 or 4w3: Double heart center

**Head-Head Wings:**
- 5w6 or 6w5: Double head center
- 6w7 or 7w6: Double head center

**Cross-Center Wings:**
- 1w2 or 2w1: Body-Heart
- 4w5 or 5w4: Heart-Head
- 7w8 or 8w7: Head-Body

**Effect:** Same-center wings intensify center qualities; cross-center wings add balance.

---

## Witness Development Through Wings

### Identification with Wing
"I'm definitely a 1w2" - Fixed identity

### Recognizing Wing Patterns
"I notice my Two wing activating in relationships"

### Using Wings Consciously
"I'll access my Nine wing for this situation"

### Integration Beyond Wings
"All qualities available, no fixed wing identification"

**Liberation Path:** From being defined by wing → recognizing wing patterns → consciously using wings → freedom from wing fixation.
