## Quick Formula Reference

### Balance of First Mahadasha
```
completed_fraction = moon_degrees_in_nakshatra / 13.333°
remaining_years = full_mahadasha_period × (1 - completed_fraction)
```

**Example:**
- Moon at 8.5° in Ashwini (Ketu rules, 7-year period)
- Completed: 8.5 / 13.333 = 0.6375 (63.75%)
- Remaining: 7 × (1 - 0.6375) = 2.54 years

### Antardasha Duration
```
antardasha_duration = mahadasha_duration × (planet_period / 120)
```

**Example:**
- Venus Mahadasha = 20 years
- Sun Antardasha = 20 × (6 / 120) = 1.0 year

### Pratyantardasha Duration
```
pratyantardasha_duration = antardasha_duration × (planet_period / 120)
```

**Example:**
- Venus-Sun Antardasha = 1.0 year
- Venus-Sun-Moon Pratyantardasha = 1.0 × (10 / 120) = 0.0833 years = 30.4 days

### Years to Days
```
days = years × 365.25
```

### Days to Years
```
years = days / 365.25
```

## Common Calculations

### Find Your Starting Mahadasha
1. Calculate Moon's position at birth (sidereal)
2. Identify nakshatra (each is 13°20')
3. Lookup ruling planet of that nakshatra
4. This is your first Mahadasha planet

### Calculate Balance at Birth
1. Get degrees of Moon within nakshatra (0-13.333°)
2. Calculate: completed_fraction = degrees / 13.333
3. Get full period for your Mahadasha planet
4. Calculate: remaining = full_period × (1 - completed_fraction)

### Find Current Mahadasha
1. Calculate years since birth
2. Start with balance of first Mahadasha
3. Add subsequent complete periods until total exceeds years since birth
4. The last period added is current Mahadasha

### Find Current Antardasha
1. Know current Mahadasha and its start date
2. Generate Antardasha sequence for this Mahadasha
3. Calculate each Antardasha duration (proportional division)
4. Find which period contains current date

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't know my exact birth time?**
A: Vimshottari requires accurate birth time (within 2-4 minutes) because Moon moves ~1° per 2 hours. If unknown, birth chart rectification is needed.

**Q: Can Dasha predict specific events?**
A: Dasha describes themes and energies, not specific events. It's best used for understanding life phases and optimal timing for activities.

**Q: What if I'm between periods?**
A: Transition periods (last few days of one period, first few days of next) are powerful times for transformation. Prepare consciously.

**Q: Do all 9 planets affect everyone?**
A: Yes, everyone experiences all 9 Dashas in their sequence. Your birth nakshatra determines starting point and balance.

**Q: What about Western astrology?**
A: Vimshottari is part of Vedic (sidereal) astrology, which differs from Western (tropical) by ~24° due to precession of equinoxes.

**Q: Can I change my Dasha?**
A: The timeline is fixed at birth, but your response to periods is completely within your control. Consciousness work transforms experience.
