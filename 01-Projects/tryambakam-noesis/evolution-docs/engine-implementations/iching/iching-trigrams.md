# I-Ching Trigrams (Ba Gua) - Complete System

**Document Purpose:** Extract complete 8-trigram system with elements, attributes, family positions, directions, and correspondences

---

## Overview

The eight trigrams (Ba Gua 八卦) are the fundamental building blocks of the 64 hexagrams. Each trigram consists of three lines (solid yang or broken yin) and represents a fundamental force or principle in nature.

**Hexagram = Upper Trigram + Lower Trigram**
- **Upper Trigram:** Outer world, manifest reality, what others see
- **Lower Trigram:** Inner world, internal state, foundation

## Trigram Combinations in Hexagrams

### Upper Trigram (Outer World)
Shows how situation manifests externally, what others perceive, outer conditions

### Lower Trigram (Inner World)
Shows internal state, foundation, what's beneath the surface, personal condition

### Example: Hexagram 11 (Peace 泰)
- **Upper:** Earth (receptive, yielding)
- **Lower:** Heaven (creative, strong)
- **Meaning:** Earth above Heaven = receptive outer world, strong foundation = Peace, harmony
- Heaven's energy rises to meet Earth's receptivity

### Example: Hexagram 12 (Standstill 否)
- **Upper:** Heaven (creative, strong)
- **Lower:** Earth (receptive, yielding)
- **Meaning:** Heaven above Earth = they move apart = Standstill, obstruction
- Heaven rises, Earth sinks, no connection

---

## Trigram Interaction Dynamics

### Complementary Trigrams (Harmony)
- Same element trigrams (e.g., Thunder + Wind = both Wood)
- Father-Mother (Heaven + Earth)
- Supporting elements (e.g., Water + Wood = Water nourishes Wood)

### Conflicting Trigrams (Tension)
- Opposing elements (e.g., Water + Fire = conflict)
- Reversed family (e.g., Son over Father = inversion)
- Controlling cycle (Fire + Metal = Fire melts Metal)

### Generating Trigrams (Growth)
- Wood → Fire: Wind/Thunder feeds Fire
- Fire → Earth: Fire creates Earth (ash)
- Earth → Metal: Earth contains Metal
- Metal → Water: Metal collects Water (condensation)
- Water → Wood: Water nourishes Wood

### Controlling Trigrams (Restraint)
- Water controls Fire
- Fire controls Metal
- Metal controls Wood
- Wood controls Earth
- Earth controls Water

## Using Trigrams in Interpretation

### Step 1: Identify Upper and Lower Trigrams
Look up hexagram's trigram composition in hexagram data

### Step 2: Understand Elements in Play
- What elements are present?
- Are they harmonious or conflicting?
- What's the generative/controlling relationship?

### Step 3: Read Family Dynamics
- Who's on top, who's below?
- Father over Son? Daughter over Mother?
- What does this inversion/alignment mean?

### Step 4: Assess Movement
- How do the trigrams interact?
- Which direction is energy flowing?
- Is there harmony or tension?

### Step 5: Contextualize with Question
- How do trigram meanings apply to question asked?
- Inner trigram = internal state
- Outer trigram = external circumstances

## Trigram Nuclear/Hidden Trigrams

Some advanced I-Ching interpretations look at "nuclear trigrams" - hidden trigrams formed by lines 2-3-4 and 3-4-5 of the hexagram.

**Example: Hexagram with lines 123456**
- Nuclear Lower: Lines 2-3-4
- Nuclear Upper: Lines 3-4-5

These reveal hidden dynamics beneath the surface.

## Consciousness Development Through Trigrams

### Body/Mind/Spirit Alignment

**Body Trigrams (Instinct):**
- Earth: Physical nurturing
- Mountain: Physical stillness
- Thunder: Physical action

**Mind Trigrams (Emotion/Thought):**
- Water: Emotional depth
- Fire: Mental clarity
- Wind: Flexible thinking

**Spirit Trigrams (Transcendence):**

- Lake: Joyful expression

### Witness Practice
1. **Recognize** which trigram pattern is active in your experience
2. **Observe** the element's quality (solid, flowing, penetrating, etc.)
3. **Allow** the natural movement without resistance
4. **Witness** from the stillness of Mountain (internal) while allowing change

## Source Data Structure

```json
"trigrams": {
  "Heaven": {
    "chinese": "乾 (Qián)",
    "binary": "111",
    "element": "Metal",
    "attribute": "Strong",
    "family": "Father",
    "direction": "Northwest",
    "season": "Late Autumn",
    "meaning": "Creative force, strength, leadership"
  },

}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Trigram Lookup
```python
# Access trigram data from hexagram
upper_trigram_name = hexagram.trigrams[0]  # "Heaven"
lower_trigram_name = hexagram.trigrams[1]  # "Earth"

# Get full trigram data
upper_trigram = iching_data.trigrams[upper_trigram_name]
lower_trigram = iching_data.trigrams[lower_trigram_name]

# Access attributes
upper_element = upper_trigram["element"]  # "Metal"
lower_element = lower_trigram["element"]  # "Earth"
```

### Element Extraction
```python
trigram_elements = [
    self.iching_data.trigrams[primary_hexagram.trigrams[0]]["element"],
    self.iching_data.trigrams[primary_hexagram.trigrams[1]]["element"]
]
# Result: ["Metal", "Earth"]
```

## Advanced: Trigram Transformation Patterns

### When Trigrams Transform (Changing Lines)

If changing lines affect trigram composition, the hexagram can transform completely:

**Example:**
- **Original:** Thunder over Water (Hexagram 3)
- **Change Line 4:** Affects upper trigram
- **Mutation:** Mountain over Water (Hexagram 4)

The trigram shift reveals deeper transformation dynamics.

## Summary

- **8 Trigrams** = Building blocks of 64 hexagrams
- **3 Lines each** = Yin or Yang
- **Upper/Lower** = Outer world / Inner world
- **5 Elements** = Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water
- **Family** = Father, Mother, 3 Sons, 3 Daughters
- **Directions** = 8 compass points
- **Seasons** = Year cycle mapping

**Core Insight:** Hexagrams are conversations between two trigram forces - understanding trigrams is key to deep I-Ching interpretation.
