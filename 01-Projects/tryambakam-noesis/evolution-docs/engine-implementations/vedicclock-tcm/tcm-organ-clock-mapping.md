# TCM Organ Clock: 24-Hour Mapping

**Purpose:** Complete mapping of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Organ Clock with consciousness themes  
**Source:** `tcm_organ_clock.json` + `vedicclock_tcm.py`

---

## Overview

The TCM Organ Clock divides the 24-hour day into twelve 2-hour windows, each corresponding to a specific organ system. During each window, that organ's energy (Qi) is at its peak, making it the optimal time for related activities and consciousness work.

**Key Principle:** Each organ hour is not just biological—it carries a **consciousness theme**. The witness learns to observe which organ is "teaching" at any moment.

## Calculation Logic

**From:** `vedicclock_tcm.py`, lines 368-403

```python
def _calculate_tcm_organ_state(self, target_datetime: datetime) -> TCMOrganState:
    """Calculate current TCM Organ Clock state."""
    hour = target_datetime.hour
    
    # TCM Organ Clock (24-hour cycle, 2-hour windows)
    organ_schedule = {
        1: ("Liver", "Wood"), 3: ("Liver", "Wood"),
        5: ("Lung", "Metal"), 7: ("Large Intestine", "Metal"),
        9: ("Stomach", "Earth"), 11: ("Spleen", "Earth"),
        13: ("Heart", "Fire"), 15: ("Small Intestine", "Fire"),
        17: ("Bladder", "Water"), 19: ("Kidney", "Water"),
        21: ("Pericardium", "Fire"), 23: ("Triple Heater", "Fire")
    }
    
    # Find current organ based on hour
    current_hour_key = ((hour - 1) // 2) * 2 + 1
    if current_hour_key not in organ_schedule:
        current_hour_key = 1
    
    primary_organ, element = organ_schedule[current_hour_key]
    
    # Determine energy direction within 2-hour window
    hour_in_cycle = hour % 2
    energy_direction = "peak" if hour_in_cycle == 0 else "ascending"
    
    return TCMOrganState(
        primary_organ=primary_organ,
        secondary_organ=self._get_secondary_organ(primary_organ),
        element=element,
        energy_direction=energy_direction,
        optimal_activities=self._get_optimal_activities(primary_organ, energy_direction),
        avoid_activities=self._get_avoid_activities(primary_organ)
    )
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Get current hour (0-23)
2. Map to 2-hour organ window (odd hours mark window start)
3. Retrieve organ and element from schedule
4. Determine if hour is ascending (1st hour) or peak (2nd hour)
5. Return complete organ state with activities
