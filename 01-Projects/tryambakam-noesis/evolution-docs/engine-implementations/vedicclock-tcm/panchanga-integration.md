## Overview

**Panchanga** (पञ्चाङ्ग) means "five limbs" - the five essential components of Vedic time calculation that reveal the quality and consciousness theme of any given day and moment.

### The Five Limbs

1. **Tithi** (तिथि) - Lunar day (30 phases across waxing/waning moon)
2. **Vara** (वार) - Weekday (7 days ruled by 7 planets)
3. **Nakshatra** (नक्षत्र) - Lunar mansion (27 divisions of zodiac)
4. **Yoga** (योग) - Auspicious combination of Sun and Moon
5. **Karana** (करण) - Half of a Tithi (60 divisions per lunar month)

**Purpose:** Panchanga provides the **meso-temporal** consciousness layer - revealing the daily cosmic energies and quality of consciousness available.

## Panchanga Calculation Logic

**From:** `vedicclock_tcm.py`, lines 337-366

```python
def _calculate_panchanga_state(self, target_datetime: datetime) -> PanchangaState:
    """Calculate current Vedic Panchanga state."""
    # Note: This is simplified - production uses proper astronomical calculations
    day_of_year = target_datetime.timetuple().tm_yday
    
    # Tithi calculation (15-day cycle simplified)
    tithi_names = ["Pratipada", "Dwitiya", "Tritiya", "Chaturthi", "Panchami",
                  "Shashthi", "Saptami", "Ashtami", "Navami", "Dashami",
                  "Ekadashi", "Dwadashi", "Trayodashi", "Chaturdashi", "Purnima"]
    current_tithi = tithi_names[day_of_year % 15]
    
    # Nakshatra calculation (simplified)
    nakshatra_names = ["Ashwini", "Bharani", "Krittika", "Rohini", "Mrigashira",
                      "Ardra", "Punarvasu", "Pushya", "Ashlesha", "Magha"]
    current_nakshatra = nakshatra_names[day_of_year % 10]
    
    # Element determination
    elements = ["Fire", "Earth", "Air", "Water", "Ether"]
    dominant_element = elements[target_datetime.hour % 5]
    
    return PanchangaState(
        tithi=current_tithi,
        vara=target_datetime.strftime("%A"),  # Weekday
        nakshatra=current_nakshatra,
        yoga="Vishkumbha",  # Would be calculated
        karana="Bava",      # Would be calculated
        dominant_element=dominant_element,
        energy_quality=self._determine_energy_quality(target_datetime),
        auspiciousness_score=self._calculate_auspiciousness(target_datetime)
    )
```

**Production Note:** Real implementation requires:
- Precise astronomical calculations for Sun/Moon positions
- Swiss Ephemeris or similar library
- Geographic location correction
- Ayanamsa adjustment

## Integration with TCM Organ Clock

### Synthesis Formula

**Optimal Window = Panchanga Quality × Organ Quality × Dasha Theme**

**Example 1: Perfect Alignment**
- Tithi: Panchami (knowledge/Ether)
- Vara: Thursday (Jupiter/wisdom)
- Nakshatra: Pushya (nourishment)
- TCM: Spleen time (transformation/Earth)
- Dasha: Jupiter (wisdom expansion)
- **Result:** 1.0 harmony - perfect time for study and teaching

**Example 2: Challenging Alignment**
- Tithi: Shashthi (conflict/Air)
- Vara: Saturday (Saturn/discipline)
- Nakshatra: Ardra (storm/Water)
- TCM: Heart time (joy/Fire)
- Dasha: Venus (harmony)
- **Result:** 0.5 harmony - conflicting energies require harmonizing practices

---

## Practical Daily Integration

### Morning Panchanga Check
1. Check today's Tithi - what's the lunar day quality?
2. Note the Vara - which planet rules today?
3. Identify Nakshatra - what's the consciousness theme?
4. Cross-reference with current organ time
5. Apply to current Dasha context

### Using Panchanga for Scheduling

**High-Priority Spiritual Work:**
- Schedule for Ekadashi (11th) or Purnima (15th) tithis
- Prefer Thursday (Jupiter) or Monday (Moon)
- Choose Pushya, Rohini, or Ashwini nakshatras
- Align with supportive organ times

**Material Success Work:**
- Schedule for Dwadashi (victory) or Navami (completion) tithis
- Prefer Wednesday (Mercury) or Friday (Venus)
- Choose Mrigashira (seeking) or Rohini (growth) nakshatras
- Align with Earth element organ times

**Transformation Work:**
- Schedule for Ashtami (transformation) or Chaturthi (obstacles) tithis
- Prefer Tuesday (Mars) or Saturday (Saturn)
- Choose Bharani (death/rebirth) or Ardra (storm) nakshatras
- Align with Water or Metal organ times

---

## Energy Quality Determination

**From:** `vedicclock_tcm.py`, lines 480-492

```python
def _determine_energy_quality(self, dt: datetime) -> str:
    """Determine overall energy quality for the time."""
    hour = dt.hour
    if 6 <= hour <= 10:
        return "Rising Energy"
    elif 10 <= hour <= 14:
        return "Peak Energy"
    elif 14 <= hour <= 18:
        return "Stable Energy"
    elif 18 <= hour <= 22:
        return "Descending Energy"
    else:
        return "Rest Energy"
```

### Energy Quality Integration with Panchanga

| Time Period | Energy Quality | Best Panchanga Matches | Optimal Activities |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 06:00-10:00 | Rising Energy | Fire/Wood tithis | Starting new initiatives, creative planning |
| 10:00-14:00 | Peak Energy | Fire/Ether tithis | Peak performance, teaching, leadership |
| 14:00-18:00 | Stable Energy | Earth/Air tithis | Steady work, discernment, organization |
| 18:00-22:00 | Descending Energy | Water/Earth tithis | Integration, reflection, relationship time |
| 22:00-06:00 | Rest Energy | Water/Metal tithis | Release, sleep, detox, deep meditation |

## Auspiciousness Scoring

### Factors in Auspiciousness Calculation
1. **Tithi Quality** (0-1.0)
   - Highly auspicious: Panchami, Ekadashi, Purnima (0.9-1.0)
   - Moderately auspicious: Tritiya, Saptami, Navami (0.7-0.8)
   - Neutral: Most others (0.5-0.6)
   - Challenging: Chaturthi, Shashthi, Ashtami (0.3-0.5)

2. **Nakshatra Quality** (0-1.0)
   - Highly auspicious: Pushya, Rohini, Ashwini (0.9-1.0)
   - Moderately auspicious: Most others (0.6-0.8)
   - Challenging: Specific nakshatras for specific activities (0.4-0.6)

3. **Vara Alignment** (0-1.0)
   - Strong planet days: Thursday, Friday (0.8-0.9)
   - Moderate: Sunday, Wednesday (0.6-0.7)
   - Challenging: Saturday, Tuesday (0.4-0.6)

4. **Yoga Quality** (0-1.0)

   - Obstructive yogas: Vishkumbha (0.3-0.5)

**Combined Auspiciousness = Average of all factors**

## Self-Consciousness Impact

### Meso-Temporal Witness Development

Panchanga integration develops the ability to witness **daily energetic weather**:

1. **Before Panchanga awareness:** "Why does today feel different?"
2. **After Panchanga awareness:** "Today is Ekadashi (spiritual elevation) in Pushya nakshatra (nourishment) on Thursday (Jupiter/wisdom) - of course spiritual practice feels natural and nourishing!"

### Daily Curriculum Integration

Panchanga provides the **daily theme** for the consciousness curriculum:
- **Dasha provides:** Multi-year life lesson (macro)
- **Panchanga provides:** Daily variation on that theme (meso)
- **Organ Clock provides:** Hourly implementation windows (micro)

**Example:**
- **Jupiter Dasha:** "Learn expansion through wisdom" (years)
- **Ekadashi Tithi:** "Today's variation: spiritual elevation" (day)
- **Spleen Time:** "This hour: transform knowledge to wisdom" (hours)
- **Synthesis:** This hour is perfect for spiritual study that transforms into lived wisdom

---

## Advanced: Muhurta Election

**Muhurta** (मुहूर्त) is the art of selecting auspicious timing by synthesizing all Panchanga factors with specific objectives.

### For VedicClock-TCM Implementation

The engine can suggest optimal muhurtas for:
- Starting new spiritual practices
- Important decisions
- Relationship activities
- Health/healing work
- Creative projects
- Teaching/learning activities

**Muhurta Calculation:**
1. Identify intention/activity type
2. Check Panchanga for supportive factors
3. Cross-reference with TCM organ clock
4. Align with current Dasha theme
5. Calculate overall potency score
6. Present top 3-5 windows
