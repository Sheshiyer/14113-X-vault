## Calculation Logic

**From:** `vedicclock_tcm.py`, lines 405-438

```python
def _synthesize_elements(self, panchanga: PanchangaState, tcm: TCMOrganState) -> ElementalSynthesis:
    """Synthesize Vedic and TCM elemental energies."""
    
    # Element correspondence mapping
    vedic_tcm_harmony = {
        ("Fire", "Fire"): 1.0,    # Perfect resonance
        ("Fire", "Wood"): 0.8,    # Nourishing synergy
        ("Earth", "Earth"): 1.0,  # Perfect grounding
        ("Earth", "Metal"): 0.7,  # Supportive foundation
        ("Air", "Metal"): 0.9,    # Excellent refinement
        ("Water", "Water"): 1.0,  # Perfect flow
        ("Water", "Wood"): 0.8,   # Nourishing growth
        ("Ether", "Fire"): 0.9    # Transcendent joy
    }
    
    harmony_key = (panchanga.dominant_element, tcm.element)
    harmony_level = vedic_tcm_harmony.get(harmony_key, 0.6)  # Default 0.6 for unlisted combinations
    
    synthesis_qualities = {
        1.0: "Perfect Harmony",
        0.9: "Excellent Synergy",
        0.8: "Good Resonance",
        0.7: "Moderate Alignment",
        0.6: "Neutral Balance"
    }
    
    synthesis_quality = synthesis_qualities.get(harmony_level, "Requires Balancing")
    
    return ElementalSynthesis(
        vedic_element=panchanga.dominant_element,
        tcm_element=tcm.element,
        harmony_level=harmony_level,
        synthesis_quality=synthesis_quality,
        recommended_practices=self._get_harmonizing_practices(
            panchanga.dominant_element, tcm.element
        )
    )
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Receive Vedic element from Panchanga calculation
2. Receive TCM element from Organ Clock calculation
3. Look up harmony level in correspondence matrix
4. Assign quality descriptor based on harmony level
5. Retrieve element-specific practices
6. Return complete synthesis
