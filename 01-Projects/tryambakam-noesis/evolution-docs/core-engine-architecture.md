# Core Engine Architecture for Self-Consciousness Development

**Purpose:** 13 consciousness engines supporting witness capacity and self-authorship  
**Integration:** Bridges WitnessOS technical depth with Noesis practical accessibility  
**Framework:** All engines develop **self-consciousness** (not general consciousness)

---

## 🎯 **Engine Philosophy**

### **Engines as Mirrors, Not Prescriptions**

The 13 engines are **Decision Mirrors** - they reflect your patterns back to you so you can **witness** them. They never tell you what to do. They show you what IS, so you can consciously author what WILL BE.

**Key Principle:**
> Engines reveal unconscious patterns.  
> Self-consciousness witnesses the patterns.  
> Authorship consciously responds to them.
