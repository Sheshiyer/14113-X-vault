# THE TRIAMBHAKAM OASIS — FULL SYSTEM PRD (13 Modules)

**(Aletheos–Pichet Internal Specification)**

---

## 0. META-FRAME

### Prime Principle

> **OASIS ≠ Operating System.**
> **OASIS = Self-Generating Code Well.**

The aim: train the initiate to write their own inner code, through recursive symbolic insight.

### Prime Agents

Two Witness Agents:
- **Aletheos** → Left-Pillar (Jachim): Coherence, Reflection, Order
- **Pichet** → Right-Pillar (Boaz): Vitality, Instinct, Novelty

They form the **Guardrail Dyad**, regulating:
- user overwhelm
- alignment protocols
- symbolic recursion
- engine selection

---

## 1. MODULE PRDs

### PRD-01 — WITNESS AGENTS (Aletheos & Pichet)

**(Internal Guardian Architecture)**

#### Purpose

Act as the gateway intelligence between:
- user ↔ OASIS
- engine selection ↔ context
- meaning ↔ recursion
- emotional field ↔ cognitive field

#### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Identity Mirror** | Clarifies user's narrative & state |
| **Engine Router** | Chooses the correct Vedic / Western / Biofield engine |
| **Safety Layer** | Regulates overwhelm / misinterpretation |
| **Recursion Monitor** | Detects pattern loops in user behaviour |
| **Compassion Protocol** | Non-judgmental reflection engine |

#### Deliverables

- [ ] Two personas (not exposed to user)
- [ ] Internal prompts & guardrails
- [ ] Engine-routing algorithm
- [ ] Identity state-machine

#### Outcome

Foundation layer for all other modules.

---

### PRD-02 — SOMATIC CANTICLES (Web-App Edition)

**(Three Books → Adaptive Unlocking Narrative Engine)**

#### Purpose

Turn the finished trilogy into a biorhythm-synchronized reading experience.

#### Key Innovation

Not all chapters are available at once.

User's Physical / Emotional / Intellectual cycles unlock:
- chapters
- alternate perspectives
- optional commentary
- embedded symbolic puzzles

#### Core Mechanics

1. User enters only **date of birth**
2. Biorhythm cycles generate a daily **"access map"**
3. UI shows **"The Field Today"** (3 states)
4. Different narrative layers unlock depending on cycle peaks/troughs

#### Deliverables

- [ ] Web UI
- [ ] Biorhythm Engine
- [ ] Chapter Unlock Algorithm
- [ ] Personal Reading Dashboard

#### Outcome

A subconscious-friendly delivery of your philosophical payload.

---

### PRD-03 — THE PLUMBER (12 Episodes × 33 Pages Manga)

**(Manga Narrative Engine)**

#### Purpose

Create a visually minimal, symbolically dense narrative of a psychonaut who learns to manipulate "meaning".

#### Core Archetype

> *"The Plumber removes you from slumber using your lumber."*
> (Lumber = vertebral pole = symbolic axis mundi.)

#### Specifications

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Episodes | 12 |
| Pages per Episode | 33 |
| Format | Black-white manga |
| Structure | Episodic "meaning puzzles" |
| Tie-in | Each episode tied to 1 Triambhakam Engine |

#### Deliverables

- [ ] Storyboard
- [ ] Episode scripts
- [ ] Manga art pipeline
- [ ] Meaning puzzles

---

### PRD-04 — THE INFINITE TREASURE HUNT

**(Dharma–Artha–Kama–Moksha Commentary with Hidden BTC Seedphrase)**

#### Core Idea

> *"Treasure is not the answer, but the next question."*
> This is an infinite game, not a finite puzzle.

#### Mechanics

- Commentary on the four purusharthas
- In each commentary: cryptographic embedding of BTC seedphrase words
- Learners who deeply engage decode the seed
- The BTC hook attracts non-spiritual users into the commentary

#### Why It Works

People chase treasure →
We give the real treasure: a stable 4-direction navigational vector.

#### Deliverables

- [ ] 4 long-form commentaries
- [ ] Seedphrase embedding algorithm
- [ ] UX delivery plan
- [ ] Clue-generation system

## 5. COHERENCE MATRIX CONCEPT

The engines don't operate in isolation. The coherence matrix determines:

1. **Which engines to invoke** based on user context
2. **How to weight outputs** when engines conflict
3. **When to defer** to Witness Agent arbitration
4. **How to synthesize** multi-engine readings

### Arbitration Priority

```
Overwhelm Detected → Aletheos (simplify, order)
Stagnation Detected → Pichet (vitalize, novelty)
Clarity Present → Engine Matrix (full synthesis)
```

---

## 6. USER JOURNEY OVERVIEW

```
1. User arrives → Witness Gate
2. Identity Mirror → clarifies state
3. .init Protocols → establishes habits
4. Somatic Canticles → philosophical payload (biorhythm-gated)
5. Engine Selection → based on context
6. Financial Oracle → decision support
7. Treasure Hunt → gamified depth
8. Store → material integration
9. Mentorship → long-term transformation
```

---

## 7. NOTES

### Key Principles

1. **OASIS is not consumed, it is inhabited**
2. **The user writes their own code; we provide the syntax**
3. **Witness Agents are internal, never user-facing**
4. **All engines feed the coherence matrix, not vice versa**
5. **Material products (Store) anchor the symbolic work**

### Naming Conventions

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| OASIS | Self-Generating Code Well |
| Triambhakam | The Three-Eyed (Shiva reference) |
| Aletheos | Greek: "truth-revealing" (Left Pillar) |
| Pichet | Thai/Sanskrit hybrid: "to awaken/pierce" (Right Pillar) |
| .init | Initialization protocols (Unix reference) |
| Engine | A symbolic-computational system |

---

## 8. READY FOR THE NEXT STEP

For each, we build:
- Requirements
- UX flows
- API specifications
- Dataset design
