## Canonical Product Statement
Tryambakam Noesis website is a multi-dimensional ecosystem portal across digital infrastructure, symbolic media, physical ritual layers, initiation protocols, and mentorship pathways.

## Hard Constraints
- This project does **not** implement engine frontend calculators.
- Selemene engines are represented as references/handoffs to API/TUI/1319 surfaces.
- Website scope is orientation, integration, conversion, and ecosystem coherence.

## Canonical Layers (v1)
1. Selemene computational core (reference only)
2. Symbolic narratives (anime)
3. Physical ritual objects and Kopina bioelectric interfaces
4. Somatic Canticles
5. `.init` protocols
6. High-touch mentorship + astrocartography + PARA world
7. Financial biosensor decision-making

## Terminology Lock
- Use: ecosystem, initiation field, self-authorship, coherence, integration.
- Avoid: single-product framing, engine-only framing.
- Kopina language uses technical nomenclature (bioelectric, piezoelectric, circuitry, calibration).
