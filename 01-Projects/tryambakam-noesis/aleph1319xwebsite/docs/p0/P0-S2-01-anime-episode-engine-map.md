## Objective
Define the 12-episode symbolic narrative sequence and its engine lesson alignment.

## Episode Map
1. Panchanga -> time as cyclic
2. Vimshottari -> planetary periods as chapters
3. Human Design -> authority vs conditioning
4. Gene Keys -> shadow/gift/siddhi arc
5. Numerology -> number grammar
6. Biorhythm -> body as text
7. Vedic Clock -> organ wisdom
8. Biofield -> energy anatomy
9. Face Reading -> physiognomy map
10. Nadabrahman -> sound as structure
11. Transits -> movement as meaning
12. Synthesis -> witness emergence

## Unlock Logic (v1)
- Episode unlock can be conditioned by biorhythm state match.
- Fallback unlock path must exist for users without active compute session.

## Website Scope Note
Episodes are represented as narrative nodes and progression pathways only.
No engine calculators are embedded in episode surfaces.
