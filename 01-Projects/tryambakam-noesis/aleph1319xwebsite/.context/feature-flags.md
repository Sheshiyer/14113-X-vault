# Feature Flags

- `canvas_realtime_presence`
- `canvas_3d_media_nodes`
- `offer_donation_variant_b`
- `search_semantic_ranking`
- `narrative_gate_experiment`

Rules:
- Flags are environment-scoped.
- All new major features ship behind flags first.
- Kill-switch path required for any experimental runtime behavior.
