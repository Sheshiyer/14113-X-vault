# Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: graph transforms, canvas state reducers, API validators.
- Integration tests: API + DB + RLS + cache behavior.
- E2E tests: key flows on desktop/mobile, keyboard navigation, fallback mode.
- Visual regression: critical node cards and overlays.
- Performance checks: frame rate budget and bundle size thresholds.
- Accessibility checks: automated + manual keyboard/screen-reader passes.
