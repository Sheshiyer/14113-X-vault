# Product Workflows

1. Orientation flow: enter canvas -> visit 3 anchor clusters -> receive next-step CTA.
2. Ecosystem exploration flow: open layer node -> inspect references -> transition to related layer.
3. Access flow: complete orientation -> preview/DM/apply/product CTA.
4. Kopina flow: open technical integration node -> inspect mechanism -> join campaign/access route.
5. Admin publish flow: edit content -> preview -> publish -> realtime propagate.
6. Analytics flow: capture events -> aggregate dashboards -> weekly optimization review.

Constraint: engine computation interactions route to external Noesis surfaces; this project does not host engine calculators.
