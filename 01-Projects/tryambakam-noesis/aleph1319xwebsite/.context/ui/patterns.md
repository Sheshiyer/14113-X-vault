# UI Patterns

- Ecosystem Node Card: title, layer badge, thesis, action links.
- Deep Panel Overlay: focused reading layout with keyboard escape.
- Minimap + Compass: directional orientation and jump controls.
- Command Palette: jump-to-node and action shortcuts.
- Context Rail: visible breadcrumb of exploration path.
- Integration Link Card: explicit outbound handoff to Selemene/TUI/1319 surfaces.
- Accessibility fallback page: semantic, linear, no WebGL dependency.

Interaction conventions:
- Hover previews are optional; click/tap opens explicit view.
- Keyboard parity for all pointer interactions.
- Motion uses subtle inertial transitions; no decorative jitter.
- Do not render engine calculator forms/components in this project.
