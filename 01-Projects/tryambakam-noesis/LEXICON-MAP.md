### SECTION 3: TRANSFORM (Replace with Function-Descriptive Terms)

These are pure tradition-labels. The new terms describe what the engine DOES, not where it came from.

| Old Term | Source Tradition | New Term | Definition | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Vedic Clock** | Ayurvedic/TCM | **Circadian Cartography** | Maps organ activation rhythms to time-of-day | "Vedic" is tradition-label; "Circadian Cartography" describes the function using brand vocabulary |
| **Chakra** | Sanskrit/Tantric | **Biofield Locus** | Energy center in the bioelectric body map | "Chakra" carries spiritual baggage; "Biofield Locus" is precise and scientific |
| **Kosha** | Sanskrit/Vedic | **Field Layer** | Subtle energy sheath; one layer of manifest embodiment | "Field Layer" is immediately comprehensible |
| **Chakra-Kosha (combined)** | Sanskrit | **Biofield Cartography** | Full mapping of energy centers and layers in the subtle body | Combines both concepts into one functional descriptor |
| **Biorhythm** | Western pseudoscience | **Three-Wave Cycle** | Physical/Emotional/Intellectual sine-wave mapping | "Three-Wave" describes the actual structure |
| **Sacred Geometry** | Hermetic/Platonic | **Geometric Resonance** | Mathematical symmetries found in nature and consciousness | Removes "Sacred" (tradition-label), keeps the function |
| **Tarot** | European Occult | **Archetypal Mirror** | 78-card symbolic reflection system for current state | "Mirror" aligns with brand vocabulary (Decision Mirrors) |
| **I Ching** | Chinese Philosophy | **Hexagram Navigation** | 64-state pattern recognition oracle system | Describes what it does, not where it's from |
| **Human Design** | Western Synthesis | **Energetic Authority** | Type + authority system for decision-making architecture | "Authority" is the key concept; "Human Design" is brand name of source |
| **Gene Keys** | Western/Vedic hybrid | **Gift-Shadow Spectrum** | Shadow-Gift-Siddhi developmental activation arc | Describes the actual process: moving from shadow to gift |
| **Numerology** | Pythagorean/Kabbalistic | **Numeric Architecture** | Archetypal number patterns encoded in birth data | Function-descriptive; removes tradition association |
| **Enneagram** | Greek/Christian Mystical | **Nine-Point Architecture** | 9-type personality system with integration/disintegration paths | Describes the structure directly |
| **Face Reading** | Chinese/Vedic | **Physiognomic Mapping** | Facial feature correlation to organ health and life patterns | Clinical and precise |
| **Transits** | Astrological | **Active Planetary Weather** | Current planetary positions relative to natal chart | Meteorological metaphor; immediately intuitive |
| **Mudra** | Sanskrit/Yogic | **Embodied Gesture** | Symbolic hand/body position anchoring practice | English; describes what you DO |
| **Mantra** | Sanskrit/Vedic | **Resonance Phrase** | Repeated sound pattern for coherence attunement | Function-descriptive |
| **Guru** | Sanskrit/Hindu | **Cartographer** (our alternative) | Guide who maps terrain but doesn't walk your path | Brand-aligned; explicitly anti-guru |
| **Astrology (general)** | Hellenistic/Vedic | **Planetary Timing** | Observation of celestial cycles and their correlation to timing | Removes divination connotation |
| **Biofield (vague)** | Western Energy Medicine | **Bioelectric Field** | Measurable electromagnetic and subtle energy patterns in the body | More precise; adds "electric" for scientific grounding |

### SECTION 6: USAGE GUIDELINES

**In Public-Facing Copy (website, X, marketing):**
- Use TRANSFORM terms exclusively (Chronofield, not Vimshottari)
- Use BRIDGE terms with translations on first mention: "Purushartha (The Four Vectors)"
- Never use raw Sanskrit without a parenthetical English translation

**In Technical Documentation (internal, developer-facing):**
- Use TRANSFORM terms as primary, original terms in parentheses for cross-reference
- Example: "The Chronofield engine (formerly Vimshottari Dasha) calculates..."

**In Narrative Content (Somatic Canticles, The Plumber):**
- May use Neo-Sanskrit hybrid terms for atmospheric effect
- Always provide context through narrative so meaning is clear without glossary

**In Expert/Mentorship Materials:**
- Full dual-layer: both original and brand-native terms presented together
- "For those familiar with Vedic systems, Chronofield implements the Vimshottari Dasha cycle"
