Hourly Quantum Breath Check — Waning phase.

This hour chooses Octave 8: Balance and Grounding.

Sit. Feel your weight drop into the seat. Unclench the jaw. Let the shoulders fall.

Breath count: 8.
Inhale for 4… hold for 2… exhale for 6.
Do that for eight rounds.

On the final exhale, ask the Generator Sacral:
“Am I in response, or forcing?”
Then wait in the body. Listen for the clean uh-huh… or the clean uh-uh.

If it’s uh-huh: take one small responsive action in the next 10 minutes.
If it’s uh-uh: reduce scope. One grounding act only — water, food, or a 2-minute walk.

Return to stillness. Integration over intensity.
