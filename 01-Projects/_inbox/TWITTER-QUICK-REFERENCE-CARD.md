## YOUR POSITIONING (1 sentence)
Consciousness Debugger: Help people rewrite legacy code (patterns) through 1:1 coaching.

---

## YOUR VOICE (4 words)
Grounded. Direct. Respectful-Challenging. Technical.

---

## YOUR UNIQUE ANGLE
Bridge technical metaphors (debugging, OS, legacy code) with spiritual frameworks (consciousness, patterns, transformation) — NOT generic self-help.

---

## WORD BANK (USE THESE)

✅ **Debugging, pattern, OS, legacy code, authorship, coherence, inhabit, capacity, protocol, architecture, recursive, witness, examination, cultivation**

---

## WORD BANK (AVOID THESE)

❌ **Journey, healing, manifesting, vibration, authentic self, optimization, hacks, spiritual bypass, tribe, wellness**

---

## POSTING FORMULA

**The Grounded Opening:**
1. Name a specific problem people have
2. Reframe it as a pattern/code/system issue
3. Offer the debugging move
4. End with a question (invites replies)

**Example:**
"You've tried 47 productivity systems. They all fail.
Why? Your Human Design profile might explain why.
Not a limitation. An OS constraint.
Which authority type resonates with you?"

---

## ENGAGEMENT CTA OPTIONS

**Soft (builds relationship):**
- "What pattern resonates with you?"
- "Which script are you still running?"
- "What would you rewrite?"

**Medium (soft sell):**
- "I work 1:1 on this"
- "That's where consciousness debugging comes in"
- "If that's you, we should talk"

**Hard (only after rapport):**
- "DM if you want to explore deeper"
- "Open to a conversation? Slide in my DMs"

## PRE-POST CHECKLIST (30 seconds)

- [ ] Naming a specific pattern? (not abstract)
- [ ] Using technical metaphor? (code, debugging, OS, protocol)
- [ ] Direct language? (no hedging)
- [ ] Assumes reader is capable? (not coddling)
- [ ] Ends with question or point? (no hype)
- [ ] No exclamation marks? (only if rare + earned)

---

## IF YOU GET STUCK

**Stuck on topic?** Use these frameworks:
- Consciousness as an operating system that runs code
- Patterns as inherited/legacy protocols
- Debugging as the practice of examining how you think
- Human Design as an OS manual for how you make decisions
- Sacred geometry/numerology as algorithmic patterns in reality

**Stuck on tone?** Read the **Voice & Tone Guide** (`03-voice-and-tone.md`)

**Stuck on direction?** Return to this: You help people recognize they're running old code, then debug/rewrite it. 1:1 coaching is the vehicle.

## THIS WEEK'S POSTS

**Mon:** "Your consciousness isn't broken. Your OS is running legacy code."
**Tue:** "Why your manifestation scripts crash" (thread)
**Wed:** "If you've tried 47 productivity systems" (thread on Human Design)
**Thu:** "Most consciousness debugging is solo work" (consulting tease)

---

## MEASURE SUCCESS BY

1. **Replies** > Likes (conversation signal > vanity metric)
2. **Thoughtful questions** in replies (not just emojis)
3. **DM inquiries** about coaching (actual business signal)
4. **Which post type** gets most replies? (tells you what resonates)

---

## IF YOU GET A REPLY

**Do:**
- Answer thoughtfully (2-3 sentences max)
- Use their language back to them
- Ask a follow-up that continues inquiry
- If relevant: mention "I work 1:1 on this" naturally

**Don't:**
- Write a novel in reply (keep threads compact)
- Self-promote hard
- Dismiss their experience
- Pretend to have all answers

**Example reply:**
```
Them: "I've tried meditation but can't stick with it."

You: "The insight-action gap. You know the practice works, but your OS resists engaging. What's the resistance? Fear? Boredom? Unfamiliar sensation?"
```

---

## EMERGENCY CONTENT (If stuck)

If you can't think of a post, ask these questions & share the answer:

- "What pattern do I keep seeing people running?"
- "What's one mistake I used to make that I don't anymore?"
- "What's a hard truth people don't want to hear?"
- "What does my Human Design profile tell me about how I work?"
- "What's a reframe that changed my life?"

Answer → Post. Simple.

## KEEP THESE OPEN WHILE WORKING

1. **WEEK-1-TWITTER-LAUNCH-PACKET.md** (your posts + timing)
2. **03-voice-and-tone.md** (your voice reference)
3. **Google Sheet** (tracking engagement)
4. **This card** (quick checks)
