## 🧠 Type 5→8 Integration Insight

**Pattern Detected**: 20+ MCP/tool ideas in Triage = Type 5→7 stress (accumulation)

**Integration Move**: Pick ONE MCP tool and BUILD IT this month:
- Recommended: **Notion MCP** (highest utility for vault workflow)
- Or: **Obsidian MCP** (directly serves vault operations)

The goal isn't to build all 8 MCP tools — it's to create ONE working thing from accumulated knowledge.
