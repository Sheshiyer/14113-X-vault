# CONTEXT.md - Thoughtseed

## 🎯 Purpose (Artha)
**Triage Category:** **Occupation** (The Vehicle)
**Vision:** Navigating the "Digital Wilderness." Building the substrate for high-density thought cultivation and distribution. **Thoughtseed** is the material container that enables the expression of the **Vocations**.

## 🏗️ Technical Stack (Annamaya)
*   **Infrastructure:** (To be defined - likely involves the Witness OS / OpenClaw infrastructure as the 'brains').
*   **Presence:** [thoughtseed.space](https://www.thoughtseed.space/)

## 🌊 Current State (Pranamaya)
*   Active development of the "Digital Wilderness" ecosystem.
*   Integration point for all Vocations (Tryambakam Noesis, Somatic Canticles, RealityWraps).

## 🧠 Strategic Vision (Manomaya)
*   **The "Vocation vs. Occupation" Distinction:** Thoughtseed is the structural vehicle (Occupation) that houses and sustains the creative/spiritual inquiries (Vocations).
*   **5D Thinking Alignment:** Tapping into the 5th dimension (Time) by planting "seeds" that evolve into complex intellectual ecosystems.

## 🚨 Never Forget
*   Maintain the boundary between Vocation (The Work) and Occupation (The Vehicle).
*   The Digital Wilderness is inhabited, not just managed.
