# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### TTS - ElevenLabs Configuration
- API Key: PLACEHOLDER (Replace this with actual key)
- Default Voice: "Rachel"
- Endpoint: https://api.elevenlabs.io
```
