# PROJECT MEMORY

## Overview
`Somatic Canticles` is a science fiction trilogy about a team of "Somanauts" who navigate inner space to debug and heal consciousness. The project uses a unique "PubMed x Alex Grey" aesthetic, blending hard science with visionary, mystical prose. The core narrative follows the team as they rediscover and apply the "Tryambakam Protocol," a technology of consciousness liberation derived from an ancient Sanskrit mantra, to help individuals and collectives achieve a state of `Aletheia` (unconcealment) by freeing themselves from the "Vine of Determinism."

## Completed Tasks
## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Outline Book 3: The Ripening
- **Outcome**: A new detailed, chapter-by-chapter plot outline for Book 3 has been created.
- **Breakthrough**: This outline provides a satisfying and thematically coherent conclusion to the entire trilogy. It defines the nature of the final antagonist (the "Gardener"), outlines the ultimate goal (the "Severance Event"), and charts the final, most challenging phases of the team's character arcs. It successfully brings all the core concepts—`Aletheia`, `Khalorēē`, the `Vine of Determinism`—to a powerful and definitive conclusion.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**:
  - Created file: `Somatic-Canticles/02_MANUSCRIPTS/BOOK_3_THE_RIPENING/00_PLANNING/DETAILED_PLOT_OUTLINE.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: All planned tasks are now complete. The project is in a fully-planned, well-documented, and robust state, ready for the next phase of detailed writing.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Outline Book 2: The Myocardial Chorus
- **Outcome**: A new detailed, chapter-by-chapter plot outline for Book 2 has been created.
- **Breakthrough**: This outline provides a solid narrative structure for the sequel. It effectively raises the stakes from an individual to a collective trauma, introduces compelling new concepts like the "Myocardial Chorus" and "Scar Tissue Sonnets," and charts a clear arc for the team's failure, growth, and ultimate success. It also clearly sets up the antagonist for the final book.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**:
  - Created file: `Somatic-Canticles/02_MANUSCRIPTS/BOOK_2_THE_MYOCARDIAL_CHORUS/00_PLANNING/DETAILED_PLOT_OUTLINE.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: The planning for Book 2 is complete. The next and final planning step is to create a similar detailed outline for Book 3, `The Ripening`, to ensure the entire trilogy has a coherent, fully-planned narrative arc from start to finish.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Define Key Concepts
- **Outcome**: A new `KEY-CONCEPTS.md` document has been created in the world bible.
- **Breakthrough**: This task formally defined the `Soma Vector` and `Triangulation Engine`. Providing detailed, in-universe definitions and analogies for these core technologies makes the world feel more concrete and the Somanauts' actions more understandable and consistent. It solidifies the "how" behind their complex work.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**:
  - Created file: `Somatic-Canticles/01_WORLD_BIBLE/KEY-CONCEPTS.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: With the core concepts of Book 1's technology now fully defined, the foundational work for the first novel is largely complete. The next logical step is to begin high-level planning for the sequel, `The Myocardial Chorus`, to ensure the events of Book 1 are properly setting up the future narrative.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Define Key Tech: Anamnesis Engine
- **Outcome**: A new technical specification document for the `Anamnesis Engine` has been created.
- **Breakthrough**: This document solidifies the core mechanics of the Somanauts' technology. It defines the Engine's philosophy and breaks it down into understandable components (Soma Vector Probe, Glypt Rendering Core, Triangulation Engine). Crucially, it links each character's unique `Prana` to a specific UI/UX overlay, making their roles within the Engine concrete and distinct.
- **Errors Fixed**: Corrected an initial error where the file was created in a non-existent directory.
- **Code Changes**:
  - Created file: `Somatic-Canticles/01_WORLD_BIBLE/ANAMNESIS-ENGINE-SPECS.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: While the `Anamnesis Engine` document provides an overview of the `Soma Vector` and `Triangulation Engine`, these core concepts are complex enough to warrant their own dedicated entries. The next task will be to create a formal definitions document for these terms.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Flesh out character profiles
- **Outcome**: The primary character profile document has been updated for all four main characters.
- **Breakthrough**: Each character now has an assigned Enneagram type with a description of its manifestation, and a specific "Biological Challenge" that links their psychological weaknesses to a tangible, physiological condition. This provides deeper, more integrated characterization and creates new avenues for conflict and personal stakes during missions.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**:
  - Modified file: `Somatic-Canticles/01_WORLD_BIBLE/CHARACTER_SYSTEM/CHARACTER-KHALOREE-PROFILES.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: With the characters now more deeply defined, the next logical step is to define the core technology they use. Detailing the `Anamnesis Engine` will clarify the "how" of their operations and provide a concrete framework for the technical aspects of their missions.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Refine written chapters
- **Outcome**: A full refinement pass has been completed on Chapters 1-7.
- **Breakthrough**: This pass successfully integrated core lore concepts (`Aletheia`, `Lethe`, `Vine of Determinism`, `Soma Vector`, `Coherence Cultivation`, `Tryambakam Protocol`) into the existing narrative. The `Prana` and specific abilities of each character (Jian's equations, Corv's mythic architecture, Gideon's kinetic integrity) were also clarified and made consistent. This ensures the foundational chapters of the book are now in full alignment with the worldbuilding and philosophical core of the series.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**:
  - Modified file: `Somatic-Canticles/.../Chapter-01-The-Choroid-Plexus.md`
  - Modified file: `Somatic-Canticles/.../Chapter-02-Signal-Transduction.md`
  - Modified file: `Somatic-Canticles/.../Chapter-03-The-Blood-Brain-Barrier.md`
  - Modified file: `Somatic-Canticles/.../Chapter-04-The-Emperors-Genome.md`
  - Modified file: `Somatic-Canticles/.../Chapter-05-The-Endocrine-Dogma.md`
  - Modified file: `Somatic-Canticles/.../Chapter-06-The-Synaptic-Crossroads.md`
  - Modified file: `Somatic-Canticles/.../Chapter-07-The-Vagus-Nerve-Superhighway.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: With the initial chapters drafted and refined, the next logical step is to deepen the characters themselves. Fleshing out their profiles will provide the necessary depth for their interactions and decisions in the next block of chapters.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Write Chapter 7: The Vagus Nerve Superhighway
- **Outcome**: A full first draft of Chapter 7 has been written and saved to the manuscript directory. This completes the initial drafting for Part 2 of Book 1.
- **Breakthrough**: This chapter showcases the team's newfound cohesion under pressure and solidifies Gideon's role as the "Chariot"—the master of controlled force and willpower. It translates a complex biological journey into a high-stakes action sequence, demonstrating the "PubMed x Alex Grey" style guide in motion.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**:
  - Created file: `Somatic-Canticles/02_MANUSCRIPTS/BOOK_1_ANAMNESIS_ENGINE/01_DRAFTS/Chapter-07-The-Vagus-Nerve-Superhighway.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: The completion of this chapter block makes the next logical step a "Refinement Pass." Now that the narrative sequence is established, the earlier chapters can be updated to seamlessly foreshadow the technology, character abilities, and philosophical concepts (like the Soma Vector and Tryambakam Protocol) that were developed during the writing process.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Write Chapter 6: The Synaptic Crossroads
- **Outcome**: A full first draft of Chapter 6 has been written and saved to the manuscript directory.
- **Breakthrough**: This chapter serves as the crucial turning point for the team's internal dynamics. It dramatizes the core conflict between logic (Jian) and intuition (Sona) and resolves it through the "Lovers" archetype—a synthesis of opposites based on earned trust. This act of achieving internal `Coherence Cultivation` within the team is what allows them to proceed on the more dangerous but more truthful path.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**:
  - Created file: `Somatic-Canticles/02_MANUSCRIPTS/BOOK_1_ANAMNESIS_ENGINE/01_DRAFTS/Chapter-06-The-Synaptic-Crossroads.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: Having chosen the path of emotion, the team must now commit to it. This choice leads them directly to the "Vagus Nerve Superhighway" in Chapter 7, a high-speed, dangerous journey that will test the control and willpower of the newly unified team.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Write Chapter 5: The Endocrine Dogma
- **Outcome**: A full first draft of Chapter 5 has been written and saved to the manuscript directory.
- **Breakthrough**: This chapter establishes the concept of "somatic dogma," where an ancient trauma response has become a ritualized, unquestioned belief system within the body. It shifts the focus from a specific genetic marker (Chapter 4) to the active, systemic expression of that code via the endocrine system. Corv's role as the "Hierophant" who can interpret and challenge these deep-seated traditions is solidified.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**: 
  - Created file: `Somatic-Canticles/02_MANUSCRIPTS/BOOK_1_ANAMNESIS_ENGINE/01_DRAFTS/Chapter-05-The-Endocrine-Dogma.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: Questioning the dogma creates a "schism" in the subject's reality-processing, forcing a confrontation between two opposing belief systems. This directly leads the team to the "Synaptic Crossroads" in Chapter 6, where a choice between these two paths must be made.

## [2025-06-30] Task Completed: Write Chapter 4: The Emperor's Genome
- **Outcome**: A full first draft of Chapter 4 has been written and saved to the manuscript directory.
- **Breakthrough**: This chapter solidifies Jian Li's role as "The Emperor," the agent of structure. It establishes a critical link between a psychic clue (a scent) and a physical, biological reality (an epigenetic lock). This moves the investigation from the abstract mind to the concrete genome.
- **Errors Fixed**: N/A.
- **Code Changes**: 
  - Created file: `Somatic-Canticles/02_MANUSCRIPTS/BOOK_1_ANAMNESIS_ENGINE/01_DRAFTS/Chapter-04-The-Emperors-Genome.md`
- **Next Dependencies**: The discovery of the epigenetic lock provides the necessary clue to investigate the endocrine system in Chapter 5, as the lock's existence points to a higher-level regulatory system enforcing the "dogma."
