- The Landing Page: You're greeted by a pixelated version of the Eye of Horus, but it's also the logo for an NFT collection. The eye blinks, and suddenly, you're in.
    
- The Cosmic Scroll: Instead of a menu, you've got a scroll that looks like it was pulled straight from the library of Alexandria, but it's interactive. Click on "Mystical NFTs," and you're teleported to a gallery where each piece is a digital relic of consciousness.
    
- The Enlightenment Button: There's this button that says "Enlighten Me." Press it, and you're bombarded with a flurry of tweets from @mrhigh3r, each one a mini-awakening, blending quantum physics with Vedic texts like it's normal.
    
- The Meme Matrix: A section where memes about blockchain meet ancient gods. There's one with Ganesha holding a Bitcoin, captioned "Remove obstacles from your crypto path."
    
- The Time Warp: A feature where you input your birth date, and it calculates your "Kali Yuga Score" - how enlightened you are in the current age, but with a twist of humor and a dash of NFT promotion.
    
- The Oracle's Corner: A live chat where you're not talking to @mrhigh3r but an AI that's been trained on his tweets, giving you advice that's part tech support, part spiritual guidance.
    
- The Exit Sign: But wait, there's no exit. Instead, there's an "Awaken Elsewhere" button that sends you into another dimension of the web, but not before you're hit with a final tweet from @mrhigh3r, "You can leave, but the truth stays with you."
