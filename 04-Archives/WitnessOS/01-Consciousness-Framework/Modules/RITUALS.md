# RITUALS.md — Micro-Ritual Protocols & Reality Patch Engine
*Vault-Integrated Character Healing & Three-Brain Debugging System*

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

In WitnessOS, **rituals** are not merely habits.
They are **symbolic patches** injected consciously into the runtime to stabilize, upgrade, or mutate fields.

The **Reality Patch Engine** houses these modular micro-rituals, allowing users to install subtle yet powerful corrections into their breathfield, energy stack, and attention loops while supporting Three-Body-Kingdom character development and treasure hunt progression.

Rituals here are:
- Modular and stackable for complex character healing
- Breath-linked for three-brain coordination
- Symbolically encoded with Bitcoin cipher elements
- Lightweight (2–12 minutes max unless specified)
- Integrated with consciousness development metrics

### **🎮 Three-Body-Kingdom Integration**
*Rituals serve as character healing and debugging protocols, where micro-ritual mastery unlocks advanced gameplay mechanics and consciousness development progression.*

## 🧩 2. What is a Reality Patch?

| Aspect | Definition | Three-Brain Application | Game Integration |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Micro-ritual** | A symbolic + energetic insert into the active daily field | Coordinates reptilian, limbic, neocortical responses | Character healing and status restoration |
| **Energetic Debugger** | Corrects small distortions before they grow into entropic loops | Prevents three-brain system conflicts | Character flaw resolution and optimization |
| **Attention Refiner** | Tunes emotional, cognitive, and psychic attention vectors | Enhances three-brain integration and coordination | Character focus and awareness enhancement |
| **Prana Conservator** | Repairs breathfield leaks or drains caused by unconscious field drift | Optimizes energy flow across all brain systems | Character energy management and restoration |

Reality Patches are applied during:
- Emotional turbulence (limbic system debugging)
- Field drift (overwhelm, distraction, apathy - neocortical optimization)
- Survival stress (reptilian brain stabilization)
- Intentional upgrades (creating new archetypal pathways)
- Character development challenges and treasure hunt progression
