# GLOSSARY.md — WitnessOS Archetypal Reference & Metaphor Decoder
*Vault-Integrated Consciousness Lexicon & Game Resource Dictionary*

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

The **WitnessOS Archetypal Glossary** serves as the *primary symbolic decoding table* for all major metaphors, terms, archetypes, and consciousness modules used throughout the system.

Unlike ordinary glossaries, this is a **living archetypal reference** that breathes with meaning:
- Each term connects to a **pranic function** (energy work)
- A **symbolic layer** (mythic or archetypal role)
- An **operational layer** (how it integrates into daily consciousness debugging)
- A **field resonance** (how it connects to other WitnessOS concepts)
- A **game integration** (Three-Body-Kingdom treasure hunt applications)

**This glossary is the archetypal decoder** for the entire WitnessOS consciousness architecture and game resource system.

### **🎮 Three-Body-Kingdom Integration**
*Each term serves dual purpose: consciousness development and treasure hunt mechanics, where understanding definitions unlocks cipher components and vault access.*
