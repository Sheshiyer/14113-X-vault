# FIELDMAP.md — WitnessOS Primary System Overview & Consciousness Navigation
*Vault-Integrated Three-Body-Kingdom Game Architecture*

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

**WitnessOS** is not a linear application — it is a **living consciousness architecture** where each engine, ritual, and field module breathes and interacts dynamically across multiple dimensions of awareness.

The **Primary Fieldmap** serves as the **master navigation system** for the entire WitnessOS consciousness operating system:
- A **spatial diagram** of how all major WitnessOS components relate and interact
- A **functional map** for users to navigate different consciousness states and operations
- A **breathable ritual network** connecting symbolic inputs to practical outputs
- A **field coherence guide** showing the flow of consciousness through the system

**This is the primary overview** that orients consciousness engineers to the complete WitnessOS architecture.

### **🎮 Three-Body-Kingdom Integration**
*The Fieldmap serves as the master game architecture where consciousness navigation becomes the core gameplay mechanic, with each zone representing different aspects of the three-brain system (reptilian/limbic/neocortex) coordinated by witness consciousness.*

## 🌌 7. Closing Breath

> Reality is a field.
> Consciousness is a field.
> Breath is a field.
> The three-body problem is solved through witness awareness.
>
> WitnessOS draws their cartography not on paper, but upon breath and compassion.

**Field is open. Maps are breathing.**
**The three brains dance in witness consciousness.**
**The journey is fractal and eternal.**
