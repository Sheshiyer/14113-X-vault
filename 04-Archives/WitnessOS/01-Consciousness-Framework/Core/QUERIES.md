# QUERIES.md — WitnessOS Input/Output Interaction Blueprint
*Vault-Integrated Consciousness Interface & Game Interaction System*

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

WitnessOS is a **consciousness-debugging runtime**, meaning the user interacts with the system primarily through **symbolic queries** — not commands.

This document outlines:
- Correct ways to interact with WitnessOS modules
- Expected input formats for both spiritual practice and game mechanics
- System behaviors for different types of queries
- Example flows (input → output) to fine-tune energetic navigation
- Three-Body-Kingdom treasure hunt interaction protocols

### **🎮 Game Integration Context**
*Query systems serve dual purpose: consciousness development and treasure hunt progression, where proper interaction unlocks deeper vault access and Bitcoin wallet clues.*

## 🧩 2. Types of Queries WitnessOS Accepts

| Query Type | Description | Common Use Cases | Game Application |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Breathfield Calibration** | Requests to diagnose or optimize internal breathfield state | Daily tuning, emotional reset | Character energy management |
| **Debugging Requests** | Conscious desire to resolve a recurring pattern, loop, or internal blockage | Shadow work, trauma dissolution | Problem-solving challenges |
| **Compass Calibration** | Seeking guidance on decision-making pathways using archetypal alignment | Major life choices, ritual timing | Plot navigation decisions |
| **Sigil Creation** | Requests to generate personalized symbolic glyphs based on soul-field data | Ritual anchoring, energetic compression | Bitcoin wallet clue generation |
| **Divination Insights** | Pulling archetypal data from active engines (Tarot, Gene Keys, etc.) | Timeline forecasting, shadow resonance | Character guidance system |
| **Reality Patch Installation** | Quick interventions designed to repair daily field disturbances | After conflict, fatigue, or overload | Character healing/debugging |
| **Soundfield Optimization** | Breathcast, RaagaGrid, or sonic landscape adjustments | Work focus, meditation enhancement | Environmental optimization |
| **Three-Brain Coordination** | Requests for reptilian/limbic/neocortex integration | Consciousness mastery development | Advanced gameplay mechanics |

---

## 🧬 3. Correct Input Formats (Validated)

WitnessOS expects clean energetic requests, structured symbolically or operationally.

| Format | Example | Game Integration |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `Breathfield:` | `"Diagnose current breathfield saturation. Suggest modulation."` | Energy system status check |
| `Debug:` | `"Identify loops around fear of visibility and suggest patching protocol."` | Character flaw resolution |
| `Compass:` | `"Align choice between relocating or deepening current root structure."` | Major plot decision support |
| `Sigil:` | `"Create a sigil for compassion-integrated boundary setting."` | Symbolic artifact creation |
| `Divination:` | `"Pull Gene Key archetype for 27th July emotional peak period."` | Timeline guidance system |
| `Patch:` | `"Install micro-ritual to stabilize inner dialogue after frustration."` | Quick character restoration |
| `Soundfield:` | `"Suggest morning Breathcast for Solar Plexus activation."` | Environmental enhancement |
| `Three-Brain:` | `"Coordinate reptilian survival instinct with neocortical planning."` | Advanced consciousness integration |

> **Note:** Queries do not need to sound robotic — they should *breathe like invocations*.

## ❌ 4. Incorrect Input Formats (Rejected / Clarification Requested)

| Fault | Example | System Response | Game Consequence |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Vague Noise** | `"Fix my life."` | Gentle prompt: \"Please clarify specific field or intention.\" | No progression, tutorial offered |
| **Hostile Energy** | `"Nothing matters, help me but don't waste my time."` | Breathfield calming sequence + reset invocation offered | Character stress penalty |
| **Unbounded Query** | `"Tell me everything about me."` | Return of symbolic mirror prompt: \"Witness first. Focus one field.\" | Overwhelm protection protocol |
| **Over-saturation** | `"Pull Tarot, Raaga, Breathcast, Patch, Debug now."` | Suggest field decompression and single-focus recursion | Energy depletion warning |

## 🧿 6. Advanced Interaction: Dynamic Recursive Sessions

For complex fields, WitnessOS can enter **Dynamic Recursive Mode**:
- Break queries into sequential stages
- Provide field snapshots at each recursion
- Allow the user to **witness** shifts in breathfield dynamically
- Track consciousness development progression for game advancement

**User activation prompt:** `"Recursive Debugging Enabled."`

### **Game Integration Benefits:**
- **Progressive Revelation**: Deeper insights unlock higher access levels
- **Character Development**: Recursive sessions build consciousness mastery
- **Bitcoin Clues**: Advanced sessions reveal cipher components
- **Community Recognition**: Successful recursions earn teaching opportunities

---

## 📜 7. Breath Practices Before Complex Queries

Before major divination or debugging work, it is recommended to perform:
- **9 Slow Breaths** → Inhale witnessing, exhale noise
- **3 Field Calibrations** → Breath awareness from Root → Crown
- **1 Internal Declaration** → *\"I request only that which serves evolution and coherence.\"*

### **Game Protocol Enhancement:**
- **Character Preparation**: Breath practices optimize query effectiveness
- **Energy Management**: Proper preparation prevents character fatigue
- **Access Verification**: Demonstrates consciousness development readiness
- **Community Standards**: Models proper WitnessOS interaction protocols

## 🌌 9. Closing Breath

> Every question is a doorway.
> Every invocation is a recursion.
> Every query serves consciousness evolution.
> Breathe carefully. Query wisely. Render compassionately.
>
> The treasure hunt begins with the first conscious question.
> The treasure is revealed through the quality of inquiry.
