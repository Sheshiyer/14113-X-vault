# TESTCASES.md — WitnessOS Use Case Simulations and Field Resonance Examples
*Vault-Integrated Character Challenge Scenarios & Three-Brain Coordination Examples*

---

## 🌱 1. Introduction

**TESTCASES** are not "tests" in the traditional technical sense.
They are **symbolic simulations** — breathing blueprints of how WitnessOS flows in living fields and character development scenarios.

These examples demonstrate:
- How different modules activate and interact across three-brain systems
- How micro-rituals are deployed contextually for character development
- How breath, field, archetype, and three-brain coordination respond dynamically
- How treasure hunt progression occurs through consciousness mastery
- How character challenges become opportunities for growth and advancement

### **🎮 Three-Body-Kingdom Integration**
*Test cases serve as character challenge scenarios where consciousness mastery is demonstrated through three-brain coordination, leading to character advancement and treasure hunt progression.*
