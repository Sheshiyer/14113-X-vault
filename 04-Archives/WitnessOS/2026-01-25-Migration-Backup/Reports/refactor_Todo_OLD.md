### Media Organization Principles

#### Directory Structure Logic
```
03-Resources/Media/
├── Images/
│   ├── Generated/          # AI-generated images (UUID names)
│   ├── Screenshots/        # Screen captures and pasted images
│   ├── Diagrams/          # Mermaid diagrams and flowcharts
│   ├── Articles/          # Images for articles and content
│   ├── Brand/             # Logos, SVGs, brand assets
│   └── Archive/           # Deprecated or unused images
├── Videos/
│   ├── Recordings/        # Screen recordings and captures
│   ├── Generated/         # AI-generated videos
│   └── Archive/           # Deprecated videos
└── Audio/
    ├── Recordings/        # Audio recordings
    ├── Generated/         # AI-generated audio
    └── Archive/           # Deprecated audio
```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Generated Content**: Preserve UUID names with descriptive metadata files
- **Screenshots**: `screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD_description.ext`
- **Diagrams**: `diagram_system-name_description.ext`
- **Articles**: `article_title_image-purpose.ext`
- **Brand**: `brand_asset-type_description.ext`

#### Linking Protocols
- Use relative paths from document location
- Maintain link integrity during moves
- Document media dependencies
- Create media reference indices
