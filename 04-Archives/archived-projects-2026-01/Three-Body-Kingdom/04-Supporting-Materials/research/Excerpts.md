# The trauma of Birth

Life in itself is a mere succession of separations. Beginning with birth, going through several weaning periods and the development of the individual personality, and finally culminating in death - which represents the final separation. At birth, the individual experiences the first shock of separation, which throughout his life he strives to overcome. In the process of adaptation, man persistently separates from his old self, or at least from those segments off his old self that are now outlived

Like a child who has outgrown a toy, he discards the old parts of himself for which he has no further use ... The ego continually breaks away from its worn-out parts, which were of value in the past but have no value in the present. The neurotic [who cannot unlearn, and, therefore, lacks creativity] is unable to accomplish this normal detachment process ... Owing to fear and guilt generated in the assertion of his own autonomy, he is unable to free himself, and instead remains suspended upon some primitive level of his evolution."

## Psyche

By will, I do not mean will-to-power as conceived by Nietzsche and Adler, or "wish" in the Freudian sense, though it might include both these aspects. I mean rather an autonomous organizing force in the individual which does not represent any particular biological impulse or social drive but constitutes the creative expression of the total personality and distinguishes one individual from another ... This individual will, as the united and balancing force between impulses and inhibition, is the decisive psychological factor in human behaviour. Its twofold functioning, as an impulsive and likewise inhibiting force, accounts for the paradox that the will can manifest itself creatively or destructively, depending upon the individual's attitude towards himself and life in general

## Neurosis

Neurosis is neither the result of social inhibitions ... nor is it caused by the subsequent repression of impulses, but appears as the result of an excessive control on the part of the individual's will over his own nature

the neurotic type will feel and appear maladjusted in any environment

Each neurosis ... is a kind of revolution on the individual's part; a revolution not only against his environment and heredity, but also against the self representing both

## Fear of Life

The "fear of life" is the fear of separation and individuation. The "fear of death" is the fear of union and merger - in essence, the loss of individuality

## Three stages of Evolution

Pre-Sexual (Totemic) Epoch Man thought death was always unnatural Ancestors were the spirits that impregnated females Man unaware of his role in paternity Females and males promiscuous. (Age of Innocence.) Women able to sleep around before taboos imposed Women exalted because of the ancestral connection. Women exclusive owner of offspring.

Sexual Epoch Man discovers role in paternity (Resemblance ,etc) Realizes death is a natural occurrence. He loses his original comforting concept &guarantee of spiritual immortality. His world collapses.

Sexual Epoch Woman loses her exclusive ownership of offspring She also loses her exalted station as consort of ancestor spirits She is under the closer scrutiny of her husband (Marriage)

Sexual Epoch Man adapts to biological immortality through offspring Imposes restrictions of females Taboos against sleeping around

The Garden of Love BY WILLIAM BLAKE

I went to the Garden of Love, And saw what I never had seen: A Chapel was built in the midst, Where I used to play on the green. And the gates of this Chapel were shut, And Thou shalt not. writ over the door; So I turn'd to the Garden of Love, That so many sweet flowers bore. And I saw it was filled with graves, And tomb-stones where flowers should be: And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds, And binding with briars, my joys & desires.
