# Three-Body-Kingdom: Consciousness Assessment Methods
**Version 1.0.0 | Created: 2025-01-20**
**Purpose**: Scientific and experiential methods for validating authentic consciousness development

---

## 🧠 **Multi-Modal Assessment Philosophy**

### **Integration of Science and Wisdom**
Consciousness development assessment combines measurable scientific phenomena with experiential wisdom validation, creating comprehensive evaluation that honors both objective measurement and subjective experience.

### **Three-Body System Assessment**
Each consciousness development tier requires assessment of reptilian, limbic, and neocortex integration, plus witness consciousness development, using both technological measurement and community observation.
