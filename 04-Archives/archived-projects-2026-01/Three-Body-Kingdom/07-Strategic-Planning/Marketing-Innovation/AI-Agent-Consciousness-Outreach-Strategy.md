##### **Three-Body System Integration Response**
*"What you're describing sounds like the classic challenge of integrating what some call the 'three-body system' - the reptilian (survival), limbic (emotional), and neocortex (mental) aspects of consciousness. The key is developing what's called 'witness consciousness' - the part of you that can observe all three systems without being completely identified with any one of them. Have you tried [specific technique]? There's also a growing community exploring these concepts if you're interested in connecting with others on similar journeys."*

##### **Spiritual Bypassing Recognition Response**
*"I hear you, and what you're experiencing is actually quite common in consciousness development. Sometimes we can use spiritual concepts to avoid dealing with practical life challenges - it's called 'spiritual bypassing.' The most authentic consciousness development seems to happen when we integrate spiritual awareness WITH practical life skills. The 'Rumi meets Rick & Morty' approach - deep wisdom with grounded humor and practical application. Have you found ways to bridge your spiritual insights with everyday life challenges?"*
