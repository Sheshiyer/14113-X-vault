**Total**: ~12 JavaScript code blocks requiring replacement (Chapters 18-21 already clean)

### **Task 0.2: Sanskrit Authenticity Replacement** 🚨 URGENT
**Problem**: Random Sanskrit phrases without Vedic tradition connection

- [ ] **Sanskrit**: Authentic Vedic sources, consistent IAST transliteration, accurate translations
- [ ] **Narrative Flow**: Ensure replacements enhance rather than disrupt immersion
- [ ] **Cross-Reference**: Update AUTHENTICITY-CLEANUP-PLAN.md with progress

**DEADLINE**: Complete before any new chapter development
