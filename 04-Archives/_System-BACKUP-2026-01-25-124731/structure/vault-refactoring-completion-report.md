- Created relationship maps for key concepts
- Established clear navigation pathways
- Connected technical and mystical domains

### 3. Hierarchical Organization
**Logical Structure**
```
01-Projects/          # Active development and implementation
02-Areas/             # Knowledge domains and ongoing areas
03-Resources/         # Reference materials and content
_System/              # Vault infrastructure and tools
```

## Current Vault Architecture

### Core Navigation Hubs
