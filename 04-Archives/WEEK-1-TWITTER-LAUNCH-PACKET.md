## WEEK 1 CALENDAR

### MONDAY (Feb 10) — LAUNCH POST #1: PROVOCATION
**Hook:** Your consciousness isn't broken. Your OS is running legacy code.

**Single Tweet:**
```
Your consciousness isn't broken.
Your OS is running legacy code from childhood.

Those "automatic thoughts"?
Witnessing the system execute old programs.

The good news: You can debug the source.
The first step is seeing it running.
```

**Why this works:**
- Technical metaphor bridges ancient wisdom (consciousness) + modern tech (debugging)
- Addresses specific pain point (automatic thoughts/patterns)
- Offers agency without blame
- Positions you as technical expert in consciousness space

**Engagement CTA:** Reply with "What's one pattern you keep running?"

**Voice check:** ✓ Grounded (lived experience), ✓ Direct, ✓ Respectful (assumes capability)

---

### TUESDAY (Feb 11) — LAUNCH POST #2: BRIDGE THREAD
**Hook:** Why your manifestation scripts keep crashing

**Thread (5 tweets):**
```
TWEET 1:
"I want to manifest X" usually crashes because:

TWEET 2:
You're using a framework designed for previous-you.
Not a framework designed for present-you.

TWEET 3:
Your manifestation code was written when you believed different things about yourself. About what's possible. About who gets to decide.

TWEET 4:
So when you try to run "manifestation protocol v1.0" from age 15 with your current operating system... incompatible versions.

TWEET 5:
The debugging question: What would you implement if you designed the protocol for current-you?

Not tomorrow-you.
Current.
```

**Why this works:**
- Practical problem (manifestation) + technical solution (debugging code/frameworks)
- Bridges spiritual seekers + technical thinkers
- Actionable debugging question at end
- Uses your unique voice (technical-mystical)

**Engagement CTA:** "Which protocol are you still running from old-you?"

**Voice check:** ✓ Grounded (relatable problem), ✓ Direct (clear diagnosis), ✓ Respectful-challenging (reframes agency)

---

### WEDNESDAY (Feb 12) — LAUNCH POST #3: COMMUNITY QUESTION
**Hook:** Human Design for consciousness debugging

**Thread (6 tweets):**
```
TWEET 1:
If you've tried 47 productivity systems and they all failed:

Your Human Design profile might explain why.

TWEET 2:
Not a limitation.
An operating system constraint.

A Manifesting Generator (Me-to-respond) running "commit daily" protocols designed for Manifestors (initiate-then-act). Incompatible.

TWEET 3:
Your nervous system has specific decision-making authority:
- Sacral (respond)
- Solar Plexus (wait, then know)
- Emotional (cycle through it)
- Throat (speak it first)

TWEET 4:
Productivity systems that override your authority = your system fighting itself.

Of course they fail.

TWEET 5:
This isn't willpower.
This isn't discipline.
This is architecture.

Your nervous system is trying to tell you something.
Most productivity systems tell your nervous system to shut up.

TWEET 6:
What if you listened to your operating system instead of forcing foreign protocols onto it?

That's consciousness debugging.
```

**Why this works:**
- Specifically addresses audience pain (productivity failure)
- Introduces your unique framework (Human Design) without being esoteric
- Positions Human Design as practical OS, not mystical tool
- Invites self-reflection + potential coaching inquiry

**Engagement CTA:** "Which authority type resonates with you?"

**Voice check:** ✓ Grounded (lived experience with systems), ✓ Direct (clear diagnosis), ✓ Respectful (honors their system)

---

### THURSDAY (Feb 13) — LAUNCH POST #4: CONSULTING TEASE
**Hook:** When consciousness debugging needs a witness

**Thread (4 tweets):**
```
TWEET 1:
Most consciousness debugging is solo work.
You observe your patterns.
You rewrite your scripts.
You test new protocols.

TWEET 2:
But some patterns are invisible to the person running them.
Like asking your eye to see itself.

TWEET 3:
That's when you need a witness.
Someone whose OS sees patterns your OS can't.

TWEET 4:
I work 1:1 with people on this.

If that's you, the next step is a conversation.
DM if curious.
```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges free value (solo debugging)
- Introduces coaching naturally (need for witness)
- Uses metaphor (eye seeing itself) not hard sell
- Soft CTA (conversation, not immediate sale)
- Positions you as expert who understands limitations

**Engagement CTA:** Reply if you recognize blind spots

**Voice check:** ✓ Grounded (realistic about what works), ✓ Direct (clear offer), ✓ Respectful-challenging (assumes they know their limits)

---

### FRIDAY (Feb 14) — ENGAGEMENT DAY
**No new post** — Spend time replying thoughtfully to replies from Mon-Thu

**Engagement focus:**
- Answer questions about consciousness debugging
- Share relevant personal framework examples
- Look for people asking about patterns
- Build conversations (replies > likes signal)

**Sample replies:**

**If someone replies "My pattern is perfectionism":**
```
The debugging question: Did you choose perfectionism, or did perfectionism choose you (via family/culture)?

Most patterns aren't conscious choices. They're inherited code.

Knowing the source changes how you rewrite it.
```

**If someone asks about 1:1 coaching:**
```
DMs are open. Usually we start with understanding what pattern you're running. The pattern often reveals itself in the first conversation.

What pattern brought you here?
```

---

### SATURDAY (Feb 15) — REST
**No posting. No engagement.**
Observe what people are saying. Note which posts got replies (not just likes).

---

### SUNDAY (Feb 16) — REFLECTION & PLANNING
**Weekly review (30 mins):**
1. Which posts got most engagement?
2. What questions did people ask?
3. What pattern emerged? (philosophical vs. practical)
4. Any DM inquiries about coaching?
5. Which voice worked better? (technical vs. metaphorical vs. personal)

**Plan next week (1 hour):**
- Double-down on winning post types
- Address common questions in new threads
- Prepare 3-4 new posts for Monday start

---

## ANALYTICS TRACKING TEMPLATE

Create a Google Sheet with these columns:

| Date | Post Type | Hook (first 10 words) | Likes | Replies | Retweets | DMs | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----|-------|---------|----------|-----|-------|
| 2/10 | Thread | "Your consciousness isn't broken" | | | | | |
| 2/11 | Thread | "Why your manifestation scripts crash" | | | | | |
| 2/12 | Thread | "If you've tried 47 productivity systems" | | | | | |
| 2/13 | Thread | "Most consciousness debugging is solo" | | | | | |

**What to track:**
- **Likes**: Volume signal (people resonated)
- **Replies**: Quality signal (people engaged thinking)
- **Retweets**: Reach signal (others found it valuable)
- **DMs**: Conversion signal (coaching interest)
- **Notes**: What worked? ("Technical metaphor resonated" / "Human Design hook got most replies")

---

## WEEK 2 STRATEGY (Preview)

Based on Week 1 winners, Week 2 will:
1. **Double down** on highest-engagement post type
2. **Expand** on questions from replies
3. **Introduce** more specific frameworks (if Week 1 tested well)
4. **Soft-sell coaching** in natural conversation arcs

**If Thread #2 (manifestation scripts) wins:**
- Week 2 explores more "script debugging" examples
- Maybe: emotional scripts, relationship scripts, health scripts

**If Engagement (Friday replies) wins:**
- Week 2 increases engagement focus
- Maybe: ask more questions, invite more replies

**If Consulting tease wins:**
- Week 2 introduces more case studies
- Maybe: "Here's how consciousness debugging looked for one client" (anonymized)

## VOICE FRAMEWORK CHECKLIST (Before Posting)

Use before posting each tweet/thread:

**Grounded:**
- [ ] Rooted in lived experience (not theoretical)?
- [ ] Could only come from someone who's walked this?
- [ ] Feels authentic, not performed?

**Direct:**
- [ ] Every word earns its place?
- [ ] No hedging ("might," "perhaps," "maybe")?
- [ ] Clear and unadorned?

**Respectful-Challenging:**
- [ ] Assumes reader is capable?
- [ ] Doesn't coddle?
- [ ] Points to hard truths?
- [ ] Treats reader as equal?

**Additional checks:**
- [ ] No engagement bait? (polls, "like this if", "follow for more")
- [ ] No enthusiasm/hype? (exclamation marks only if rare + earned)
- [ ] Vocabulary aligned? (authorship, pattern, debugging, inhabitation — not journey, healing, manifesting)
- [ ] Length appropriate? (Twitter favors sparse, can extend in threads)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Engagement bait:** "Like if you've experienced this!" ← Don't
2. **False enthusiasm:** "OMG this is SO important!!" ← Don't
3. **Vague spirituality:** "Manifest your divine essence!" ← Don't
4. **Empty promises:** "This will transform your life!" ← Don't
5. **Hard selling:** "BUY MY COACHING NOW" ← Don't
6. **Missing specificity:** "Consciousness is important" ← Don't (too abstract)

**Instead do:**
- [ ] Name specific patterns
- [ ] Offer practical reframes
- [ ] Use technical metaphors
- [ ] Ask real questions
- [ ] Build conversation
- [ ] Soft CTAs ("DM if curious" not "CLICK HERE")
