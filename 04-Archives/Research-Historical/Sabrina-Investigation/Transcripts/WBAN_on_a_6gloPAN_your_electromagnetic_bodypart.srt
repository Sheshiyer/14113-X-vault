1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:10,060
Hi, my name is Sabrina Wallace, and my parents were both part of Space Force in 1969.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,550
Just happen to have pretty crystal in a similar shape.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:28,420
Now, a lot of people like to say stuff we don't necessarily like to come up and help folks understand things that are difficult to understand because, you know, everybody's busy right now preparing for drone warfare, electromagnetic drone warfare.

4
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,640
We did it in Iraq and then just before and you know, the country's going to war one way or another.

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:42,100
Whether or not it's going to be, you know, our own people or something else, we have a serious learning deficiency in the United States.

6
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,420
Whether or not it was engineered and designed.

7
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,600
I'm going to let other people talk about that.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:01,240
What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you exactly what it is that you need to explain to your own children so that we can avoid the mouth style revolution, I'm pretty sure is what they're actually getting mad.

9
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,440
And we're going to do that with education.

10
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,590
So I'm getting started.

11
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,710
We're not.

12
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,110
My name is Sabrina Wallace.

13
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,439
I am a child of an Austin.

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,469
And my family members are involved in black projects, seps special access projects.

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:31,909
So I am a BAIER member and my grandfather is Bernard Heinrichs here, and that name is Mr..

16
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,319
He married Helen Harding, and Helen Harding is directly related to Pius Levi.

17
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,400
My father was Steven Garland Davis.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,979
My mother is Lynne Gene Scheer.

19
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,969
They're both secret Central Super.

20
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:01,840
In 1969, working on Project Silence, I Am a Modified Child due to the Menninger Foundation Experimentation for Human Augmentation.

21
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,560
Now, all that means is that I have scars that most people don't have for John von Neumann architecture.

22
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,840
It's not brain to machine interface.

23
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,980
It's body mass.

24
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,320
That's impossible.

25
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,430
And it sounds What again?

26
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,050
I'm hanging in there.

27
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,840
So here's the wedding list of my parents.

28
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,690
Okay.

29
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,290
Okay.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,009
Here are the flight manifests out of Edgewood Arsenal for my great uncle.

31
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,379
65/70 Army Chemical, Fort Dietrich.

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
To where?

33
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,900
Texas.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,159
New York, North Korea.

35
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,099
Just one not good enough.

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,479
Eleanor Hall It's still for the three.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,680
I'm probably here was involved with the Mothman Projects and building Vehicles for the Men in Black.

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,969
Now, the interface for John von Neumann scars is right under here.

39
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
I see one there.

40
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,100
And of course, I'm older now, but that's your heart.

41
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:22,110
Okay, so this is body machine interface with an underground database called Next the longer, which is IBM.

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,440
So in my German class in high school, I spelled it wrong.

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,080
Nick fell on the right there.

44
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,910
Okay.

45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Why does that matter?

46
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:43,800
Because if people say stuff like this, they had better be able to show you evidence, viable proof, or else I wouldn't listen to them.

47
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:52,080
Okay, so here's a little more documentation, and then we're going to go ahead and get started with the intellectual discussion.

48
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,930
Okay.

49
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,720
So here's my family and Garland here.

50
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,949
My grandfather, Garland Davis, a World War two Marine.

51
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,869
Fort Meade, NSA.

52
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,640
Mm hmm.

53
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,539
And first, he married Elizabeth Kraft.

54
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,249
But I think something with the DNA didn't take.

55
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,500
So then he married my mother.

56
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,910
Aunt.

57
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,149
Okay.

58
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,220
So you worked for a company that was my parents and my great uncle.

59
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,379
Oh, sorry.

60
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,380
I forgot one thing.

61
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,610
My uncle, my great uncle is where I live.

62
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,620
So he's.

63
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,180
He's always been one of my favorite people.

64
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,620
It's a very kind man.

65
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Oh, come on with.

66
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,309
This time I had everything sitting right on the story.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,140
Okay.

68
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,140
Oh.

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,060
So Southern.

70
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,750
So I have a totally different story than my parents.

71
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,429
I was never told anything.

72
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,360
Nothing.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,190
So I grew up and I wanted it.

74
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,640
And they told me nothing existed except what you could see.

75
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,649
And I wanted to know what is all this electromagnetic stuff?

76
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,420
I grew up in the eighties, in the nineties.

77
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:24,589
I was born in 1979, and if you talked about the aura, everybody shoved you in a corner and demanded you join their group of readers.

78
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,170
And I was always sitting there like, You do realize it's a body part.

79
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,150
And I like, No, you're stupid.

80
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,300
You have to have a religion.

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,340
I never realized what I was.

82
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:39,230
I didn't know why people acted so stupid as in why would you lie about a body part?

83
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,629
And yet my parents were secret squirrels.

84
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,970
That's four levels of law enforcement above anything that civilians see.

85
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,410
And they're the ex.

86
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,410
The secret elite.

87
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,210
What?

88
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,160
It's a secret elite service.

89
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,169
And that's pretty much it.

90
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,609
Once you're there, that's secret law enforcement.

91
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,639
Right now, you've got to go another level up.

92
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,330
Okay, Now I got to go another level up.

93
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,290
They're serious.

94
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,900
Yeah, I get to go another level up.

95
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,420
Right.

96
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:15,359
So I went ahead and went to work for a company out of Louisville, Kentucky, called High Speed Access.

97
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,579
And this is when they sent me my papers to work for them to see right there.

98
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,889
They just they caught their old adult sweat.

99
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,959
This is the back into space for us.

100
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,149
The actual back end of this country.

101
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,620
I was one of two technicians to wire the state of Wisconsin from dial up to broadband.

102
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,530
So I'm very clear.

103
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:42,779
L-3 Harris or C 24, all the different ways that we handle with all sorts of intelligence, the NSA's PRISM program, all of it including data grams packets.

104
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,050
Network engineering is not the same as installing a cable modem.

105
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,310
I have to work with the plant technician and the plant engineer.

106
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,020
There's no one hiring a plant in that.

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,440
And there was no one hire in that position of me other than the one do.

108
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,170
Yeah, I was 19.

109
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:12,580
So for international tourism so that as I continue here and people have really had nothing to say to me because I'm exactly where I'm telling you I am.

110
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,310
Full body.

111
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
Pardon my dirty foot.

112
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,839
All right, so, Sister.

113
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Let's see.

114
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:48,559
I asked technical services, professional UW Whitewater monitored campus network, various software packages, including lots of gold in Maps network, vintage HP, open view in brief interactions with snort.

115
00:07:48,580 --> 00:08:02,450
Second shift operations include processing databases using PeopleSoft, eight updated coding routers and switches, work with Visio to create fiber map of campus initiated training For what's simple, of course, it's much a whole state like one little chunk.

116
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:09,019
When I went to the network operations center, Louisville, or did I want to build me one of those network consultants at Omni Resources in Green Bay.

117
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,930
Trouble OS conflicts, Student trouble, Shock West Conflicts.

118
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:33,529
The proprietary company developed software, assisted with Cisco Fixed Firewall stuff Program Assistant to Department of Corrections Wales, Wisconsin Installed and implemented In-house Tracking Program Facility Maintenance Department of Ethan Allen School for Boys Develop databases and access and provide a direction for Oracle Implementation Troubleshoot network and desktop issues within the departments and a Big Job.

119
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:45,830
October 1999 to May 22, Charter Communications maintained an upgrade and taught and troubleshoot ISP network comprised of Cisco three Kong Comm 21 and Bay Networks had five installed racks and had in season.

120
00:08:45,830 --> 00:09:14,509
Colin Cable management responsible for weekly and monthly report some bandwidth and circuit usage test returned cable modems, warranty or redeployment troubles, light coverage area of responsibility for over 12,000 customers installed and maintain Cisco AC 5300 servers for seven separate pools monitored bandwidth in configured Cisco 7200 routers with upgrades for 9000 customers and manage relations between cable operator and technicians in Plainfield, Illinois, while training new staff in the technical and administrative positions in January 2001.

121
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:23,389
Check out the software listing and that's something permanently disabled in 2004 for being depressed by her own government.

122
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,329
To close the door on this said Are you still telepathic going by projects?

123
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:36,919
You know, maybe don't you're but by now it's going to be fun.

124
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:46,279
So where are we going to go from here is we're going to take a walk into the reality of today in 2022.

125
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,430
And first, we're going to have a little lesson from the past.

126
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,259
In my job when I worked at UW Whitewater.

127
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,630
She has a huge magnet underneath her in a fixed low earth orbit satellite above her.

128
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:06,320
And during the seventies, UW Whitewater had a bunch of software that was laying around for all those underground Nick Furlong, IBM databases and such.

129
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,010
They're underground.

130
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,570
So that's not a maybe that's that's a certainty.

131
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,779
It has to do with cooling more than anything.

132
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:20,809
So again, as a kid, I'm growing up drawing things like this is they tested brain brain interface for synthetic telepathy.

133
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,389
And people have long since been lied to about that electromagnetic body part.

134
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,759
And now we're in a crisis in our country.

135
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,600
This is from 1993, and this is how the Zigbee Bluetooth layouts go.

136
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,770
This is what they look like.

137
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,870
And that's exactly also how they process in telecommunications.

138
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,750
And I'm going to show all that to me.

139
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,460
But I wish to point out that they were testing on children.

140
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,110
Yeah, that's what our government does.

141
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,139
The parents, my parents, they just hand you over.

142
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,710
That's their job.

143
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,979
It's secret deployment for synchronous.

144
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,470
Nope.

145
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,400
Sorry, folks.

146
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,539
No, I come back to that in just the same.

147
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:16,629
So this journey for me really started there with being a kid scanner action issues, which is really just me having control of all of my physiology instead of listening to people around me tell me a story telling me how to run me off from being able to just feel my own body.

148
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:24,600
And growing up from 1979, I have always found it bizarre, unusual, but I didn't know.

149
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,750
I didn't realize that the heart of surveillance was the human biofilms.

150
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,139
And once I did, that was not okay.

151
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:40,759
And my family made me go away for almost a decade because I wasn't allowed to say anything ever from Perch.

152
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,230
Chris It's the autumn years.

153
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:56,860
In 2019, I had a run in with an England one called an Ambulance, and on the phone the guy in the ambulance, he said, Get her to the helipad, take her to the lodge, get her to the farm.

154
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,590
Now I'm perfectly just saved by the government.

155
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,390
It was the first time I called an ambulance.

156
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,840
I wasn't prepared for that.

157
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,410
And then I knew the military was watching me.

158
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,650
And then I knew a mistake as set by our Defense Intelligence Agency via my parents.

159
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Not really.

160
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:18,160
I'm over here working for Charter, but being able to field radar and all these other electromagnetic signals.

161
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,289
That's natural.

162
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,130
The dog reacts the same way I do.

163
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,899
We don't tell people that unless you're in the Marine Corps for situational awareness.

164
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,719
Now, Stingray and dirt Bikes uses that same body part because it's electromagnetic.

165
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:54,040
And back in 1953, the great uncle, then he brought home a bunch of pictures and electromagnetic drones and 1953 and again, mom and dad in 1969 working on Project Salus, which controls about every molecular state that we've got going on inside of the human body and out.

166
00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:02,049
Now, if you look at cells now, they're going to tell you logistics and motion and basically everything internationally by molecule.

167
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,700
And you go, That's impossible.

168
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:12,890
That's because you don't know about the nano Internet of Things, the industrial Internet of Things, and that many of these machine interface systems, they were around in 1958.

169
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,200
So why why wouldn't you tell people?

170
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,109
I mean, Edgewood Arsenal.

171
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,419
We're testing on our own soldiers.

172
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,789
Vietnam with my grandfather again.

173
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,149
We've got electromagnetic drones in 1953.

174
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,540
What's going on?

175
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,010
Right.

176
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,020
So I came here to West Virginia and the weirdness with the ambulance and then it continues.

177
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,509
More weirdness, disappearing vehicles.

178
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,429
So going go to the bookstores and they have this question.

179
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,990
Oh, we're planning for the county.

180
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:55,489
I'm a homeowner, so I went ahead and went to building 60 newest stuff right here in a town of 200 people.

181
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
They were take.

182
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Seems weird.

183
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,690
Huh.

184
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:18,499
So that got me started researching six g lo pin and having come from network engineering and cybersecurity is one of my favorite places because I do math environments and it had to because I had to subnet the back end of space forces to four dot addresses which went on sale in Florida last year from that.

185
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Really interesting.

186
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,290
But I figured that out too.

187
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:32,869
So anyways, they when you are a network engineer and you're studying for your Cisco certified network associate back in the day you had to actually subnet in binary because we didn't have enough IP addresses.

188
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,150
So yeah, I read binomial math.

189
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,520
It's part of my job previously.

190
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,420
Okay.

191
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:48,080
And so when it comes to cyber security, this is the kind of stuff in this first part is totally full of just such boring stuff, like the side layers and the internet and stuff like that.

192
00:14:48,680 --> 00:15:01,490
So again, when you have to subnet and you have to insulate your customers and you're beholden to certain thousands of people and they will nail you for being $300,000 a minute of loss, it's charter communications at the time.

193
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,759
Then you have to know what you're doing and you cannot be wrong.

194
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,809
400 grand in a minute.

195
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,870
Yeah, it's kind of pressure you're under in a job like that.

196
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,290
Remember, there's only two people in the whole state that can handle that equipment.

197
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,400
So you don't get to go on vacations.

198
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,380
You basically got to babysit program.

199
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:16,890
Yeah.

200
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,119
So network security, 60 low personal area network.

201
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:28,609
And she is going to be using machine to machine meaning no humans involved in a ad hoc vehicle.

202
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,970
Note, for example, here's a striker, here's a drone.

203
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,219
Now, I've got a couple of problems.

204
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,120
First of all, you can't interrupt that drone.

205
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:43,580
Pentagon statement 3000.09 asserts over 11 years ago and you can find this on CSR.

206
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:53,299
For example, the the Pentagon in May this year, 2022 said I think that our commanders on the ground need to be able to read the machine learning.

207
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:02,300
Well, clearly the commander, the husband, especially the commander, did not attend the Artificial Intelligence Symposium on September 10th, 2020.

208
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:12,349
If the commander would have, he would know that this was no digital nervous system end to end with no humans involved in, I quote, Project Selous.

209
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,409
What did we learn back to product delivery?

210
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,410
Give them the code.

211
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,179
The Salus platform is used for NORTHCOM with upgrades out to vendors.

212
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,530
The game changer is the new neural prototype products are in development and go here.

213
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,310
So what?

214
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:32,029
New neural prototype Synchro for starters, the G Joint Artificial Intelligence.

215
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,320
What is Fuzing is a fuzing organization focuses on getting products out the door to people who are actually using them.

216
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:50,239
Then they argued about whether it was going to be Amazon hybridized networking services or digitized, and Microsoft and Amazon were like, or let me have a government contract.

217
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,140
Okay.

218
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,399
Then it got weirder for me.

219
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,249
And as I'm listening, they said data labeling services.

220
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,340
And I'm like, That's a massive database data curation.

221
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,919
And I'm thinking what vendor customers and I wrote, This is the Department of Defense.

222
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:13,709
So for that you can go over here to the beginning and it says so the team of the Jake I mean the Joint Artificial Intelligence Commission, the role of them is to make A.I.

223
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,629
real and everyone can and should implement artificial intelligence in everything they do.

224
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,640
Customers across the DOD.

225
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:20,899
What are your customers?

226
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
Watch this.

227
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:45,640
So Contrasting Tools is under the Tradewinds umbrella and project Maven and I quote hot conduits using smart sensors, Biosensors Wireless Working Group 82.1 5.5 Wireless Sensor Networks Specialized Working Group for the International standards of electronics and engineering excuse me, Electronics and electrical engineering.

228
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:54,460
And Project Maven uses Pathfinder and I to watch you walk around and think inside your house in real time.

229
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,710
And let's a quote MQ nine Tethered to ground project.

230
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:13,149
That's Department of Defense Directive 3000.09, which asserted again, that's why the commander was cranky because he's like, we can't hear these machines, we can't decode them by their nature and we can't get a signal through.

231
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:20,199
And I quote over here at the gate, we need to get IBM's system of the Air Force more cohesive with everything else.

232
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,190
We're going to create a digital nervous system end to end.

233
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,510
We need to redo at the DOD how to connect all the IBM's platforms.

234
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
What do they control?

235
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,700
Lesbians platforms, Autonomous vehicles.

236
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,430
You mean autonomous drones, tanks, regular Strykers, all sorts of things.

237
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,450
Planes, check.

238
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,770
What about anything else?

239
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,400
Absolutely.

240
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,960
Industrial Internet of Things in those billion that's got self-driving vehicles and it's all allied air.

241
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,989
But you thought that was only for the smart part should look into the RF engineering new way to save the day called the Green Road.

242
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,350
It's not new specialized fiber along the interstate.

243
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:12,519
When asked could you just use a little bit of light our move the mountainous side that's place monarchs and special access Curtis National Institute of Science and Technology for the government it pay people this is no joke black projects remember I don't really pay 45 grand for a whole toilet seat.

244
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
No, they don't.

245
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,350
But you know what?

246
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,210
They do the nasty irises.

247
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:36,400
For people to have a stack like this, they have to plug in five codes to hide where all the money goes and the resource allocation and the logistics and the shipping, and then the reallocation of special access projects people, and then the reallocation of whoever is in charge of guarding them, tracking them, tracing them, or the Department of Defense to a list for special access projects modification.

248
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,839
It gets out of control and it's all open source and you can read about it and look it up on Google.

249
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,179
So that's our problem here.

250
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,020
So you want to explain to me, what are these biosensors and what are you talking about?

251
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,369
An MQ nine Reaper drone.

252
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,080
It's tethered to my DNA.

253
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,920
What is going on?

254
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,260
And by the way, who are your customers?

255
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:57,920
Actually.

256
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Cybersecurity.

257
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,930
Yeah.

258
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,109
Artificial Intelligence First symposium.

259
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:19,309
They told them all the humans are out of the way, so I should put it that one to digital nervous system end to end for these platforms connected with the humans out of the process and into reasoning, enable the current manager directly using data science credit cells and.

260
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Since I was a kid.

261
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,710
Machine Interface Interviews.

262
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,000
Quantum databases.

263
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,079
Manager Correlation.

264
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,930
Now why would they do that?

265
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,190
So the new 60 personal area network is going to use your body to route the data.

266
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,480
And before you think, Oh no, they would tell us this was done in 2005.

267
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,720
That's what the wireless sensor network is.

268
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:55,400
The biosensors are basically permanent and lifetime since 2005 and since 2005 with Zigbee and Bluetooth, which is what I complained about before when I sent him in, I was just a kid.

269
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,180
Why does Zigbee and Bluetooth and these biosensors look exactly like this?

270
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,460
Because that's how it works.

271
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:23,920
The international standards for electronics and electrical engineering uses a wide body area network and 82.1 5.6 Electronic standards for wireless working group Wide Body Area Network 82.1 5.6.

272
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,750
And these are the four circles of their technical writing of what they're able to do through your body.

273
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,990
And as always, you know, we should have no more paraplegics and everything.

274
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,240
They can make your hands move.

275
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,349
They monitor your muscle tissue density.

276
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
They can make you talk.

277
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,570
They can.

278
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,039
And they do right now.

279
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,130
They monitor all these things wirelessly.

280
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:54,040
How is that possible If your body needs a wearable or are they using your router or are they using your switch as in or are they using your router or are they using something else?

281
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,979
I wanted to know, so I figured it out.

282
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:03,460
With the new cybersecurity here with the Stryker and she has to be machine to machine, just like the symposium at the DIA de said.

283
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:11,500
The problem is, is that autonomy is an empty N9 tethered to your DNA and that DNA generates an electromagnetic body part.

284
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,950
And nobody knows about that.

285
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,630
They call it the aura, they call it all sorts of stuff.

286
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,620
Oh, it's UFOs.

287
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,160
We don't know.

288
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Yes, we do.

289
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,470
Skunkworks, Raytheon.

290
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,490
I just showed you the picture.

291
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,700
The drone people can work for 40 plus years, get paid Really, Really.

292
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:24,850
Well.

293
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,850
We keep you in the dark.

294
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,799
Cyber security, military, you know, national security.

295
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,670
Oh, it's UFO skunkworks, Raytheon, Lockheed.

296
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,080
Everybody knows this.

297
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,040
They're vendors.

298
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,440
So what's all this stuff about psychic records?

299
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,010
Scientists.

300
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,999
They're inherent in human tissue.

301
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,999
So there was a book I used to have my students read when I taught about this as a kid.

302
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,039
Here it is in 1996.

303
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,760
This book was written.

304
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,349
It's called Integral Psychology.

305
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,450
And inside you're going to find what I just said about telepathy, empathy, precognition, all of it.

306
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,540
It's assigned to certain areas of the brain.

307
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,660
So are those sensor networks down to the nanoscale?

308
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:18,190
Then they put it on a proprietary software when they have to write for Zigbee and Bluetooth for those permanent lifelong biosensors and, you know, 2.1, 5.4, they are permanently affixed to your body where.

309
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,380
From the radio frequency syncs.

310
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,380
There are two of them.

311
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:37,560
They're going to pull all the electromagnetic energy, including the potentiation of minerals, out of your biochemical bloodstream and transduced them because your electromagnetic field here that you thought was worthless didn't exist, and everyone made fun of you.

312
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,949
It actually transducers anything electromagnetically.

313
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,660
Now we use synthetic radio.

314
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,279
This is a software defined radio.

315
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,369
Synthetic telepathy, just to agitate your skin.

316
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,089
A little electromagnetically transduced in and out, using your own body parts.

317
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,530
So how do you think they're up?

318
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,530
Computer data?

319
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
The same way.

320
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,329
The biosensors are literal magnets.

321
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,430
They're fixed and adjusted with voltage.

322
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,079
How to Wireless Working Group ADA 2.15.5.

323
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,090
And that's your personal area network.

324
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,990
These are your personal area network as well.

325
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:19,680
My time, as you can see right here, the six G Maupin may or may not have a body area network for security routing purposes.

326
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:31,589
They're routing their data through your tissue and I quote an exchange digital information using the electrical conductivity of the human body as a data network body area network.

327
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,569
So why don't we need a brain chip?

328
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,630
Because you've been wireless for 6000 years.

329
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:47,200
Chinese medicine, the meridians, chakras, those are nodal points on your body, electro electromagnetic telemetry.

330
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:55,570
So the permanent biosensors were rolled out to everybody up here in 82.1, 5.4, and they had to be permanent for Zigbee and Bluetooth, and that is what provides them.

331
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:08,649
And then the wireless working group meter 2.1, 5.5 takes care of all the different types of networks, then collects certain sensors from only certain bodies, open shortest path, first routing protocols or security driven reasons.

332
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,809
But they also, when they create them with Zigbee and Bluetooth, they have to select muscle tissue type.

333
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,990
Since 2008, they have to select heat so you don't smell death.

334
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,630
And so they were working on that until 2011, in 2013.

335
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:34,539
And now they have about 13 different routing protocols, but only about three of them are built to protect you from the information you incur by routing data through your body, which pulls minerals from your red blood cells to do so.

336
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:42,789
Now, it's a very minor level zero notice until too many companies are pulling on those statistics mathematically at the same time.

337
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,860
And here's what that looks like.

338
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:54,580
So right here in our little example, you may also want to note that these two are of six each have five nodes sticking out of them, have been labeled right here and one, two, three, four, five.

339
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:09,039
So for every little dot, you got five more and they're all electromagnetically accessible through the cloud commercially with Zigbee and Bluetooth, which again is actually, you know, 2.1, 5.4, because if they weren't, they couldn't sell Zigbee and Bluetooth in the wall.

340
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,930
They couldn't have used the Alexa that way.

341
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:18,400
All these different things communicate with these sensor networks, and they're all driven by artificial intelligence databases and they're all interlocked.

342
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,119
So if you are wireless and you're on the same wireless working group as your phone, which is actually, you know, 2.1.

343
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,679
So in a wide personal area network, they're routing their data through you.

344
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:39,429
Since 2005 and I can write an app for it and then I can play with you like this because these here are accessible since 2005.

345
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,160
You think people haven't had enough time to buy synthetic telepathy, wearables?

346
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,650
It's all written.

347
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:59,319
And if you didn't know how writing an app is not hard and the GitHub style it up with something called structured query language, hey, what's ask you out to the backend of Microsoft, Apache and WordPress and ask you all, Hi, this the Hadoop of style.

348
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:14,529
So these people in the nineties before this was rolled out in 2005, and by these people I mean my parents secret squirrel, secret law enforcement all this stuff for again for who again Space Force since 1969 signals intelligence etc..

349
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:22,989
Okay so they have something called brain brain interface, a synthetic telepathy and it's frequency driven peer to peer.

350
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,220
Yeah.

351
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,750
And they put on a helmet at their desk and they can cruise right through human tissue.

352
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,280
Again, these things are monitored in real time.

353
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,170
Tell us if that wasn't bad enough.

354
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:36,090
They also have you by all the collection databases that you see listed here.

355
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:49,779
So the TV, all of your senses, stuff, radar, Doppler and then the dirt boxes fly above your head and they communicate with the stingray software, which is written for individual sheriff's departments, depending on what type of databases they want to subscribe to.

356
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,910
So what you end up with, it's here's three bodies walking along the road.

357
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,559
There's two bodies in a house.

358
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:03,369
These bodies are now being utilized by that same driver because their bodies just happen to have the best security in machine.

359
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:09,609
To machine only uses those criteria and they're listed if you want to read through the machine, learning to watch the order.

360
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:15,039
And then the key to the separation of how many times they hit the node, how long they wait .06 second delay.

361
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,400
And it's the same in cybersecurity for everything.

362
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,040
Hello.

363
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Goodbye.

364
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,690
Intermittent.

365
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,320
Wait, stay.

366
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:32,109
And if you know anything about data hacking with packets for real and not just the software defined enterprise cloud stuff, meaning and mainly using software, I mean like the hardware side, they pull the whole packet apart down to the physical Mac address layer of your body.

367
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,430
That's the problem we're in.

368
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,169
That's why we're down to the wire here.

369
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,059
They're wired into their bone marrow.

370
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:43,959
And the way that Cisco McCann powers everything around them in the smart grid is when you walk, when you dance, and when you move.

371
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:54,369
And that's another portion you can read about in eight, 2.1, 5.5 and wide body area networks 802.15.6.

372
00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:02,559
So again, the problem we run into is that when you have three bodies walking down the road, these two are now firing tons of signals that told you every node is five more.

373
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,300
Now, all these sensors are going crazy.

374
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:12,190
This person here, the machine selects this person here, the DNA, your DNA, your body.

375
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:19,000
That is what creates the secure signal that the drone is using is propagating your DNA.

376
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,589
And that is exactly how it works.

377
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:27,760
So in order to stop this drone from firing anything, you have to stop your DNA from propagating.

378
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Why would they do that?

379
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,430
So one last time.

380
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,480
If you're unlucky enough and somebody gets hit with a bioweapon.

381
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,839
This is electrical transduction over the open wireless working group of wide body area networks.

382
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,300
So it doesn't matter what you believe in.

383
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,469
And it never did.

384
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,359
They did all that right here.

385
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,739
You were both psychic.

386
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:08,810
And then when they transduced humans and they do actual testing, which is wireless tissue engineering and wireless total piezoelectric control, neural mitigation for behavioral modulation.

387
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,560
We brain damage.

388
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,580
You mean very subtle nanoscale areas of your brain to keep your behavior under control.

389
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:19,760
Then we send you to people and tell you cognitive behavioral therapy will help you in cougar needs artificial intelligence programing.

390
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,310
We know if you say it over and over again, you're going to do it.

391
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,829
So why wouldn't they fix your epigenetic environment?

392
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,750
Because they're not interested in that.

393
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,350
Or they would have told people about this stuff a long time ago.

394
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:35,749
They were studying transport and they would test people for this for their science of abilities into bioinformatics and genomics.

395
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,430
Once your body could no longer transduced these electromagnetic signals, this unnatural, it's too much power in the bloodstream, in the bone, and your vascular system going.

396
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,070
Eventually it weakens the veins, the arteries, the skin, and then you're in trouble.

397
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,220
So are you pretending to get lost in the woods?

398
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,230
Did you go underground?

399
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,390
I'm kidding.

400
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
So this is what they did.

401
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,640
Nobody's told the truth.

402
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,060
Stingray and law enforcement was all wrapped up in 1972.

403
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:14,420
So I was used by the police chief with my brain or, scuse me, my machine body interface at the time, because they still had to have a study table with nano lipid or hydrogel so that they could go through and show it on a monitor.

404
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,150
That's what all those guards are.

405
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,069
So now everybody's quiet since 2005 and available commercially.

406
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:34,309
And again, the new standard for cyber security is a wide body area network which may or may not be involved in a personal area network which may or may not involve your iPad and all the rest of it.

407
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,710
The cyber security right here, February 2022, for the six time open digital I.D.

408
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,019
routing and the digital ideas made of your phone.

409
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,170
That's right.

410
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,080
Frequency and residence of your what?

411
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:52,579
Your DNA generated electromagnetic wirelessly accessible since 2005 commercially body part.

412
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,789
They never let you know about your doctor won't admit to it.

413
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,300
You'll learn.

414
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,000
We'll talk about it.

415
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,980
And if you try.

416
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
But make fun of you.

417
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,350
Why?

418
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,850
Don't you want total control and humans and have them on remotes to make them do whatever you want?

419
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,609
No free will, no ability to think.

420
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,450
I told you.

421
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,010
Neural mitigation with subtle.

422
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,090
What again?

423
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,140
Behavior modification.

424
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,820
One more time.

425
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,049
Vital signs, respiration.

426
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,470
Easy.

427
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,930
ACG monitoring monitor glucose hearing aid.

428
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,930
What are the non-medical uses of what you're putting through your bone?

429
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:32,359
Because when they do, your red blood cells have to operate to the routing and they will magnetically pull those excuse me, those minerals hard on my shoulder, right out of your bloodstream.

430
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:38,589
Well, video streaming data, file transfer sports, 3D, video, forgotten things, monitor.

431
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:46,979
And then one more time you will be allowed to do three things entertainment applications, PR and gaming and social networking.

432
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:52,660
Starting to see how the metaverse electroceuticals the Internet of Things, Internet of bodies, the cyber Internet of Things.

433
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,400
It's all tied together inside your brain there, here.

434
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:02,919
So when I tried to tell people how I am from blood projects and you got to understand this body part and if you don't start working with it, you start figuring it out.

435
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,099
This is drone warfare You're going to wait on you don't nobody.

436
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:14,559
So what you have to do is understand that the only thing you have right now is physiology first, which is to admit it's the body part.

437
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,660
They hit it for total human enslavement and they have it.

438
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,040
This is an amazing it's all done in the police department, in the sheriff's departments.

439
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:30,700
Like I said, they're finished in 1972, being able to talk to each other with synthetic telepathy and a bunch of little kids.

440
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:40,839
And then when we were teenagers, here came the rest of it with the 2013 was when they actually rolled out brain chip interface.

441
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,209
Professionally, people still don't know that.

442
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,700
They still think you need an actual chip in your brain.

443
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
You don't.

444
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:53,140
You just go buy a nano antenna with the right frequency for the wide body area network.

445
00:33:53,500 --> 00:34:04,660
It's like a hundred bucks and then you buy a $200 synthetic telepathy generating wearable that just goes inside of your cranial nerves to subtly and allows you to hear all the signals around you that are projecting on these networks.

446
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:13,389
These networks are connected to everything on the Internet of Things, industrial Internet of things, cyber nano internet of bodies, and make fun of you Internet bodies to them.

447
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:18,639
Like, as if you don't know the specificity, then you have to because then they said, Oh, but it's only in hospitals.

448
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,549
And I'm like, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

449
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,250
That's just silly is I mean, I mean, this is an engineer design.

450
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,870
Why would you leave it only in the hospital?

451
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,670
I mean, it wouldn't even function that way.

452
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,059
It's completely wireless, satellite, inclusive.

453
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,369
So at that drone chooses your DNA because that MQ nine has been tethered to you.

454
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,929
Remember I just pointed this out and I'm going to go said MQ nine.

455
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,849
September ten, 2020.

456
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:55,389
Artificial Intelligence Pentagon MQ nine Tethered to ground Project Maven Project Pathfinder with object Detection.

457
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,290
That's right.

458
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:03,760
In a cognitive body area, networks are becoming that confused because they use something called an adversarial network and they attack you.

459
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,920
That's right.

460
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,510
Because they're watching.

461
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,699
You think with those comments cognitive for cognitive radar watching you think in real time.

462
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,749
And it shows up in a little tiny outfit and they click a button.

463
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:26,159
They got a heart attack and a stroke or anything they want any molecule, any state we face state, it's all available to them since 2005.

464
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,250
Oh, bare minimum.

465
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,510
My parents had this procedure, so it's in 1969.

466
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,030
Every molecule on the planet, everywhere.

467
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,760
So how did we get here?

468
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,110
How did all this get in place?

469
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,780
No mental accountability, no mendacity, nothing.

470
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,300
We just let them get away with it first.

471
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,380
They were subtly electrocuting.

472
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,030
A lot of people got fibromyalgia, but nobody knew.

473
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,969
I said, a tumor is you have a tumor, but we can't physically find it.

474
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,520
It's just your brain is acting like it then pseudo seizure.

475
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,669
So, gosh, we don't know why you're having so many seizures then.

476
00:35:53,670 --> 00:36:01,199
Lupus, Lou Gehrig's disease, an autoimmune 80% of your immune system is in that invisible body part in 40 to 60% of your endocrine system.

477
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,000
So that's why all the hormones can never get under control.

478
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,739
You keep screwing with the electrical transduction of the basic cell structure of your largest organ.

479
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Come on, people.

480
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,990
And then they don't.

481
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,500
Diseases.

482
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,550
Oh, I don't know what that is.

483
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,480
They do.

484
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,560
The World Health Organization admitted to that Cancer is not my story to tell, which is why I leave it open.

485
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,270
So a lot of people already figured this out with cancer.

486
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,629
They're like, Wait, I'm sick that now you want me to take chemo?

487
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Like what?

488
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,800
And yeah, so not Mr.

489
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,190
Endo, but now we're all the way down here into sudden adult death syndrome.

490
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,389
Gee, we don't know why.

491
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:38,489
And when they move around too much and have oxygen transduced in the red blood cells, too much happens to be too much radar from Amazon shipping services.

492
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,840
There's too much regard from just regular companies for security.

493
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:52,889
Maybe it's just a regular company that's dredging geology or the top of a rock set or whatever the now it's pulling from your body to scan the area.

494
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:59,310
Again, it's just part of a wireless sensor working group up here of the ATO, 2.1, 5.5 and point four.

495
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,409
But now it's using your body because you are in the, you know, 2.1, 5.6.

496
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,270
And for our purposes, for this, instead of the Stryker, that's a satellite.

497
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,160
She needs your body in eight or 2.1, 5.6.

498
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,690
Those are permanent lifetime sensors since 2005 commercially available.

499
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:24,030
And the DOD is selling through the database access to you using our same census and Doppler and heat and light and where you live and who you talk to.

500
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:33,110
Which is why the whole reason that led me here was when I realized that my county, whoever it is that I live near, my little town of 200, is looking through my bloodstream.

501
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,669
That's still open and that's freaked me out.

502
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:43,380
I followed the link and I did the reading so nationwide and again, this is 2022 February for digital.

503
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,039
I did jumping a geofencing catching people so they can't leave their geofence.

504
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,370
But didn't anybody tell you you were wireless because they don't want to give you the remote control to your own body.

505
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:02,219
So what are you going to do about it when the radar comes at you and she's ready with her DNA to end you?

506
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,409
Because that's the lethal autonomous weapons statement I kept reading out of that college textbook.

507
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,510
Yeah.

508
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,239
So you can't hear it, right?

509
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,380
Your body won't hear it come in, whether it's drone or trans duct.

510
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,059
Yet that's a light on my channel, An Odyssey.

511
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:27,959
It's full of electromagnetic warfare survivors, people like myself that this stuff was tested on and then implemented at the industrial governance scale for the Defense Intelligence Agency, the NRO, or whoever.

512
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,250
We got to understand now is that you you're out of time because they're going to war.

513
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,900
And they've been at this since 2005.

514
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,179
And again, my family was in in 1969.

515
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,530
So here on my channel, I teach biofilm practice, I teach offensive and defense.

516
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:48,059
Defensive is great because then you're opening yourself around inside your own field and you're learning how to actually listen and breathe.

517
00:38:48,570 --> 00:39:09,090
But offensive biofilm practice came last week, and I have at least suggest that you observe it before you try it and before you do anything you're familiar with your body again and correct all the things they taught you wrong so that they could access you at the remote, take away your immune system, because what's going to happen is the plasma charges.

518
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,110
And if you watch that 2030 talks about this, those plasma charges.

519
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:13,860
Yeah, that's true.

520
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,800
Electromagnetic body part, you're going to feel it either way.

521
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:32,099
But if you have knowledge ahead of time, you're not going to be afraid and you're going to be better prepared to observe your environment topologically epigenetically and really understand the people who are complicit in all this stuff that's really evil.

522
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,699
They will tell you your biofilms start real or they won't talk about it.

523
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:41,610
And then if they're involved in about two thirds, it's the purposes of this country is involved.

524
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,389
They'll just pretend it doesn't matter and that, oh, it can't affect me.

525
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,999
I believe this is the center of the revolution.

526
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,100
They're trying on our country because our youth biohazard this stuff and they know how easy it is to purchase that 400 bucks and have telepathy and affect people in Hollywood.

527
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,600
They've been doing it for a long time.

528
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,950
Well, now they're taking it a step further with tissue engineering trends, magnification.

529
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,710
And I said to people, they're going to turn bottom of your arm into fish.

530
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,750
But then they're like, Oh, we're not in together.

531
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,750
And so now it's here.

532
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,020
There are doctors out there that are offering to change people's DNA and alter them into animal states, etc..

533
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,309
Yeah, we know that's what everyday it plays a part in.

534
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,020
Okay, So step one, you've got to get honest about your physiology.

535
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,070
You have an invisible body part and everybody knows except you.

536
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,300
That's a problem.

537
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,140
Why?

538
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,079
Because it's your body that's important.

539
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,330
The whole body instantly.

540
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,909
Now project that field.

541
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,160
Steamer sports.

542
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,660
That was whole.

543
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,740
Let's take a look at the bias that actually looks like it's electromagnetic energy, isn't it?

544
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,840
You hear that drones coming.

545
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,890
You're going to feel it.

546
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:28,999
Your body naturally does.

547
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,560
Algore seems for the birds.

548
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,909
All that stuff notes ley lines.

549
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,159
Military has been using them a long time.

550
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,260
Why didn't you know?

551
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,800
Why aren't you allowed to know?

552
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:40,639
Step one It's your body part.

553
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,520
Step two get right with God.

554
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,739
Prayer for people who are like one.

555
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:47,970
Jesus.

556
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,760
Okay, well, whatever you want.

557
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:51,410
Physiology.

558
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:51,920
First.

559
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,380
It's a body part and get right with God.

560
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,719
Prayer for people to represent all forms of love.

561
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,469
Then practice religions, whatever.

562
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,060
Okay, Notice are separated.

563
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,130
That whatever you believe in is the duty that loves you.

564
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,170
Knowing that there's something greater out there than yourself.

565
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:09,980
That's private.

566
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
That's personal.

567
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,360
Your soul, sovereign being in your skin.

568
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,840
Super.

569
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Okay.

570
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:27,739
So for anyone to have some magnets with voltage adjustment then handed it up to law enforcement and secret surveillance and no doctors, no nothing.

571
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:29,989
For how many years?

572
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,800
Then all of a sudden, after the project says, Listen, I'm going, Oh my God, we're in so much trouble.

573
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,449
Cats, dogs and goldfish.

574
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,270
And that's when I got really mouthy this year in April.

575
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,150
And I said, The bubble bitch, here's your veins and arteries.

576
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,540
They're fine.

577
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,649
Just fine now.

578
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,449
They're not put on much effort, that is.

579
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,510
But so much effort.

580
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,230
This is.

581
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,829
Watch carefully and then go view what the biosphere looks like when it fully expects.

582
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,610
Twisted.

583
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,770
Doomed.

584
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,480
You're not pulling the trigger.

585
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,020
You will be damn lucky if you can even get to my door.

586
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,610
And by the way, precognition, again, the book I showed you, Spiders eat with it.

587
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,100
So why are you still pretending that you are not in their Defense Intelligence Agency?

588
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:37,910
Pentagon databases with every dream that you have and that your precognition is also watched because in your tissue.

589
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,050
That's why spiders eat with it.

590
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,489
Same way with Algore.

591
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,360
It's all natural and everybody's always like, Oh, I love being in nature.

592
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,710
Why all these wires and things?

593
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,210
And pretty soon they're going to go away.

594
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,469
And most people didn't know that we had all this scrub atomic plasma and all the rest of it.

595
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:58,760
We had it in the 1800s and they took it away for 150 years so they could sell you back your immune system and lock you up.

596
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:04,700
Now they have we don't have your bio fuel and the upcoming electromagnetic warfare.

597
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,950
You will not survive.

598
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,390
It's that simple.

599
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,290
So your chances now and you don't have much time.

600
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,390
1953.

601
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,970
What do you think they got now?

602
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,060
You.

603
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,860
And then.
