# System Quiz

## Question 1
In the Selemene Engine architecture, which programming language is specifically allocated for the 'Bridges' that handle symbolic interpretation, such as the Archetypal Mirror and Hexagram Navigation?

- [x] TypeScript
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Neo-Sanskrit
- [ ] Solana

**Hint:** Consider the distinction between precision computation and high-level symbolic translation within the system's stack.

## Question 2
The Guardrail Dyad consists of two witness agents, Aletheios and Pichet. Which of the following accurately describes the specific architectural function of Pichet?

- [x] Vitality, instinct, and novelty to counteract stagnation.
- [ ] Coherence, reflection, and analysis to counteract overwhelm.
- [ ] The preservation of hidden memory and the logic of concealment.
- [ ] Direct arbitration between the eleven Rust core engines.

**Hint:** Look for the agent associated with 'The Conqueror' and the Right Pillar of the system's architecture.

## Question 3
Under the 'Bioluminescent Architecture' (V2) visual identity, what is the specific distribution and role of the color 'Void Teal' ($\#0A1628$)?

- [x] $60\%$ distribution for primary backgrounds and deep surfaces.
- [ ] $30\%$ distribution for text, cards, and breathing space.
- [ ] $10\%$ distribution for CTAs and interactive accent highlights.
- [ ] Support role used exclusively for circuit-trace filigree and borders.

**Hint:** This color represents the primary substrate and deep potential of the V2 visual system.

## Question 4
The Kopina sacral interface utilizes $PVDF$ fibers. What is the fundamental material science mechanism that allows these fibers to power the system?

- [x] The piezoelectric effect, harvesting energy from biomechanical movement.
- [ ] The photoelectric effect, capturing ambient light via solar mesh.
- [ ] Thermoelectric generation, utilizing the delta between body and air temperature.
- [ ] Magnetic induction through the copper-thread circuitry.

**Hint:** Focus on the property of certain materials to generate electricity when subjected to mechanical pressure or movement.

## Question 5
In the Tryambakam Noesis lexicon, the traditional term 'Vimshottari Dasha' is functionally bridged to which brand-native term?

- [x] Chronofield
- [ ] Temporal Grammar
- [ ] Circadian Cartography
- [ ] Resonance Architecture

**Hint:** Think of the engine that maps active 'life chapters' and long-term planetary timing.

## Question 6
Which specific 'Purushartha' or Vector represents material purpose and the right relationship with wealth and resources?

- [x] Artha
- [ ] Dharma
- [ ] Kama
- [ ] Moksha

**Hint:** This vector is associated with the 'Infinite Treasure Hunt' and the right relationship with means.

## Question 7
The voice of Tryambakam Noesis is described as 'The Anatomist Who Sees Fractals.' Which of the following is an 'Avoid' directive when writing in this voice?

- [x] Using warm and nurturing 'hand-holding' language.
- [ ] Using structural humor and irreverent precision.
- [ ] Describing the body as a circuit or precise machinery.
- [ ] Addressing the 'watcher' or the seeker itself.

**Hint:** Think about how the system views the user's intelligence and the desired emotional distance of the guide.

## Question 8
What is the 'Success Metric' that defines when the Tryambakam Noesis system has performed its function correctly for a participant?

- [x] The user reaches a state of independence and no longer needs the system.
- [ ] The user maintains a $500$-day streak of daily inquiry exercises.
- [ ] The user achieves a 'Siddhi' or fully activated state in the Gift-Shadow spectrum.
- [ ] The user transitions from the Free tier to the 1:1 Mentorship tier.

**Hint:** Traditional systems want you to stay; this system's goal is the opposite.

## Question 9
How do the 'Somatic Canticles' differ from a traditional online course or book in terms of user engagement?

- [x] Access to chapters is restricted based on the user's Three-Wave biorhythm cycles.
- [ ] They are delivered as high-density manga to bypass intellectual resistance.
- [ ] They require a subscription to maintain access to the full digital framework.
- [ ] They are designed to be 'binge-read' to create an opening for transformation.

**Hint:** Consider the role of the 'Three-Wave Cycle' in the product's delivery architecture.

## Question 10
In the V2 visual identity, the 'Sigil' has been updated from a cartographic mark to which of the following?

- [x] Three converging fiber-optic filaments of illuminated glass.
- [ ] A stylized third-eye within a copper Sri Yantra geometry.
- [ ] An anatomical drawing of the vertebral pole as a circuit board.
- [ ] A titanium-etched hexagram representing the $64$ states of navigation.

**Hint:** The new sigil uses a 'bio-digital' metaphor involving filaments and a phosphorescent nexus.

## Question 11
Which engine is responsible for mapping organ activation to the time of day, used to determine when specific physiological functions are dominant?

- [x] Circadian Cartography
- [ ] Temporal Grammar
- [ ] Bioelectric Field
- [ ] Resonance Architecture

**Hint:** This engine is based on the 'Organ Clock' tradition but uses a functional brand name.

## Question 12
According to the 'Nomenclature Corrections' document, why should the term 'Bioelectric signaling amplification' be used instead of 'Chakra activation'?

- [x] It provides a technical mechanism that earns wonder through specificity.
- [ ] The term 'Chakra' is proprietary to traditional Vedic institutions.
- [ ] 'Activation' implies a binary state that the engines cannot calculate.
- [ ] It prevents the system from being associated with Eastern philosophy.

**Hint:** Reflect on the 'Anatomist Who Sees Fractals' principle regarding the earning of wonder.
