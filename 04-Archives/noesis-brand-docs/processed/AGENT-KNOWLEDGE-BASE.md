## 👤 BUYER PERSONA: "SEEKER SIMON"

### Demographics
- **Age:** 32-48
- **Income:** $75K-200K+
- **Location:** Urban centers, digital nomads, retreat communities
- **Occupation:** Founders, creative directors, consultants, therapists, writers, engineers questioning their path

### Core Frustration
> "Every system positions me as user, not author — and every system operates within a single tradition."

### Failed Solutions (The 5 Methods)
1. **Therapy** — Insight without authorship
2. **Meditation Apps** — Technique without philosophy
3. **Productivity Systems** — Efficiency without orientation
4. **Retreats** — Peak experiences without integration
5. **Self-Help Books** — Information without multi-engine synthesis

### Emotional Drivers
1. Exhaustion with performative growth culture
2. Longing for genuine integration
3. Fear of remaining a passenger in their own life
4. Desire to understand the "operating system" beneath behavior
5. Seeking meaning that survives scrutiny

### 20 Desired Outcomes
Key ones: Unshakeable clarity, generate insight (not consume), freedom from borrowed meaning, sovereignty over attention, creative output from coherence, end of seeking as escape.

### 21 Anti-Goals
Key ones: No guru dependency, no gamification, no subscription-based completeness, no techniques without understanding, no single-tradition systems claiming completeness.

### Soundbites (Formal)
- "Therapy helps me understand my story; Tryambakam Noesis helps me understand the storyteller."
- "Meditation taught me to watch thoughts; Tryambakam Noesis teaches me to examine the watcher."
- "Productivity optimized my actions; Tryambakam Noesis examines who chose them."

### Soundbites (Casual)
- "I've optimized the hell out of a life I never consciously chose. Classic."
- "My therapy notes are pristine. My actual decisions? Still running legacy code."
- "Did ayahuasca, got cosmic downloads, came back to the same salary negotiations."

## 🏛️ PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE

### Name Etymology
- **Tryambakam** (Sanskrit): "The Three-Eyed" — Shiva reference, destroyer of ignorance through triple-vision
- **Noesis** (Greek): "The act of knowing" — direct intellectual apprehension, knowing aware of itself

### Core Concept
**16 Engine Stack** (11 Rust + 5 TypeScript) + **Dual Guardrail Dyad** = Coherence architecture

### The 7 Core Offerings

| # | Offering | What It Is | Key Value |
|---|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Witness Agents (Aletheios & Pichet)** | Two guardrails regulating inquiry depth | Prevents overwhelm, keeps you as author |
| 2 | **Somatic Canticles** | Three-Wave Cycle-synchronized trilogy | Content arrives when body is ready |
| 3 | **Symbolic Narratives (The Plumber)** | 12-episode manga series | Bypasses intellectual resistance |
| 4 | **Infinite Treasure Hunt** | Purushartha (The Four Vectors) commentaries with crypto game | Rewards depth, builds internal compass |
| 5 | **Decision Mirrors** | 16-engine + biological data oracle | Real decision support without prescription |
| 6 | **.init Protocols** | 16 micro-rituals, 4 spins (Entry/Cultivation/Integration/Independence) | Daily grounding practice |
| 7 | **Ritual Objects** | Physical artifacts (7 categories) | Bridges symbol and body |

### The 16 Engine Stack

**Rust Engines (11):**
- Temporal Grammar (Vedic calendar)
- Chronofield (planetary periods)
- Energetic Authority
- Gift-Shadow Spectrum
- Numeric Architecture
- Three-Wave Cycle
- Circadian Cartography
- Bioelectric Field
- Physiognomic Mapping
- Resonance Architecture (sound/raga)
- Active Planetary Weather

**TypeScript Engines (5):**
- Archetypal Mirror
- Hexagram Navigation
- Nine-Point Architecture
- Geometric Resonance
- Sigil Forge

### Engagement Phases
1. **Entry** — Witness Gate + .init protocols
2. **Cultivation** — Engine engagement + Somatic Canticles
3. **Integration** — Decision Mirrors + Treasure Hunt
4. **Independence** — Goal: User outgrows system

### Pricing Model
- **Current: FREE PREVIEW** — All 16 engines, zero cost, no signup
- **Future: One-time acquisition** via Solana (post-traction, ~3 months)
- **No subscription** (no incentive for continued dependency)
- **Limited availability** (by design, not scarcity theater)

## 🗣️ VOICE & TONE

### The Anatomist Who Sees Fractals
- **Precise but playful** — Maps the body like a circuit and the circuit like a cosmos
- **Direct** — No hedging, no softening — but structural humor is welcome
- **Respectful-Challenging** — Assumes capability, doesn't coddle
- **Voice DNA**: Rick & Morty (meta-genius) + Alan Watts (paradox) + Alex Grey (anatomy + Sacred Mirrors)

### Voice Is NOT:
- Warm/nurturing (it's respectful, not parental)
- Mystical/ethereal (grounded, not floating)
- Academic/detached (embodied, not merely analytical)
- Motivational/pumped (measured, not performative)

### Vocabulary DNA

**USE FREELY:**
authorship, coherence, integration, inquiry, pattern, structure, cultivation, capacity, sovereignty, recursive, meta, kha, triangulation, engine coherence, witness gate, symbolic recursion, field cartography, the three-eyed view, arbitration, multi-engine, three-wave-cycle-synchronized, purushartha, coherence matrix

**USE CAREFULLY:**
consciousness, awareness, spiritual, sacred (can trigger dismissal)

**AVOID:**
journey, healing, manifesting, vibration, authentic self, optimization, hacks, tribe, admin layer, code well, guardrail dyad, engine stack
