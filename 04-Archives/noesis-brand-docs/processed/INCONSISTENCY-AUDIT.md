## REMAINING (Non-Critical)

### Placeholder URLs (Require User Input)
- [ ] 08-press-release.md — `[WEBSITE URL]`, `[CITY], [DATE]`, `[name]`, `[email]`
- [ ] 09-launch-email-sequence.md — `[ACQUIRE...]` and `[Link]` placeholders

### Legacy Python Scripts (Out of Scope)
- generate-*.py and v2-generate-*.py still reference old engine names and "13 Engine Stack"
- These are image generation code, not brand docs — require separate code migration

## SOURCE OF TRUTH HIERARCHY

| Priority | Source | Authority For |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | **GitHub: Sheshiyer/Selemene-engine** | Engine count (16), names, tech stack, API, workflows (6) |
| 2 | **LEXICON-MAP.md** | Terminology (brand-native names for public use) |
| 3 | **The 7 Decisions** (above) | Architecture, voice, palette, naming |
| 4 | **ECOSYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md** | 7-layer structure, cross-pollination |
