---

### Category 2: Symbolic Objects

**Physical Specs**:

## 2. Packaging Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Material Honesty** - No false luxury, no greenwashing
2. **Functional Beauty** - Protection first, aesthetics emerge from function
3. **Minimal Waste** - Every component has purpose
4. **Tactile Ritual** - Opening the box is part of the practice
5. **No Branding Overload** - Logo once, messaging sparse

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)
- ❌ Glossy, coated finishes (feels commercial)
- ❌ Excessive padding/filler (wasteful)
- ❌ "Congratulations!" energy (feels transactional)
- ❌ Multiple branded inserts (feels marketing-heavy)
- ❌ Plastic anything (unless absolutely necessary for protection)

---

---

### Hidden Element 3: Origami Insert (Optional)

## 9. Eco-Friendliness & Sustainability

### Material Choices

**Tone**: Factual, not virtue-signaling

3. **Test opening experience** with 3-5 people from target persona
4. **Evaluate**:
   - Does it feel aligned with brand?
   - Is protection adequate?
   - Does it create the right emotional tone (grounded, substantial)?
   - Any confusion or disappointment?

### Production Phase
1. **Minimum order**: 250 units (mix of styles if needed)
2. **Quality check**: First 10 units inspected before full run
3. **Storage**: Flat-packed boxes store easily (1000 units = minimal space)
