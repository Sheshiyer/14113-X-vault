## Week 1: Pattern Recognition
*Name what people already feel*

### Day 1 (Monday) — Provocation
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "You've optimized thoroughly. The question 'optimized for what?' surfaces at 3 AM."
**Format**: Single tweet
**Media**: None

---

### Day 2 (Tuesday) — Insight
**Platform**: Twitter Thread
**Hook**: "The pattern connecting therapy, meditation apps, courses, and retreats:"
**Thread**:
1. Therapy gives you narrative about your patterns. Not authorship of new ones.
2. Meditation apps teach you to observe thoughts. Not examine the observer.
3. Courses deliver frameworks. Not capacity to generate your own.
4. Retreats offer openings. Not architecture for inhabitation.
5. The common thread: all position you as user, never as author.
6. This isn't criticism. It's pattern recognition.

---

### Day 3 (Wednesday) — Process
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "Building something designed to make itself unnecessary."
**Body**: "The metric isn't retention. It's independence. Thirteen traditions. Two witnesses. One coherence matrix. Zero dependency. Most business models can't survive that logic."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 4 (Thursday) — Provocation
**Platform**: LinkedIn
**Hook**: "I've read 200 books on meaning. I still can't find my own."
**Body**: "Knowledge about frameworks ≠ capacity to generate insight. Information accumulation is often the most sophisticated form of avoidance. The question isn't 'what else should I read?' It's 'what would change if I stopped reading and started examining?'"
**Media**: None

---

### Day 5 (Friday) — Insight
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "The exhaustion you feel isn't from seeking."
**Body**: "It's from seeking within structures that need your dependency to survive."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 6 (Saturday) — Rest
*No post — silence is signal*

---

### Day 7 (Sunday) — Signal
**Platform**: Twitter + Instagram
**Hook**: "Working on something. For those done with borrowed frameworks."
**Body**: "Email list opens next week."
**Media**: Simple text graphic (Deep Ink background, Bone text)

---

## Week 2: The Upstream Move
*Introduce the grammar distinction*

### Day 8 (Monday) — Provocation
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "Most systems teach you how to use tools. What if you learned the grammar behind tools?"
**Format**: Single tweet
**Media**: None

---

### Day 9 (Tuesday) — Insight
**Platform**: Twitter Thread
**Hook**: "Three questions that reveal whether you're operating upstream or downstream:"
**Thread**:
1. When you meditate, can you explain *why* the technique works—not just that it does?
2. When you journal, do you examine the framework you're using to journal?
3. When you seek advice, do you notice *how* you filter what you accept?
4. Downstream: using the tool
5. Upstream: understanding the grammar of the tool
6. The shift is significant.

---

### Day 10 (Wednesday) — Process
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "What I'm building isn't a product, platform, or course."
**Body**: "It's a living inquiry field. A place to develop capacity, not consume content. The work is being built in public—not as performance, but as coherence."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 11 (Thursday) — Provocation
**Platform**: LinkedIn
**Hook**: "Your meditation app has a business model that depends on your continued incompleteness."
**Body**: "Subscriptions require ongoing need. Streaks require ongoing engagement. Gamification requires ongoing dopamine. None of this is evil. But it's worth noticing: the system's success and your independence are not aligned. What if your body's biorhythm determined when you could read the next chapter? That's how Tryambakam Noesis delivers its narrative trilogy. A system that succeeds by making itself unnecessary."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 12 (Friday) — Insight
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "Insight without authorship is just entertainment."
**Body**: "You can understand your patterns perfectly and still live them. The question is: who authors the next version?"
**Media**: None

---

### Day 13 (Saturday) — Rest
*No post*

---

### Day 14 (Sunday) — Signal
**Platform**: All
**Hook**: "Tryambakam Noesis list is open."
**Body**: "For those interested in what's being built. First access when it's ready. No filler content. [Link]"
**Media**: Simple text graphic

---

## Week 3: Building in Public
*Show the process and thinking*

### Day 15 (Monday) — Process
**Platform**: Twitter Thread
**Hook**: "Why I'm building Tryambakam Noesis in public:"
**Thread**:
1. Most meaning systems ask for trust before examination.
2. "Believe this, then test it" is backwards.
3. Building in public inverts that: examine while it's being made.
4. See the decisions. Question the assumptions. Use only what survives your scrutiny.
5. This is slower. It's also more honest.

---

### Day 16 (Tuesday) — Provocation
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "The guru model fails not because gurus are bad."
**Body**: "It fails because it creates dependency by design. The question isn't 'is this teacher trustworthy?' It's 'does this structure develop my independence?'"
**Media**: None

---

### Day 17 (Wednesday) — Insight
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "The greatest leverage a human can develop is not knowledge."
**Body**: "It's the ability to generate the next right question."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 18 (Thursday) — Process
**Platform**: LinkedIn
**Hook**: "The hardest design constraint: success = obsolescence"
**Body**: "Tryambakam Noesis is designed to succeed when users no longer need it. Thirteen traditions. Two witnesses. One coherence matrix. Zero dependency. This breaks most business logic. It also aligns the system's interest with the user's interest—which is rare, and intentional."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 19 (Friday) — Provocation
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "Community is often just loneliness wearing a spiritual costume."
**Body**: "Belonging isn't coherence. Coherence emerges from practice. The practice doesn't require an audience."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 20 (Saturday) — Rest
*No post*

---

### Day 21 (Sunday) — Signal
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "Week 3 of building Tryambakam Noesis in public."
**Body**: "Thank you to everyone who joined the list. Your replies are shaping the work. If you're not on it yet: [link]"
**Media**: None

---

## Week 4: Pre-Launch
*Direct invitation and final positioning*

### Day 22 (Monday) — Insight
**Platform**: Twitter Thread
**Hook**: "What Tryambakam Noesis is (and isn't):"
**Thread**:
1. Not a course. No content to complete.
2. Not an app. No streaks to maintain.
3. Not a community. No belonging to perform.
4. Not therapy. No one interpreting for you.
5. It's a living inquiry field.
6. A place to develop the capacity for self-authored meaning.
7. It succeeds when you no longer need it.

---

### Day 23 (Tuesday) — Provocation
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "If someone promises transformation on a timeline, they're selling you something."
**Body**: "Tryambakam Noesis doesn't promise transformation. It offers conditions for examination. The difficulty is the practice."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 24 (Wednesday) — Process
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "Final week before Tryambakam Noesis opens."
**Body**: "For those on the list: you'll be first. For those considering: [link]. Limited availability by design, not scarcity theater."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 25 (Thursday) — Provocation
**Platform**: LinkedIn
**Hook**: "The market for meaning is saturated. The capacity for meaning is underdeveloped."
**Body**: "The problem isn't technique. It's that no system integrates Vedic timing with Western archetypal insight with your body's actual biosignals. That's what Tryambakam Noesis enables. We don't need more frameworks to consume. We need to develop the capacity to examine how frameworks form. Opening soon."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 26 (Friday) — Insight
**Platform**: Twitter
**Hook**: "The shift from 'What should I do?' to 'Who is asking?'"
**Body**: "That's the move. Everything else follows."
**Media**: None

---

### Day 27 (Saturday) — Rest
*No post*

---

### Day 28 (Sunday) — Signal
**Platform**: All
**Hook**: "Tryambakam Noesis launches this week."

**Media**: Launch graphic

---

**Media**: None
